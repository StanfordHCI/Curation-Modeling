DIY,removed,im sure her and her boyfriend will love it
DIY,removed,all this for a long distance girlfriend
DIY,removed,boiiii you about to get laid on your next meet
DIY,removed,sorry but this is going to creep out your long distance girlfriend if it doesnt theres something wrong with her im tired of seeing guys go about everything all wrong and then they get praise for being oblivious in their approach to women i feel like im living in the twilight zone on this stuff i observe things over and over and over again in my daily life that indicate what women respond positively to on a sexual level then the entire worldand especially womentell me no its not like you observe its actually the opposite what people say and their actions dont seem to line up at all its just a weird phenomenon ive been grappling with lately and it extends to so many areas of life not just in dealing with women
DIY,removed,thats what hell say when he finds out his long distance girlfriend is sleeping around
DIY,removed,its funny because her side guy is giving her a good dicking for her birthday
DIY,removed,thats gonna make it sting that much more when you find out shes been cheating on you

DIY,removed,and im just sitting here masturbating
DIY,removed,who the hell spells their name elisabeth im not one to be saying that though i have a fairly common name that has one letter changed and for my first years in school every teacher would get my name wrong and make it sound like a girls name for the first week of each class

DIY,removed,i am sure your girlfriend will pretend to love your shitty gift thats absolutely useless to her

DIY,removed,wow amazing work this is probably a bad time to tell you but you misspelled her name s instead of a z should be an easy fix for someone with your skills
DIY,removed,no grammar nazism intended but automata is plural the singular is automaton source im greek

DIY,removed,hes a pro posting in rdiy he just did this without being paid by anyone else its a chronic problem here for the very simple reason that theres not really a good place to draw the line im not hating but lets face it a basic deck is within the capabilities of someone who has never worked with wood before but is capable of reading books and following instructions hard but doable something like this a full restoration of a classic car including full rewiring interior replacement with extra gauges etc you need a huge tool set just to begin considering doing this engine hoists empty garage space etc etc as impressed as i am and i am impressed this really doesnt belong here
DIY,removed,nice taste in beer except for the sam adams haha
DIY,removed,im fairly sure you cant i spent on a post and gets lots of upvotes

DIY,removed,jizz trees are the worst luckily theyve all stop blooming so the smells gone
DIY,removed,had jizz trees at my first apartment made for some awkward morning walk banter
DIY,removed,even though thats not ops tree it sounds like they did illegally cut down and remove some live manzinita detritus would likely already be too old to work with from what the slideshow described
DIY,removed,manzanita is an endangered species you idiot
DIY,removed,as soon as you enter the original disneyland youre hit with the unmistakable scent of jizz from the trees they have there makes me laugh every time at least i hope its from the trees
DIY,removed,god shut the fuck up
DIY,removed,someone shit in your cheerios this morning you should reread what i wrote with a less hostile attitude before you reply
DIY,removed,you gave me a hard wood
DIY,removed,i have some local california hardwood right here he hehe i mean my penis
DIY,removed,thats awesome ive got two in my front yard and the smell has knocked me down all spring its like jizz used to lubricate a drill in a machine shop beautiful tree though
DIY,removed,i assume due to the nature of this post that you dont have a girlfriend if you ever want to have one just wear the shirts until they are toast and throw them away no one cares how many shows you have been to its weird to display them
DIY,removed,thats going to be my porn name manzanita bush
DIY,removed,highly illegal to cut down live manzanita
DIY,removed,that would certainly make my wood hard
DIY,removed,are there really trees that smell of jiz
DIY,removed,i would love to see of the asshats on reddit respond to this one i am pretty sure grammar nazis and reddit mods base their worth on being able to correct others seriously below rapist and child killer are reddit mod on the usefulness scale in lifeyou are a sad sad human do you tell your mom and your cats how you ban people from things on the internet seriously either you are plus and no one in the world will actually talk to you or you are younger than and no one else in the world will talk to you or you are insane

DIY,removed,
DIY,removed,he did fuck up bigtime by destroying the riparian area in his lake dear humans of earth stop dumping sand where it doesnt naturally occur shit like this is why lakes across north america are becoming algae infested cesspools healthy riparian areas filter the water healthy riparian areas healthy lakes op is killing his lake
DIY,removed,op is ruining his lake by doing this my province didnt have any buffer zones until around years ago and dozens of lakes are now algae infested cesspools because of it dear op when you destroy the riparian area you destroy the lakes natural filtration system you also kill plenty of wildlife which can lead to the total collapse of food chains in the lake
DIY,removed,fucking ridiculous that your state allows things like this in the riparian area this is how lakes die they need the riparian area to stay healthy it is an absolutely essential part of lake ecology a damned shame that people like you would rather dredge and dump sand than keep your lake healthy
DIY,removed,the jest of the comments was that the original setup in the end would only further heatup the room another version of the same required some number of metric tons of ice per day to be supplied to work right
DIY,removed,yeah he made an over engineered swamp cooler not nearly as bad as structurally destroying your property something like would have been much easier for him but whatever either way theyre temporary solutions since youre constantly having to refill the ice
DIY,removed,yeah i remember that anyone know what became of it
DIY,removed,or the bookwall guy
DIY,removed,how about doing a service and removing them to restore the embankment oh well youll be sorry in years when your property is worthless because the lake is full of algal blooms people in this sub i guess dont give a shit about the environment funny thing is it will bite them in the ass later on

DIY,removed,and then one day after another guy made the exact same flawed air conditioner having not read any of the comments this subreddit is a goldmine sometimes
DIY,removed,besides the fact that the tallest wall will fall over because the ground behind it will win in a few years it doesnt seem like he put any geotextile betweens his draining rocks and the sand on top i believed he said he alternated the layers of draining rocks and backfill in short this means the sand will seep through the rock all the way up to his drain pipe meaning he couldve just as well used the backfill and no draining rocks since the smallest grain decides draining capacities and not knowing the type of drain used the sand could clog up the drain pretty soon people dont clean out their drains nearly enough as needed so either the stuff will stay wet and rot and then fall over or before that the few bolts all the way at the bottom of the tall posts will snap and the back wall fall over time will tell
DIY,removed,i studied more than one broad while in europe giggaty

DIY,removed,she must be great in bed good for you fam
DIY,removed,you dont need gifts to look good to a woman you only need to please her tingles work out in the gym and be dominant in the bed works for every single girl ive fucked only overweight or scrawny weak men need to placate their women with gifts to compensate for their lackings
DIY,removed,i bet her actual boyfriend was very thankful he didnt have to get her anything while he banged her sorry bro
DIY,removed,no all yall is semantically identical to all of you which is a perfectly fine construction
DIY,removed,would love to see a series of pictures depicting that dont forget to show the finished product first
DIY,removed,he probably even got laid for doing this
DIY,removed,id like to see more kitty pictures plox
DIY,removed,only losers do long distance
DIY,removed,what better way to say to your long distance gf i obviously havent been cheating on you
DIY,removed,hate to break it to you but years long distance isnt a relationship at all
DIY,removed,did i ask for your opinion
DIY,removed,the dyson really finishes it off
DIY,removed,that catfish will love it
DIY,removed,i wonder how her short distance boyfriend likes it
DIY,removed,not to sound like a dick but a long distance relationship is basically of one
DIY,removed,its his long distance girl friend though probably showed this to some dude right before sucking his balls i hate to point out that it be like it be but it be
DIY,removed,isnt it an automaton and the plural or the art is automata
DIY,removed,her short distance boyfriend loves the craftsmanship
DIY,removed,how embarrassing all that work and you misspelled elizabeth
DIY,removed,shes cheating on yoi
DIY,removed,do you think shell put it in the closet when he other lovers come over

DIY,removed,i dont get it why did he namedrop a dumb vacuum so many times is this a dyson ad or something are you just really proud of your new vacuum you know dyson vacuums arent all that great when it actually comes to testing how well they work they are stupidly overpriced and absolutely made with planned obsolescence in mind
DIY,removed,that thing is gonna look sad by her bed when shes having sex with your local boyfriend
DIY,removed,i bet her boyfriend will love it
DIY,removed,his local girlfriend only got an amazon gift card
DIY,removed,i always thought the singular was automaton
DIY,removed,but we broke up before i could give it to her obo
DIY,removed,so she is homeless

DIY,removed,all these useless area posts makes me wish i had a useless area in my house
DIY,removed,i thought the title said mushroom and was really curious as to where this was going
DIY,removed,this is the first time ive heard the term mud room
DIY,removed,i first read this as mini murder room lol
DIY,removed,so thats what theyre called thanks op til
DIY,removed,arent dysons considered enormous wastes of money i have read many reviews saying they arent much better than the generic
DIY,removed,minus how much youre putting that dyson on a pedestal thumbs up to your reno in a year or two when you hate your broken dyson youll be wondering why you thought you liked it so much
DIY,removed,i created a mini murder room i was very confused
DIY,removed,hmm thats a neat placement for the dyson
DIY,removed,that vacuum sucks both literally and figuratively
DIY,removed,nice work but that sweeper being in every shot is driving me crazy for some reason heres my mudroom with wooden walls and my dyson heres my mudroom with a hot bench plus my dyson heres my mudroom with an added shelf and oh look theres my dyson
DIY,removed,what are your thoughts on that dyson
DIY,removed,nice try dyson rep
DIY,removed,wow that is an awesome build how are the temps generally that graphics card can run pretty hot
DIY,removed,like the plate on the truck crafted
DIY,removed,
DIY,removed,i dont see a pushpull configuration of fans here what are the temperatures at full load
DIY,removed,what kind of vacuum is that
DIY,removed,oh hey linus
DIY,removed,i read that too quick and thought it said mini murder room still this is a very nice space with nice stuff for any occasion
DIY,removed,til mudrooms are a thing
DIY,removed,i see someone fell for the dyson meme
DIY,removed,which was much much much too low the material cost was roughly so my profit margin was very low considering it took a solid week to build the desk
DIY,removed,what are temps air flow looks inefficient but there is really only one pic i can really see overall amazing build
DIY,removed,must be a pain to take to lans
DIY,removed,hey nice job linus from linus tech tips did the same thing
DIY,removed,hi there i followed your guide and made this desk computer way less cool than yours of course but in order to make this i had to sell my old desktop to have the funds but now my friends want to have a lan party at his house in weeks since this is the only computer i own and i dont have a truck i find it difficult to join my friend in his lan the party is very important to me and my friends since it is near graduation time and i had to skip the last party for personal reasons any tips for moving my deskcomputer would be appreciated
DIY,removed,what makemodel is that monitor mount
DIY,removed,you forgot the s never forget the s

DIY,removed,whats cribbage
DIY,removed,hmm based on your long posthistory of ridiculing peoples intelligence gleefully celebrating strangers misfortunes instanceuponinstance of childish namecalling and generally just behaving like a very unhappy and nasty human being you really do seem to be suffering from some rather tremendous character and logic flaws i was following the below conversation until you tucked tail spouted off some nonsense ran and deleted your comment history despite whatever the excuse however what follows is an excellent chance to inspire some of us to perhaps overcome our own powerful cognitive dissonance by abandoning the silly attempts at preserving your online ego and instead allowing new information to change your mind after all several of us are genuinely interested in how to deal with those who run from evidence to any contrary rather than simply reassess and redefine themselves and associated thought processes accordingly or is ignorance altogether a foreign affair and as such is reserved only for weak people liberals with whom you so gleefully and spitefully disagree step up
DIY,removed,cribbage gives me gas

DIY,removed,full waterproofing is a relatively new concept in shower design and building for years people have been doing it just the way you did with duroc thinset and tile without issue if you had said greenboard and mastic then that could have been another discussion gypsum wallboard soaks up water and holds it expanding and making a breeding ground for mold and making your mortar bed unstable thinset and duroc are permeable and wick water so although your concrete board may get wet from time to time it should wick the water and dry without any major concern its definitely a good idea to run your bath exhaust fan during and for minutes after your showers to eliminate residual steam and make the least humid environment in your bathroom possible dont feel bad i had the same semipanic attack at the same time when i was finishing my first bathroom but after a lot of digging this is the conclusion that seemed to keep popping up but as a disclaimer im a lowly do it yourselfer as well so it may be worth your piece of mind to fact check with google
DIY,removed,can you maybe just take showers without water
DIY,removed,rtifu
DIY,removed,there should be but only if you make frippets underneath it skip to for the frippet part

DIY,removed,itt op will not take good advice

DIY,removed,umm dur you responded to umadamekir who explained to your redneck ass that is not a lot of money when one is building a chicken coop out of bought lumber for pets he was obviously talking about cost not ethics you might have noticed that umadamekir was kind of more concerned about having chickens in a nice yard estetics seemed to be the concern not ethics you respond with well i can make pens that fairly obviously wouldnt meet umadamkirs estetic requirements for less money who cares its irrelevant to the entire thread op built a fancy chicken coop for his pets that live in an urban area did you miss all the houses in his pictures at what point do you really think its relevant what people do in the country and what they spend to get their eggs and meat ah right the whole time you were arguing costs you really meant ethics because somehow the cost of the pen is somehow correlated to ethics of raising the chickens sorry my bad im the retard ah yeah but ethics

DIY,removed,but that doesnt explain why i shouldnt be upset they still want credit after everyone and their mom has sought credit here its one thing to hold something because of your hobby but then why brandish it here after so so so so so many people have thats where i get particularly hung up its the same as in the rart sub youre it supposed to criticize artwork there if it is extremely common and unoriginal youll usually see something like no art is original or id like to see you do better well the point is i dont care if you are creating unoriginal crap because you want to proactive or whatever but dont expect everyone to jump in and sip your kool aid if this is the time ive seen your stupid ass robin williams charcoal piece with your fucking row of pencils sitting off to the side of the photo

DIY,removed,i heard if it flys floats or fucks its cheaper to rent
DIY,removed,is that actually the official explanation or did you just make it up they used parsec in the same context in
DIY,removed,i actually prefer the explanation that whoever wrote that particular line didnt really know wtf a parsec was and since it has the word sec in it he thought it was probably a unit of time and he meant to go look it up in the dictionary but it wasnt handy and he had to go let the dog out and make dinner for his kids and he just plain forgot to check out that super tiny detail that he had no way of knowing would go on to become a grain of sand in the foreskin of millions of space nerd star wars geeks who would obsessively rewatch the movie on technology that wasnt even close to being a reality yet picking it apart and dissecting every line and who would go on to make up bullshit to explain how every little mistake was actually intentional andor foreshadowing for movies that would come out almost years later

DIY,removed,too cheap to bring the avionics to an avionics shop and have it done right instead of using materials that meet the standards determined by the faa stuff that wont burn or break you can just cheaply shove some flammable plastic and install a switch with over amps flowing through it into your panel and call it a day i appreciate your diy attitude and diy is a great way to get lots of things done for yourself if you have the know how and skill which this would would obviously apply if you were building a computer case or something else which doesnt have strict regulations however you are not only endangering yourself you are potentially endangering your passengers this is entirely illegal and while it may seem harmless you need to have a local avionics shop fabricate you a proper cover plate and give you the proper log book entries to make this legal if you want to build things for your aircraft you need to enter into the experimental market and purchase a non certified aircraft which doesnt have these regulations our become a certified faa repair station i hope you take the n down as well it is sharing information about someone to the public and also a violation to reddit

DIY,removed,putting the finished product at the top is stupid and i hate it why do people think this is a good idea i want to take the journey and be rewarded with the reveal at the end
DIY,removed,people still have dog houses poor dog
DIY,removed,this is a bar in someones house quite sad actually glad to see they can still function enough to do any kind of renovation
DIY,removed,yippie i took a dump yesterday
DIY,removed,all instructions are here or you can oreder some readymade stuff from website
DIY,removed,rrapevan
DIY,removed,that is by far the nicest looking rape van i have ever seen
DIY,removed,adventuremobile sounds like you offer free candy inside
DIY,removed,it is an adventure van if the adventure is rape
DIY,removed,as a person with no time not enough money and kids you have my upvote
DIY,removed,no kids key to success lmao
DIY,removed,mirin vascularity
DIY,removed,i have all these things but a fulltime job and no useful skills makes me want to learn though incredibly cool
DIY,removed,you said adventure mobile here you go
DIY,removed,implying that you cant have sex unless youre in a bed
DIY,removed,roses are red violets are blue i have a gun get in the adventuremobile
DIY,removed,but a bed offers comfort when youre out roughing it or when youre in roughing it since the subject of sex already was mentioned
DIY,removed,great forearms
DIY,removed,the one thing he has that supercedes all the others you cite is skills
DIY,removed,typical european attitude you cant do anything yourself so dont bother trying leave it to the experts who are blokes like yourself with a couple of tools no wonder you all embrace socialism helpless as weak kittens in america if you want to design and build your own airplane the faa is all good with that in fact every year a million people come to oshkosh wisconsin to celebrate homebuilding of airplanes aircraft something with a complexity times that of an auto or camper making your own camper thats some sort of dangerous pastime you guys are coddled too much
DIY,removed,a good friend of mine bought his first house just about a year ago and has since done a ton of renovations on it it has made me seriously rethink where i live since i really have little to no expectation to own here anytime soon and moving further away from work is not something i really want to do am considering a relocation in part because of projects like this
DIY,removed,this guy definitely fucks
DIY,removed,funny thing is i want to convert a van like this and came up with the same thought
DIY,removed,he might have put a lot of other important things on hold to complete this project he simply made it his priority
DIY,removed,man i could probably find a way around the time money and kids when i have them but i dont know the first fucking thing about buildingworking with any of this id probably blow myself up installing the propane tank
DIY,removed,envious not jealous
DIY,removed,it looks like a molestation cruise ship
DIY,removed,now all you need is a free wifi sign and some candy 😂
DIY,removed,you built an awesome bundymobile
DIY,removed,look at mr moneybags over here with his fancy rapevan
DIY,removed,i understand that but arguing that paid leave for a backpacking trip is the equivalent to parental leave is insane
DIY,removed,the west still doesnt make enough children to regenerate the population it makes a lot of sense to finance having child considering it is nearly always beneficial for society the methhead argument is stupid as hell
DIY,removed,he is wrong i dont think the guy he was replying to was implying that every child child is going to grow up to be a super successful doctor lawyer or what have you i dont think anyone would imply that just that having a child is going to a net benefit to society which is in almost all cases going to be true even if they turn out to be a dreg but then op decides to go on some edgy rant about consumerism and climate change as a means to justify his bitter feelings towards parents and their children
DIY,removed,if everybody calls a cat a dog that does not make it so
DIY,removed,or if you want to chat about vans sounds legit guys will there be free candy
DIY,removed,op totally needs to write free candy on the side bonus points if he hangs out next to a park with it
DIY,removed,life is not one big pleasure parade i still have fun as a parent but i put my kid first this is my choice
DIY,removed,time money youth and skills
DIY,removed,
DIY,removed,anyone wanna buy my van
DIY,removed,hes not wrong hes also not right the implication that its not worth having kids because they might be fuckups is idiotic
DIY,removed,white people spending thousands of dollars renovating a van with miles is the new black people putting thousands of dollars of rims on a car with miles yall going to be looking sweet waiting for the tow truck
DIY,removed,the pedo mobile thats disguised as a cool taxi fantastic
DIY,removed,soits a cool looking rape van
DIY,removed,i converted a van ok lets check if its attractive white people again yup
DIY,removed,the new rape mobile
DIY,removed,free candy van
DIY,removed,he was complaining people that have kids get paid leave and you dont get that benefit to say take care of old people what he didnt realize if he is in the us is that you actually do get paid for stuff like taking care of the elderly through fmla the place is dumb if you dont want to have kids that is fine no use in complaining about people that do sure some kids will grow up to be spectacular and some be a drain on society but the majority of them will become average just like the person making that post
DIY,removed,hey kids want to go on an adventure with me
DIY,removed,well nobody forced you to have kids
DIY,removed,umm why cover up the windows are we going to see this van on the new attached to an amber alert
DIY,removed,oh boy i bet all the girls love your adventuremobile
DIY,removed,rape van level great job though get a carbon monoxide detector in there too
DIY,removed,this whole thread and no one mentions that you made a rape van not one rape van joke for shame reddit
DIY,removed,freecandymobile
DIY,removed,holy cow this blew up overnight the entire project set me back about van hightop including installation all conversion costs tools supplies wood solar electrical propane

DIY,removed,the nsa doesnt patrol the border looking for weed in your trunk they tap into your computerphone
DIY,removed,not gonna lie halfway through the pictures i half expected this to turn into a kidnapper van
DIY,removed,missing a sign on the back not a rape van
DIY,removed,thats a nice rape van you went and made for yourself
DIY,removed,nice rape wagon lol that high top roof is awesome
DIY,removed,you misspelled rape van
DIY,removed,looks great just need a nice removable free candy sign and youre ready for some schoolyarder i mean weekend adventures

DIY,removed,the van looks awesome all thats missing now is the free candy sign
DIY,removed,no one picked up the fact that when youre really happy the wooden penis on the side comes out erected
DIY,removed,if i wanted i could match even a piece of wood with a girl ut instead you humans think drawing fish net ladies with cucumbers on the side is an impressive way to get a girl wow have some afterthought period no period
DIY,removed,happiness is obviusly measured by the length of your dick that why the koreans awwwnt to nuke america so bad and they will thi saugust or novemerr or
DIY,removed,goodjob bro must be nice thinking you made a differcen well actually you did you made her standards on par with a box of chocolats must be nicee thinking thts the most she thinks of you peace

DIY,removed,came to talk about our pocket sliding door locking solution we came to the opinion that the common hook method is lame and with time the house shifts and no longer latches in resolve we went with a force electromagnetic locking solution connected to a switch inside the bathroom people say what if some one leave the emag power on walks out closes the door after about of student housing weve found it to not be a problem and in worse case scenario flipping the breaker switch grants passage it adds to the appeal of the modern house experience and people overall seem to like it
DIY,removed,wrong op said it was a barn

DIY,removed,selecting inferior males and having children late works for the most part in a traditional society but ever since the sexual revolution where genetics matter more women are at fault for having children late or picking lesser males to be impregnated by obviously society had to go through a transitional period for the theory of weeding out betaslesser males unfortunately lesser males can never truly be weeded out because women will keep having male children well past which means their genetics will be of lower than average quality its really just better to have a traditional society thats one of the things that makes me so mad women demand to live by jungle law sexual morality yet dont benefit enough from it to evolve humanity they just waste away in lust if they actually got impregnated by chadssuperior males in their then we would actually be evolving then if they never got pregnant past we would not bring in genetic degeneration which would also serve as population control

DIY,removed,the search started on craigslist for a vintage or whatever speed really mixte or traditional diamond frame peugeot motobecane raleigh bianchi or something japanese of course we didnt find anything we liked if we found something with good components it would have to be repainted or if the color was good the rest of the bike needed a total overhaul or it wasnt the right size and so on there was really nothing out there so i decided to just build one to her specifications what a load of crap lol its a bike
DIY,removed,no it would be like someone saying i couldnt find a hot rod i wanted to work on so i built one

DIY,removed,this is so rad your kids are totally gonna smoke weed and get laid in that treehouse when theyre older this treehouse will be the gift that ages with them tear
DIY,removed,diy cuckshed
DIY,removed,i know nothing of tree houses i know nothing of carpentry i just came here to see this guy get slaughtered by the you did this wrong diy mafia very disappointed by the way looks very fun good job
DIY,removed,where the hell do you live where furring costs you a dollar a strip your being ripped off you cant use furing for anything other than hanging siding you should burn it as kindling and kill the rest of your limited brain cells
DIY,removed,thats what she said i am a bot that uses a httpsenwikipediaorgwikinaivebayesclassifier to detect thats what she said jokes reply with info to get more information
DIY,removed,dont forget to bring a trowel iswydt
DIY,removed,no no no you put the finished pic first
DIY,removed,reminds me of nougat
DIY,removed,its dolomite baby
DIY,removed,just tap it in just taaaaap it in
DIY,removed,thats what she said i am a bot that uses a httpsenwikipediaorgwikinaivebayesclassifier to detect thats what she said jokes reply with info to get more information please read info before downvoting
DIY,removed,no milk
DIY,removed,finish picture first why is this so hard
DIY,removed,concrete is going to be an affordable option and the most diy option besides butcher block concrete is relatively soft compared to granitequartz it also stains more easily than granite and quartz it is more like using marble i would highly recommend a quartz countertop as its the most durable and doesnt require sealing it has tons of color options but costs a bit more we recently redid our kitchen with ella by cambria if you know a contractor you may get a discount as we got off through my uncle on his preferred customer account he orders a couple counter tops a year from them
DIY,removed,i wish people would put the final product picture first so that i can see that it looks ugly and dont need to keep scrolling
DIY,removed,just tap it in give it a little tap tappy a little tap tap taparoo
DIY,removed,i made a poop today
DIY,removed,finished product first
DIY,removed,no finished product is anyone else itchy all over
DIY,removed,i think he would notice his dad crawling into bed with him hello
DIY,removed,if i was op i wouldnt be such a cunt to my neighbors and construct an expensive and pointless eyesore
DIY,removed,because op is a selfish douchebag
DIY,removed,im upvoting this for not putting the finished product first
DIY,removed,in many countries there is a legal principle that is roughly as follows a landowner is entitled to use hisher property in such a way that maximizes hisher enjoyment however the enjoyment must not unreasonably interfere or disturb the rights of adjoining landholders or create a private nuisance thus a landowner can use hisher property according to hisher will upon the condition that such use will not disturb or injure any adjoining landowner the legal principle very much hinges on context for one id hate to be the rightside neighbour where rain runoff is going to flow into the yard a big eyesore like that can also shade out neighbouring gardens and kill peoples plants hopefully op has given these things some thought i agree that its an ugly eyesore though
DIY,removed,its ugly its expensive it will cause water to run into your neighbours yard it will cause a big shade patch in other yards nyc may have approved it god knows why but your neighbours can lodge legal complaints if it starts inflicting up the enjoyment of their properties
DIY,removed,you rarely have a legal right to do whatever you want with your property a landowner is entitled to use hisher property in such a way that maximizes hisher enjoyment however the enjoyment must not unreasonably interfere or disturb the rights of adjoining landholders or create a private nuisance thus a landowner can use hisher property according to hisher will upon the condition that such use will not disturb or injure any adjoining landowner
DIY,removed,pretty sure the neighbours can still issue a legal complaint if it impacts on their property which it absolutely will by creating shade good luck having a garden next door water run off and glare approval from a city or council doesnt nullify private complaints

DIY,removed,whats a tsum tsum
DIY,removed,its the most brazen transparent cash grab by disney to date they are collectibles that do literally nothing they are in the likeness of disney marvel and star wars characters but highly stylized in a cuteminimalist way the minimalism keeps productions costs low but the cute helps maintain a retail price that it disproportionate to cost its just another way for disney to exploit peoples emotions and separate them from their cash offering nothing of value in return
DIY,removed,
DIY,removed,neat but no final product first in the build set made me automatically dislike the post because i had no idea what the hell it was i thought you were building a giant mickey mouse head the whole time still a good build
DIY,removed,my year old niece loves tsum tsumare you a year old boy op
DIY,removed,did anyone else notice the ring on ops finger in the ninth frame either op is a pimp or he misspelled wife either way i learns what a tsum tsum is thanks for the random knowledge
DIY,removed,whats so difficult about posting the finished product first its like half the diy posts ive seen recently just dont even bother anymore
DIY,removed,rock and mineral shops just bring all the stuff that you cant find locallyeasily if you want amber or petrified wood but dont have any around you then you can go to a mineral store and find them

DIY,removed,good im not alone
DIY,removed,youre the top comment lotta responsibility that comes with that namely keeping me from having to scroll down any further than this so the fucks a tsum tsum
DIY,removed,i did the same and then came here to make this comment

DIY,removed,what does your wife think of your gift to your girlfriend
DIY,removed,right i wonder what he built for his wife take a closer look at the first pic
DIY,removed,this is an ad

DIY,removed,of all the diy posts to break the cardinal rule and not start with finished product this one has to be the worst wtf is a tsum tsum and how is that meant to hold them i dont want to scroll all the way to the bottom before i figure that out
DIY,removed,you called her a girlfriend but are wearing a wedding ring in the pictures good work by the way wish i could be that handy
DIY,removed,same
DIY,removed,would have saved me the clicks if the final piece first rule was adhered to
DIY,removed,im still wondering what it is finished wasnt on top
DIY,removed,thats what you guys are wondering nobody noticed that this guy is wearing a wedding ring while making something for his girlfriend
DIY,removed,plus if you get caught mid construction a stop work order is made and you get a fine every time we see more work going on and then you are on the radar of the building department who usually does zoning enforcement as well so any time your grass is over inches you get a notice and order man how i love catching people amd shitting all over them when i do

DIY,removed,i dont see why the buyer would have to sign anything liens like other real estate encumbrances run with the land subsequent owners are bound whether they agree or not
DIY,removed,land dont need to be watered in a large portion of the country surely youre aware of rain right
DIY,removed,cacti are vulnerable to frost damage particularly the young growing tips thats why you sometimes see styrofoam cups on cactus like this httpsislimgvetttyjpg
DIY,removed,artificial grass has come a long way and a lot of it looks really good but it is extremely expensive a decent quality installation for square feet would cost around
DIY,removed,op basically posted his home address online
DIY,removed,congrats on adding to the carbon footprint and potentially reducing the resale value of your property now instead of plants releasing oxygen and moisture you have rocks retaining and emitting the suns energy might have well used concrete or asphalt
DIY,removed,yep agree desert landscaping is ugly af and makes a home feel barren that beautiful green lawn he had in the beginning just looks and feels nice if you wanna save water get the farmers to be more efficient dont punish homeowners into making their neighborhoods ugly this is pointless and ugly and dumb goddamn do i hate desert landscaping

DIY,removed,httpsiimgurcompnsssajjpg it really is matt down there
DIY,removed,if people didnt want hoas they wouldnt exist or perhaps more accurately people prefer the benefits associated with hoas more than they dislike the disadvantages
DIY,removed,ive lived in the west until i went to college farther east one day i realized there werent any sprinklers anywhere on the lush campus
DIY,removed,i dont doubt for a second that there are onerous intermeddling hoas but thats really more of a problem with the rules and those selected to enforce them an hoa can also have be run more reasonably im sympathetic to those who want to be free from the oversight of yet another body when i built my house recently i built it in an area with no hoa which was no easy task in the phoenix area but i also built in an area with neighbors who take pride in their properties in another neighborhood i would have wanted an hoa to protect me
DIY,removed,youre not required to do anything if you dont join their group
DIY,removed,sure sometimes neighborhoods go bad but sometimes they get better and sometimes they oscillate between thats the risk you take of course you take risk in joining an hoa its just a different sort of risk enforcement risk cost risk rule change risk etc
DIY,removed,indio ca it looks ridiculous on google streetview and then those place names palm desert while there are greenbrown lawns everywhere such a waste
DIY,removed,thanks
DIY,removed,why wouldnt it be fair you choose to buy a house in an hoa and if you think your hoa fee isnt being used properly you should request your hoa budget and accounting documents to see whats happening to your money

DIY,removed,yeah i never understood the person who buys an american flag made in chinathere is a special place in sweatshop hell waiting for them
DIY,removed,ladies and gents this is what wealthy privilege look like the only ppl i ever see talk about how free trade gives poor and world workers jobs are the priviledged fucks who benefit from outsourcing you dont have to be a nationalist to oppose outsourcing and favor protectionist you just have to be raised working class as someone who saw my dads good paying union job get outsourced to china i know from experience filthy priviledged capitalist pigs like yourself are going to the guillotine when the workers raise
DIY,removed,you seem fun
DIY,removed,its not about the individual the game is international economic competition and just like inside a particular country every dollar you spend is a point for whoever you give it to and the working conditions in china are never ok
DIY,removed,the quality of the item is shittier thats the problem americans used to make products that lasted for life yeah the item is cheaper but you buy it five times over your lifespan because its made terribly
DIY,removed,in the case of a flag theres a lot going on symbolismwise youre advertising your love of your country with something imported the american flag is supposed to represent freedom but the worker that made it is not experiencing much freedom i guess a chinese sweatshop american flag does represent freemarket capitalism
DIY,removed,no he is too
DIY,removed,this sub isnt for advertising your shop
DIY,removed,i sell em for my guess on shipping is

DIY,removed,i love meat too its goddamned delicious and the smell of frying bacon triggers something primal for sure what i dont love is the fucking horrible lives the animals live that grow the meat for every bit of meat in the shops there existed a consciousness that went through some real fucking brutal suffering the problem isnt that it died the problem was its conditions while it was alive i respect your decision to eat meat except i bet it isnt your decision i bet you eat it because everyone else does because you grew up in a family whos parents fed it to you and ate it themselves and whos society as a whole does imagine two hundred years ago in america do you have slaves well yes everyone does its just what we do
DIY,removed,u put a pillow over her head

DIY,removed,whats not diy about it did a factory make these chairs no he did did he use pro tools to do it sure but you and me can get a hold of the dame tools or reasonable substitutes easily its it better to have a literal step by step of making something by a pro than someone just slapdash tossing something together poorly dont the amateur s get roasted in tbis exact subreddit all the time by pros

DIY,removed,so for the sake of this story lets say my little brother is john were and respectively and living in the same house as our parents about a week ago i was in my room getting dressed after getting out of the shower when john barged in i dont even remember what he came in for i just know i covered my breasts and told him to get out for a minute he just stood there staring me up and down eventually he realized i told him to leave and he ran out i was for certain that he saw everything and i was mortified when i came out of my room he was waiting nearby john started apologizing to me frantically for how he acted he said he had never seen a woman naked before so he was taken aback when he saw i wasnt dressed he was always so innocent before that i started to feel guilty for causing him to see me i only felt worse when he said he was slightly turned on by my naked body at this point i just left because this was all starting to confuse me later on i came to the realization that he was probably just curious about sex after what happened the following morning after our parents left for work i went to his room to talk with him about this when i told john not to feel guilty for being curious he was immediately relieved from this point on though im not sure if i made the right call i asked john if he wanted to try doing things with me he was surprised by the question but he agreed remarkably fast from that morning on weve been having sex in his room at least once a day what im worried about is that if i might be hurting him by letting him experiment with me even if i started this hoping the opposite would happen do you guys think this is a healthy relationship will this be helpful or harmful to him one way or the other let me know in the comments thanks in advance

DIY,removed,im originally from the uk lived in a few countries abroad and have freinds from all around the world ranging from those who literally came from third world hut towns to the superrich as a college student i work part time as a cashier in a place that has a lot of visitors from abroad the worst customers i have are almost always middle aged british people i didnt realise it when i lived in the uk but theres a lot of people who are so pent up with a simmering anger and animosity towards one another i grew up in a village and spent a lot of time central london so tbh i never really experienced it that much its mostly southerners living in the suburbs anyways these people are always the worst its kinda hard to explain but they have this sort superiority complex towards foreigners and other brits those they view as equal or above them they feel they need to compete with them and will happily stab you in the back its sort of keeping up with the joneses but its intertwined with classism theyll try to catch you out on the slightest mistake or perceived provocation theyll then become super uptight lock their body use a tense and condescending voice to show extreme anger without actually going so far as to shouting or lose composure theyll try to tear you down out of a perverse pleasure from putting you in your place as to affirm their own position as above you they abuse the customer is always right to get an edge over you and ask to see someone they see as more worthy talking to asap like a manager

DIY,removed,as a serial entrepreneur i wanted to leave a note here to encourage you talented folks to make yourselves available for a very popular new trend of retro arcade bars i just visited one in providnce ri called shelter the concept is pretty simple old arcade games attract young adult gamers sell those guys some beer while they are here many games are hard to get so perhaps you can reach out to these folks to see if there is something they are having a hard time locating and you can simply build it for them for a fair and profitable margin of coure reach out if you need help

DIY,removed,now do it again with iron
DIY,removed,dude what do you mean its not perfect i literally have your setup but speakers bigger mousepad how big is your desk
DIY,removed,now that youve leveled up your blacksmithing i would recommend investing in the dwarven crafting perk
DIY,removed,i have no idea why youve been downvoted youre absolutely right isolating speakers will improve their performance its most noticeable on highend speaker setups obviously but isolating them from a desktop will also boost sound quality by removing the sympathetic resonance of the desk the isoacoustics may be a bit pricey for some people a cheaper option is the auralex mopads might not work quite as well but theyre half the price
DIY,removed,dude you need to get a life

DIY,removed,he wasnt wrong and even if he was theres no need for such a pretentious condescending tone dick move
DIY,removed,its funny that instead of being a parent and teaching your kids not to fuck with the litter boxes you just decided itd be easier to make a lock box for them instead also that transgender comment at the end i am glad you are comparing transgender bathrooms to litter boxes because those kinds of people really are literally animals
DIY,removed,id suggest just beating the piss out of your kid until they learn not to behave like fucking douches
DIY,removed,for parents who have cats
DIY,removed,dont even get me started on my cumbox
DIY,removed,its called parenting perhaps the op has never heard of it
DIY,removed,i dont really care but thanks for contributing to the discussion
DIY,removed,please throw your horrible transgender joke in there with the rest of the shit i hope you dont talk like that around your son
DIY,removed,i just let my cats crap on the floor and the robot hoover gets most if not all of the particles
DIY,removed,have you considered that your kid trying to eat cat shit is maybe natural selections way of telling you your kid is retarded
DIY,removed,fyi getting your tubes tied doesnt make you transgendered you just triggered me thanks
DIY,removed,do you like that you fucking retard
DIY,removed,downvote for trying to make some sort of creepy glbt issue out of a cat getting spayedneutered seriously keep your political issues and other life crap out of the cats life they dont give shits about your leanings and nor do most people

DIY,removed,your pants are too tight you look like peter pan
DIY,removed,omg why the tight pants 😲
DIY,removed,or a penis
DIY,removed,who made the rule to post the finished product first i think its better to post it last meh
DIY,removed,my god there is a mimic in your backyard
DIY,removed,can someone start an askdiy or diyhelp subreddit it seems now whenever i scroll trough the posts its just people asking questions about how to do something i liked it more when it was actual diy builds i understand there are still some it just seems the ratio as greatly decreased recently
DIY,removed,yes
DIY,removed,i love velcro i can be unbelievable strong and durable we used properly it can also be hidden from view
DIY,removed,thats why im asking
DIY,removed,has their shower sex improved
DIY,removed,um no really you come on diy and your initial comment to op questions their project and there motives this is a forum for providing assistance and asking questions that may help assist op it is not a place to dissuade people from persuing valid projects that arent of your taste
DIY,removed,
DIY,removed,with all due respect that entire room is hideous
DIY,removed,why stop there the walls are begging for it
DIY,removed,you need an upright lamp in the middle of the floor
DIY,removed,can you pipe in lionel richie
DIY,removed,this room looks like an avocado
DIY,removed,
DIY,removed,this would be even cooler if you went all out with the concept and installed a light bulb on the floor and glued furniture to the ceiling
DIY,removed,
DIY,removed,
DIY,removed,you expecting lionel ritchie to stop by joking aside it looks nice
DIY,removed,
DIY,removed,rdiwhy
DIY,removed,
DIY,removed,you buy a bunch of flooring and then wave a wand while saying a spell and the floor floats up its pretty cool and great if you have a room with high ceilings you may have seen the advertisements double your living space with this easy tip on the side of facebook
DIY,removed,rmadlads
DIY,removed,op has gone into defense mode
DIY,removed,most people dont let their dogs piss in the house thats not normal dude
DIY,removed,pretty sure op glued a ladder to a carpet ceiling
DIY,removed,rdiwhy
DIY,removed,this is absolute gold as a real estate pro this is why i love reddit diy fucking gold reminds me of the person who made a backsplash what was a painting of a tile backsplash of one of the hundreds of decks that get posted with something crazy like screw holding up a railing you do know that home depot and lowes have resources for how to use their products right and its free also there is this great website out there called youtube you can search for things like how to make a knock down ceiling etc you could have created a proper knock down ceiling in under an hour or if you want to be creative you can put in a fancy swirl pattern lots of cool videos on youtube on making ceiling patterns if you had the energy and wanted to get creative i would have suggested a fancy ceiling texture or pattern one of many examples httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvtiugkemea best of all if you mess up just start over like making a design on a chalkboard and people will be amazed at the artwork not say wtf then the see a floor on the ceiling
DIY,removed,so much salt in this thread
DIY,removed,this reminds of the guy who covered his walls and ceiling with books it was hard work it looked sort of good and it was plain stupid but hey anything to get attention from reddit
DIY,removed,have had it installed in my houseand my rental for a few years now no problems still perfectly level and that is with training puppies so accident did happen i also live in an area very humid in the summer and dry in winter so its not that pretty sure whatever problems you are having is either due to poor installation or more dog piss then you are letting onto the rental shows no issues either and i just had tenants leave so we did a full inspection and everything is near perfect still though a bit more wear around the door then i would have expected in the rental as mine is still just fine
DIY,removed,i cannot believe the amount of shit people are giving you and how they think that their opinion on your room is anyway useful sure like if you were a rude house guest or my mother say its not the color i would have picked but you did a good job and move the fuck on the homeowner is honestly the only thing that matters in this situation fuck every single other person youll be the one waking up to it every day who gives two half shits if every living soul thinks its god awful ugly which it isnt if you like it let it ride
DIY,removed,read ops other responses in this thread hes being an aggressive douchebag to anyone saying anything remotely critical of his design choices not sure if offended is exactly the right word for it but hes definitely not responding kindly to criticism
DIY,removed,rdiwhy
DIY,removed,but it would look so good s
DIY,removed,with a slight chance of golden shower
DIY,removed,
DIY,removed,oh what a feeling
DIY,removed,thats the ugliest room ive ever seen and it makes me want to see more of your house lol
DIY,removed,another what not to do in rdiy thanks op
DIY,removed,then you may need to understand what context is because that was the exact thing i was explicitly talking about in my post if you replied to it and were staying on point with your comment then thats what you were talking about too if you wanted to talk about something other than what you were replying to then please use the proper words to indicate that
DIY,removed,more like diwhy amirite sigh im so alone
DIY,removed,swiff
DIY,removed,its rdiy redditors come here not only for the projects in the op but to read and contribute to the ensuing discussion about what op could have done differently next time you could try posting to rpraiseop instead
DIY,removed,that is by far the ugliest fucking wall colors i have ever seen the ceiling isnt bad but looks like shit because of the wall color you have bad taste i am sorry but someone has to say it
DIY,removed,what is happening here
DIY,removed,im almost afraid to scroll down and read all the reasons why this is a terrible ideais going to ruin your housewhatever because it looks super cool out of curiosity what gave you the idea to do that great work op
DIY,removed,oh no better not do something they like because itll cost a few hundred bucks and a hours of work my god is rdiy always this bad
DIY,removed,lalalalalalalalalalalala i cant hear you
DIY,removed,if you think that saying you dont like something is equivalent to hate you must have a real hard time in your life
DIY,removed,downvoted those stripes are fucking hideous at least the weird ceiling distracts from them
DIY,removed,maybe the guy with the blue shredded tire yard should have used this response
DIY,removed,the joke your head

DIY,removed,i just want to point out that ive noticed a large increase in criticism surrounding the comments in diy submissions and i feel that is the only appropriate place to express this issue specifically im referring the recent submission that had to have the comment section locked i saw it as a horrifying display of misinformation that resulted in unwarranted criticism because one or two armchair experts felt some urge to be a critic without a cause a i have a pretty good grasp on pharmacodynamics and toxicology i understand the language used in research papers and having the mulch he used in his backyard is very very unlikely to have a negative health impact on his family most of the sources people had offered to back their negative claims were popscience clickbait articles put out to make money off the ad revenues that comes from putting out fear mongering material and in that capacity it generated a large amount of negative feedback b i researched the rubber mulch he used and it is epa approved ada compliant nontoxic and ipema certified its important to note that achieving epa approval ada compliance and ipema certification is a very difficult thing to accomplish all of these entities work independently of each other and have very strict and in depth compliance standards meaning the mulch he used is extremely unlikely to cause any harm below are some relevant peerreviewed excerpts from well respected scientific research publishers taken together it appears that the health risk posed by tire rubber crumb used in both outdoor and indoor artificial turf fields to professional athletes and occasional users through inhalation is insignificant health risk evaluation results indicated that elevated health risk from inhalation exposure could occur only for workers installing artificial turf in small and poorly ventilated facilities with a long exposure history years source conclusion from environ sci technol − and published in the journal of the american chemical society for refrence here is the papers doi claims of toxicity are based on extreme laboratory testing such as the use of solvents and high temperatures to generate pollutants i took some time to review that specific report and it absolutely astonishing the unnatural temperatures and chemicals needed to generate any type of toxic pollutant from rubber mulch the ehhi report is comparable to the satirical the onion article new research shows that repeatedly stabbing monkeys with knives is bad for their health source synthetic turf health debate takes root published in the journal of environmental health perspectives and indexed as – link to this study thankfully no paywall blocking this article as for the concerns surrounding the supposed claims that it easily catches on fire i find incredibly misleading because standard organic mulch presents a higher risk of combustion especially in dry climates and the chemicals mulch is treated with also result in toxic fumes when burned as well to combust rubber mulch takes serious intent and effort to do so you essentially have to get a lighter and hold it to the mulch for a good or sustained minutes there are those saying that the river rock he gave away were in some way expensive this is absolutely incorrect river rock purchased in bulk is typically the pricing examples provided in that thread were from fancy overpriced gloss finished rocks not offered in bulk and meant to be used as a decoration for much smaller projects nobody offered personal advice and as somebody also using rubber mulch simply buying and setting up a cheap yard sprinkler to go off every couple of hours during hot sunny days dramatically cools the rubber as well cleans dirt and sand off of it it also does not displace or cause the washing away of the actual mulch this advice could have kept his yard from becoming a mucky mix of brown from sand and dirt accumulation nobody bothered to offer advice for creating a simple drainage system by altering the elevation around the edge of the perimeter to create a sort of canal so runoff does not accumulate and keeping the middle path at slightly elevated level the project he accomplished is outstanding and its terribly sad to see the effects of people bandwagoning around information that was entirely misinformed it is not the critic who counts not the man who points out how the strong man stumbles or where the doer of deeds could have done them better the credit belongs to the man who is actually in the arena whose face is marred by dust and sweat and blood who strives valiantly who errs who comes short again and again because there is no effort without error and shortcoming but who does actually strive to do the deeds who knows great enthusiasms the great devotions who spends himself in a worthy cause who at the best knows in the end the triumph of high achievement and who at the worst if he fails at least fails while daring greatly so that his place shall never be with those cold and timid souls who neither know victory nor defeat in conclusion my question is how do i continue to participate in a community that does not offer advice and instead criticizes and belittles those that take the chance to do something themselves
DIY,removed,why is everyone sat on heisenbergs face
DIY,removed,thats actually the pm i sent to the op first only difference is that i reworded it a little to be directed towards the community

DIY,removed,this is a pretty simple job if you have some help and take your time to shore it up properly before you remove the beam the sump needs to be re routed first to get the moisture away from the house you could at that point just replace with a pressure treated post or remove the old footing and build a tallerwider footing that keeps the soil and moisture away if you do that youll have to follow your local building code and possibly pull a permit once you know what code to follow you can usually find the residential builders code book at the library it will tell you exactly how to do it what kind dirt or gravel you have to use etc i bought the book at the link below to help me when the code doesnt explain it properly id recommend every diyer have this book

DIY,removed,fail
DIY,removed,are you okay i never said whether it was real or not its kind of irrelevant the point is the video has definitely been edited and thats what i was speaking to you need to calm down
DIY,removed,i mean just go back and read your comment you were definitely riled up anyways my comment was indeed pointless but not any more so than any other comment on reddit the purpose of my comment was that i felt you were unfairly lambasting people for doubting him when the video appears to have been edited and they did not have access to what you are now posting at least im pretty sure the github which you say is up now was not there originally because several people were asking for it
DIY,removed,are there more mirror shots with your em assistant

DIY,removed,iously no girl has ever dreamed of that monstrosity when they were growing up she probably hates it but doesnt want to offend you is that your job to fulfil the childhood dreams of a girl if so good luck with that bud a lazy excuse for your ineptitude is probably better represented by your shitty armchair comments rather than someone who actually went out and tried to do something
DIY,removed,how about you show us something worthwhile you have made with your own hands you are all over this thread taking every opportunity to shit all over ops work sure it isnt a masterpiece thats hardly the point yet you seem to take great pleasure in suggesting that ops abilities or lack thereof is a reflection of his poor character or lack of consideration for his fiancée what the fuck is wrong with you
DIY,removed,floating through space for billions of years literally a leftover building block of our solar system older than life itself makes a brilliant flaming entrance into earths atmosphere one day hacked and hammered into a piece of shit
DIY,removed,its not a true ring until yiu stick your dick through it
DIY,removed,for sure this ring is the shitty drawing that you pin to the fridge so your kid doesnt feel bad but you definitely wouldnt show it to anyone i hope ops wife cucks him
DIY,removed,honestly what a monumental prick if you felt the need and took the time to write something like that this morning especially in a thread like thisreally need to look in the mirror and reassess youre seemingly sad existence
DIY,removed,well said i cant imagine how embarrassed a woman must be that a guy would give her a thing like that its so lazy and poorly made there are so many easy ways op could have improved but he couldnt be bothered to give a fuck i hope she cucks him for this
DIY,removed,my ring is exposed to space every time i take a dump
DIY,removed,that wasnt meant to be a jab but even still
DIY,removed,oooh frontpage diy lets see whats fucked up yeah thats fucked up is anything ever done correctly on diy
DIY,removed,exactly hes basically ensuring that she bangs someone else op shes going to be emotionally dissatisfied with this and you know what shell fill that hole with a bigger stronger harder and more intense fuck than youll ever be capable of giving her
DIY,removed,your ring is bad and you should feel bad and youre a douchebag
DIY,removed,so i shouldnt use it for sex

DIY,removed,after opening the album i came to the comments just to down vote whoever said this

DIY,removed,thats a bombass gift wow hes going to explode when he sees that good job making the colors really pop no one said terrorism didnt have to look pretty you should have put a radio in it and turned it into a boom box tell him you love him so much it feels like your heart is going to burst this gift is sure to make a bang seems like your relationship is heating up how i learned to stop worrying and love the gift my girlfriend made me if you guys ever break up youll leave him in pieces ive heard of things being explosive in the bedroom but this is ridiculous tell him to cut the red wire to disarm it and cackle wildly as the colors change you really did a bangup job making this and so on and so forth

DIY,removed,i actually never interact with hookers so youll have to deal with that part oh and with all the cocaine and booze tell them to bring a comfy pillow instead of condoms
DIY,removed,thats chugglegigs in old money for those wondering
DIY,removed,given your inexperience have you considered buying a or led based light kit instead of working with mains voltage that way you have very los voltage in the light fitting another alternative would be to buy a presided inline cable and switch with a plug on one end that you would just need to connect into the light fitting the disadvantage of this is that you wouldnt have the switch mounted on the face of the behead
DIY,removed,includes dogs
DIY,removed,i really hope the deleted comments were people whining that option didnt post finished product first op you did great and thats definitely neat may have to tinker around with my led strips i bought a year ago

DIY,removed,from your statement in a now deleted comment common eye to the common eye steatoda grossa also colloquially known as the false black widow looks very similar to the latrodectus mactans the venomous black widow would you recommend just ignoring the differences in the words we use to describe them sure language does evolve but should we just throw convention out the window and anybody can make up any random bullshit word to describe what they want and everybody is supposed to accept that words have meaning for a reason and you or anyone else cant just say language evolves to explain away not using or misusing a very specific term to describe something the words came to be and do evolve over hundreds or thousand of years but it takes a long time and you cant just arbitrarily wave your hand and scream language evolves do wish away the accepted definition of a word that has been in use for a very very long time

DIY,removed,engineering student checking in
DIY,removed,ugh you should never skip leg day
DIY,removed,the balls are strong phrasing
DIY,removed,clearly we want the nsfw version
DIY,removed,my question is why would you post an image of just a skirt with no pants or leggings and not expect a comment of some sort of sexuality
DIY,removed,you cant even see the scars
DIY,removed,it makes your butt look big like infinite butt
DIY,removed,but boobs disturbing uncanny valley boobs
DIY,removed,youre kind of a dick
DIY,removed,worst part is shes asian senpai dont like
DIY,removed,an infinite hotdog down an infinite hallway

DIY,removed,rshittyhumanmods

DIY,removed,shut up neckbeard
DIY,removed,the ball magnets do not look like a welladjusted social human being but when i didnt see it in the future real mvp
DIY,removed,im pretty sure the blonde girl said it first then she opened her eyes really wide and kept them that way for the remaining minutes
DIY,removed,usexycyborg is such wife material sigh
DIY,removed,i never thought infinity could be flat maybe the flat earthers got a point
DIY,removed,i would like you to mobias strip for me
DIY,removed,theirs a joke here somewhere about how flat her ass is
DIY,removed,why you dont make an invisible skirt would befar more appreciated
DIY,removed,shucks did you even look at the first picture you can see everything
DIY,removed,the thumb is pure sex appeal the post wouldnt have gotten that popular without it i have no problem with that but if someones allowed to sell sex appeal then we should be allowed to comment on it i dont care either way as long as its consistent across the board
DIY,removed,lend some to op
DIY,removed,i can see so far up your skirt
DIY,removed,rwhiteknighting

DIY,removed,why is skeltal wearing a skirt
DIY,removed,dat ass tho
DIY,removed,her lack of ass is disgusting if shes not going to pretend to be professional about her posts i dont see why i should for her to try and be sexy about everything and then demands for us to focus on the project is literally just trolling

DIY,removed,questions how did you do that just to keep them blocky
DIY,removed,just make sure not to wear but are dealt with because to solder to magnets even the nickel plated kind
DIY,removed,i wonder how much more or less excited some of the commenters in here would be if they realised op is a transgender
DIY,removed,this cannot be truly disneyinspired unless there is a hidden phallus within a castle spire
DIY,removed,awww yay prenatal genderification
DIY,removed,do you have any idea what areolas are im talking about her fucking top you can see her nipples through it are you gonna say thats a park of the costume she didnt even have to record her upper body if she cant fucking dress if you pause the video and take a screenshot you can probably photoshop a perfect recreation of her topless because its so fucking tight and seethrough
DIY,removed,ill be in my bunk
DIY,removed,incoming
DIY,removed,why is nothing shaped like a penis
DIY,removed,cause babies do what they want even in the castle seems like made out of cake
DIY,removed,awesome now she can do cheap pantomime of the aristocracy in her overlycircumscribed gender role like a good future baby incubator wouldnt want her to dream of going to the stars curing diseases or improving the lot of her fellow humans she will have a plastic tiara to keep clean and sparkly after all you must be proud
DIY,removed,im sure she will grow up hoping to be a princess and you will get murdered by a feminist
DIY,removed,lets just put it this way if a fat dude had made this post it would have approximately points

DIY,removed,the mirrors themselves look cool the presentation however leaves something to be desired the exposed electrical band is interesting from a technical perspective but from an aesthetic one it looks terrible and the bulk of the mirrors and gaps between them make it look less like a skirt and more like a tool belt it would be much the same if you hung a bunch of hammers around your waist what you need to door rather what i would suggest is subdue the tech aspects and emphasize the infinity parts probably by changing the framing from white to a darker possibly metallic theme covering the electrical strip and by connecting the various mirror sections more firmly to make it seem like a contiguous whole in my ideal situation the leds would double up between mirrors by display on either side which would dramatically reduce the amount of wiring necessary over the entirety of the piece these would be set firmly in the borders with the flexing taking place between the mirrors and the partitions sorry you just kicked my engineer spirit into gear overall its really not bad for a prototype second note at that point whats the point in wearing a top at all you can clearly see everything anyway honestly curious

DIY,removed,that is bad mold not only are the spores bad for your health and lungs the mold also makes toxiccarcinogenic chemicals you need to wear a respirator organic vapor cartridges with filter and gloves when you remove this put it in garbage bags and seal and remove it quickly then vaccum with a hepa vac you can probably find a mold killing solution to clean the floor and anything else that was touching the moldy stuff but anything porous like drywall wood carpet paper etc that had mold on it has mold in it and needs to be gone then you clean probably should call your landlord or a professional since youll also want to find the source of the moisture and deal with it

DIY,removed,elmers
DIY,removed,obligatory youre welcome
DIY,removed,start with your legs
DIY,removed,nice job the only comment i have for people thinking about getting a bed frame like this is to not be surprised if you continually stub your toes and bang the shit out of your shins on it ive got a frame like this and for me something about having the mattress being significantly smaller than the frame is difficult to get used to especially in a dark room
DIY,removed,is this what diy is now
DIY,removed,looks like a cows ass sewed up with a grape vine
DIY,removed,rip shins
DIY,removed,just dont trip and smash your face onto the corner of your bed and watch your shins
DIY,removed,i inevitably get downloaded to oblivion for this but i always suggest that people put the finished product up on top because imgur is such a trainwreck to look at on my phone
DIY,removed,pretty sure that was a load bearing wall no amount of gold glue is going to hold that second floor up you need to check with an engineer though
DIY,removed,downvotes for finished product last
DIY,removed,the best bed is the kind where youll snap your shin in half coming back from a midnight piss
DIY,removed,so im still wondering why people insist on beginning sentences with so
DIY,removed,rip shins no literally thats going to rip apart your shins
DIY,removed,why do people who build their own beds hate their shins so much
DIY,removed,you will hate those corners the first time you catch your leg on them
DIY,removed,httpswwwredditcomrdiwhy
DIY,removed,how manytimes have you smacked your shin against one of those corners i say this because my bed has corners and i hit it regularly ive had it for years and i still hit it i finally wrapped them in some coats etc so it doesnt hurt so much when it happens if i had it to do all over again id want the corners to be rounded like a bullnose or even a sphere section
DIY,removed,the shin buster
DIY,removed,i should be subscribing to this subreddit because it will probably save me allot of money
DIY,removed,it looks incredibly sturdybut for guests without situational awareness of when drunk those exposed corners are going to make some significant bruises please warn your guests
DIY,removed,its beautiful really nice but if it were mine i would for sure bang my shins into that frame every night
DIY,removed,i would hit my shins every time

DIY,removed,well concrete is porous it can seep into the concrete and require extensive grinding to fix you are correct he could use some drop sheets to protect it but why risk it at all you asked if it would be better to paint before hand the answer is still no before if it gets under the drop sheet you have more work to do and possibly adhesion issues after you just wipe it up

DIY,removed,the second picture which op based his design on is actually made by a small business run by my greatuncle and aunt called sand rider beach wheelchairs they are fantastic people and started the business after going through the same struggle looking for a chair as op they were forced to search as a result of a motorcycle accident which left my greatuncle cofounder of sand rider in a wheelchair we are a very large and active family so he needed a way to keep up and began building his own chairs if it was up to my uncle he would give the chairs away for free because he really cares about the buyers as he knows the struggle they go through on the search for an offroad wheelchair im not sure if im allowed to post links or anything and i dont want to break any rules but you can find them by googling sand rider beach wheelchairs when you call youll talk to my uncle and im certain hell do everything in his power to help you out and while youre talking mention that his favorite nephew sent you im sure hell get a kick out of it and hell be happy that more people are going to be able to keep up with their families
DIY,removed,hey why dont you tie a couple alligators to the front of it to pull her around
DIY,removed,its not going to break its a onetime use vehicle id be concerned using it every day it will be totally fine please post an update to shut all the armchair engineers the fuck up
DIY,removed,you should add a couple alligators to pull it around
DIY,removed,httpstototechnologyblogspotcom
DIY,removed,in order to create each chair the three people in the small business need to have the metal frame cut shipped to a shop machined with space they need to rent shipped to their home in va beach where they combine the frame with the fabric for the seat and foot holds and arm wrests they assemble each chair paint them and ship them out via ups individually made to order my uncle his wife have grandchildren and my uncle is in a wheelchair they make each chair by hand and sell at a price which will allow them to maintain their business and help people they are not greedy and as a company which is less than two years old they are creating the best product in the market and are working to driving costs down which would be easier if the business was profitable enough to be run full time with more employees
DIY,removed,i weld i could weld up a nice sturdy version of this rickety piece of shit over the course of a day i also do work with wheelchair electronics are you saying i could potentially make a nice version of this and sell it for it makes me fucking angry op actually asked for more than like double the cost of material for this pile of shit

DIY,removed,your dad fucked your mom for less than half that
DIY,removed,like that dildo i used on your mother thanks by the way
DIY,removed,its crazy right theyve worked so hard on making the chair as efficient as possible
DIY,removed,you should reach out to sand rider wheelchairs if you use it regularly they are a small business run by a husband and wife who built their own chair after a motorcycle accident left the husband in a wheelchair they are incredibly nice understanding and make each chair individually to suit each buyer heres the chair in use certainly sturdy enough to be pushed rather than pulled
DIY,removed,the third picture is the sand rider beach wheelchair it is made of metal as opposed to pvc and uses low pressure offroad tires specifically chosen to travel smoothly over any terrain the owners and operators of sand rider wheelchairs are a couple based out of va beach they make each wheelchair by hand and ship them out of their garage op seemed to insinuate that they were a greedy company who was selling a chair at a considerable markup the truth is that they took care to make the design as comfortable and efficient as possible due to the fact that the coowner was left in a wheelchair after a motorcycle accident and was unable to find a chair which could suit his needs for any amount of money with sand rider wheelchairs you are getting your moneys worth and more they provide an unrivaled level of mobility for the disabled and elderly and are designed to be as portable and light as the strength requirement will allow i spoke to the owners and due to the traction this post is receiving they would be able to offer a discount if multiple parties were interested in chairs and the owners could purchase raw materials in bulk please check out the website it would absolutely make their day to be able to help others get back outdoes with their families httpscustombeachwheelchaircom
DIY,removed,please check out httpscustombeachwheelchaircom the owner has been in a chair for over a decade and has made it his mission to help others with his design him and his wife make each chair by hand and would love to help you find a chair or anyone else looking for more mobility

DIY,removed,httpscustombeachwheelchaircom offers wheelchairs with an option to include a seatbelt which will restrain even the most wily mils and has large tires and a rigid design to guarantee the chair will make it all the way to the water without a problem the owner has been in a chair for over a decade and has made it his mission to help others with his design him and his wife make each chair by hand and would love to help you find a chair or anyone else looking for more mobility
DIY,removed,that is absolutely true please check out httpscustombeachwheelchaircom the owner has been in a chair for over a decade and has made it his mission to help others with his design him and his wife make each chair by hand and would love to help you find a chair or anyone else looking for more mobility cost is an obvious drawback but they will work their hardest to help get everyone the mobility they desire and deserve
DIY,removed,httpsteespringcomlivefastdiyyoung
DIY,removed,this is the most ghettolooking piece of shit ever
DIY,removed,i agree and apologize for exaggerating but by your description it would appear that the chair is priced unusually high but im sure you can agree after building your own chair that between the strong materials and ability to be portable the sand rider chair is not unfairly priced furthermore i also apologize for overreacting its simply a point of high emotions for my family because the chair has helped us out so much between year olds and those permanently in wheelchairs seeing the chair in a negative light was disconcerting we want the chairs to be successful and have them help more people i appreciate your diy version and the traction youve gotten for it i just did t want people to think that they are priced out of the range of normal buyers the more people that but sand rider chairs the cheaper they will be and the better all the chairs in the market will be
DIY,removed,it means a lot to me and my family that the public knows sand rider is a small business and that we want to help people sorry for the spam the owners have never been on reddit and theres no one else looking out for the image of the brand im just trying to do my part

DIY,removed,here we have one of my favorite pieces the reason for gift cards a brief but impactful freestyle poem by nashedpotatos critically it was a failure the pessimistic naysaying attitude so blatantly splashed across their canvas was found to be a poor fit amongst the more positive supportive works of its time and place however with some contemplation and an open mind we can see past the cynical somewhat bitter words and catch a glimpse of the true character potatos is portraying here i cannot find it in my heart or soul to be happy potatos mouths silently while we distract ourselves with the negativity laid out neatly before us it all looks so barbed and yet we find it hard to remember how many of those barbs point inward while we focus on what we have pointed in our direction ponder on this as long as you like and we will move along in due time

DIY,removed,im going to chime in here with another reason some dogs need crating i have a year old rescued catahoula if he isnt crated when we go to bed or leave the house his anxiety goes through the roof he thinks hes been abandoned again he pees on the laundry room rug and tries to eat stuffing but the small space makes him feel secure if he ever gets scared thats the first place he goes its his safe zone he just goes in and goes to sleep that what he does most of the day anyways hes an old guy before we figured out crating was what he needed he was miserable we were miserable too i hated cleaning up his messes and spending the first hour of my day finding all the stuff he destroyed but his vet recommended crating and everyone is so happy it isnt a cage for torture or punishment its a training tool or a safe space
DIY,removed,i dont have an issue with crates too late to change how people treat pets anyways to play devils advocate if the reason you put them in a crate that small is just to keep them from pooping thats really not saying its good for them to be in a crate that small just that its the only way
DIY,removed,great question we have a family member let her out halfway through the day and when they are unavailable we have a neighbor do it she is well cared for and is a very happy dog shes still a puppy and when she is ready to be free all day we will do away with it i suggest you do more research on crate training to learn how its a humane way of training your dog
DIY,removed,the people that feel uneasy with it probably dont know anything about crate training or house breaking a dog
DIY,removed,so you didnt want a pet but rather wanted to have complete control over an innocent animals life im assuming you also get pissed off at himher when it doesnt behave exactly like you wantin other words like a dog
DIY,removed,wow it sounds like youre more proud of the furniture in which youve encased your dog than the actual dog did you get a dog just so you could do this
DIY,removed,i hope puts u in a cage and puts they r favorite tv show thing on it u piece of shit
DIY,removed,waiting on all the comments about how this is terrible because its not specially engineered fire brick and will explode if you put a fire in it
DIY,removed,probably part of the plan to accidentally have the cage collapse with the dog inside so he can keep his premium pine table top without having to love and nurture a healthy happy dog which hes clearly not into anyway
DIY,removed,did you use the boyfriend to mix the mortar most of us just use water and gravel but i guess bodily fluids and bone fragments would work just as well in a pinch
DIY,removed,the boyfriend charges for his time
DIY,removed,subaru shinandtoefuckerupper
DIY,removed,i feel like id stub my toe on that thing one too many times
DIY,removed,isnt quite ready to get free roam of the house while we are away at work you leave a fullgrown dog locked in there all day ive had dogs all my life understand their behaviour and needs quite well and and ive gotta say that that is just really fucking evil that has got to be one profoundly unhappy dog
DIY,removed,the only thing i am concerned about is what happened to the stark dire wolves better burn some incense to to get the bad mojo out
DIY,removed,as a german shepherd owner i love your dog and as an architect i love the woodworking that you have done here but that crate is very undersized for your pup my partners says pound dog crate at best her pound beagle fit well it a crate that size our pound shepherd no way the rule for crates is that the dog should be able to fully stand up fully turn around and then sit down whatever the crate is supposed to accomplish i hope it does so soon otherwise great job at wood finishing
DIY,removed,its not really for his dog but for his servant reek
DIY,removed,i may be blown up with downvotes for this but do people not understand that the dollar sign comes before the number
DIY,removed,most dogs will treat crate time as nap time especially if the owners are giving the dog the right amount of physical and mental exercise
DIY,removed,its a fucking show dog with fucking papers you cant board it it gets upset its hair falls out
DIY,removed,honest question why do people crate their fully grown dogs my family only ever had one dog which was when i was very young so i dont know too much about raising them but i remember we only had to crate him when he was a puppy and once he was fully grown we got rid of it is it just for when you have guests who may be afraid of dogs
DIY,removed,i dont understand why people get dos to put them in a cage and you are proud to show new dog jail
DIY,removed,feeling better about your dogprison now
DIY,removed,isnt the whole point of the questionable act of dog crating that its the one place where a dog can seclude itself for some peace and quiet thereby not completely hating the crate turning it into a coffee table seems to be shitting all over the one potentially redeeming quality of a crate
DIY,removed,theres a difference between loving to go into their crate to snooze and being resigned to the fact that they have shitty owners that broke them into the habit of being crated if you need a crate for your dog you werent suitable to own dogs in the first place
DIY,removed,why would you get a german shepherd if you dont have a back yard so fucking selfish you should stick with a small breads if you are going to lock them inside all day or just dont get a dog
DIY,removed,please dont put your dog in a cage
DIY,removed,yeah but you can do that with a room like laundry or bathroom so at least they can move around and get the exercise they need food water and they dont have to shit or piss in their bed if they are busting imagine being stuck in a closet under the stairs every weekday for a day just big enough to lie down if you curl you legs no stretch room
DIY,removed,because stupid people make the dog sad and the crate is a place for the dog to quietly nurse his sadness in a productive manner the dogs communication skills are far superior to yours
DIY,removed,goddam lochness monster again
DIY,removed,not here to start an argument but whats the purpose of the crate genuine question i only ask because my folks have always had a dog but they have never ever owned a crate is it a somewhat cultural thing i dont think i know of a single dog owner here in the uk that uses a crate as long as youre capable of training your dog i cant see why youd ever need one what am i missing here
DIY,removed,i dont understand crating why get a dog at all if you intend to keep it in a cage my dog roams free and has been able to since i brought her home shes now months old and knows very well what shes not supposed to chew destroy pee or poo on accidents happen surely but usually only because the door isnt opened early enough for her to go in the yard which isnt her fault a crate in my opinion creates nothing but a dog with an amplified case of stockholm syndrome seems like a lazy route to house training that said nice table top you got there
DIY,removed,not just dogs my cats love to go in their vet crate sometimes we leave it out because they love to crowd in there and sleep
DIY,removed,it does look great but the concept is odd to me i dont think ive ever heard of any one crating their dog in australia where is this from is it a regular thing
DIY,removed,the ring tho
DIY,removed,a cage is like being locked in a closet just high enough for you to stand and just wide enough for you to lie down with gratesbars claustrophobic enough id knock it over too
DIY,removed,if need a fucking cage for your dog you shouldnt have a dog
DIY,removed,get a cat instead of imprisoning your dog for hours on end
DIY,removed,winter is coming
DIY,removed,your views are pretty strong but thanks for sharing them they seemed odd to me but ive had some very reasoned responses and think there might be some middle ground here theyre just not a thing in aus and i had no idea thanks for your input
DIY,removed,winter is coming
DIY,removed,so what am i supposed to do with a dog when i leave the house for hours if left out they can and will eat something not only is it destructive but could potentially kill the dog
DIY,removed,youre wrong sometimes its a method employed by lazy and selfish owners sometimes its a method employed by diligent and selfless owners who have the dogs best interests at heart it depends how its being used the same as everything else in life it needs a lot of research and preferably consultation with a vet i sue a crate and i was specifically told by my vets not to think of it as a prison but as a safe space my anxious rescue can truly relax in
DIY,removed,dollar signs or did you mean
DIY,removed,the funny thing is every single person i know that uses a crate cares for their dog like its a member of the family putting more time and effort into their dogs than even human relationships i would put money on it that you are of the a dog should be a well trained pet variety of dog owner which dog do you think is happier the ultra disciplined one that has the freedom to roam around of the time or the one who is cared for almost as equal as another family member but has a safe space to sleep in or to go when things are a bit hectic around the house if you dont like to use them thats perfectly fine but you really shouldnt judge others for it based on your misguided opinion in my case one of my dogs is a rescue that suffers from anxiety issues if shes left out all night she gets very concerned about any little noise and can hurt herself by chewing her skin etc when she is in the crate she has less space to worry about and has a perfectly sound sleep until the morning when she wont even get up out of bed half the time when i open the door does that sound like shes unhappy in the crate
DIY,removed,i made my boyfriend build a fire pit that cost him
DIY,removed,grab a patent quickly
DIY,removed,winter is coming
DIY,removed,i love how pet owners call these things crates made completely of wooden slats with no gaps what you have is a dog cage its just the word cage has a negative association with being held against your will
DIY,removed,obviously they are just worried because of the got reference as well all know in got no one is safeso they are projecting that to ops dog
DIY,removed,hmm rdiy has really turned nasty
DIY,removed,crating dogs is fucked up go sit in a prison cell for day and ull understand fucked up op fucked up
DIY,removed,came here expecting mechwarrior
DIY,removed,dog cages are not tables they are not intended to be used as tables they are not structurally sound to carry weight on top of them because they are not tables do not do this project you are risking breaking the cage and whatever is inside of it
DIY,removed,dog cages are not tables they are not intended to be used as tables they are not structurally sound to carry weight on top of them because they are not tables do not do this project you are risking breaking the cage and whatever is inside of it
DIY,removed,i came here for the exploding fire pit comments i am disappointed
DIY,removed,people who keep their dogs in those little crates are sick and shouldnt own any pets

DIY,removed,congrats a coffee table thats stinks
DIY,removed,why are we automatically idiots or clueless we completely understand your reasoning behind crate training we just dont agree with it its possible to provide a safe enclosed environment for your dog without it having a door that locks why do you have to exhibit that much control over an animal a lot of people say that crating keeps their dog from chewing stuff up when they are away if youre worried about your dog chewing your stuff then why did you get a dog in the first place to those that say their dog loves to go lay in their crate thats great because it was their choice and youre no longer locking them in there however i would like to suggest that its possible that they like it now because you conditioned them to go in there at an early age they may have learned to actually enjoy the space but again you could have accomplished providing a safe haven without locking them inside of it the level of human arrogance when it comes to animals is appalling to me at the end of the day we dont really understand much of our environment at all and to say that we have proven that dogs prefer to be kept in a cage is ridiculous ask yourself this question did you get a dog for you or did you get a dog for the dog obviously it can be both but if it was more for you then youre terrible in my opinion
DIY,removed,so the boyfriend built the fire pit you just got all the supplies together
DIY,removed,the king in the rdiy

DIY,removed,rule im sure its in the sidebar and if it isnt it should be is finished product first theres many reasons to do it but my biggest one is that the old picture first actually takes away from the finished product a lot every time someone does this i think meh that wasnt really not that bad knowing that its the original not the finished and the whole time i have to reason with the changes instead of just starting with wow nice either way wow nice
DIY,removed,awesome job op and who amongst us hasnt been a bukkake target for a few extra bucks no shame in that

DIY,removed,saw pic and was like now thats a diy project i can get behind

DIY,removed,why are all the comments about mistaking the first picture for the finished product being removed
DIY,removed,nicely done at first i thought that its a joke because of the ladder in the first picture say bubba diy staircase
DIY,removed,at first glance i thought the first pic was the end result and thought they made some odd choices
DIY,removed,my error personally i blame the moron who decided to blow off the subreddits recommendation of putting the finished picture first its damn sure not my fault but its kind of people like you to step up
DIY,removed,i thought that the first pic was the finished one as people often do that one mans step ladder is another mans staircase
DIY,removed,i was really hoping the first picture was the completed staircase and this was a shitpost xd
DIY,removed,so when i opened the link and saw just the ladder i thought that was the joke
DIY,removed,congratulations on your mesothelioma
DIY,removed,thanks imgur crashed my reddit app like three times right before i could see the end
DIY,removed,i am used to people putting the finished picture first so i thought you just put a ladder there and called it a day
DIY,removed,did anyone else think finished product first and laugh a little
DIY,removed,i dont think thats equally stupid it looks great and its not a big deal for him and his wife to use the closet at alternate times and by alternate times i mean like a whole seconds after the other person hey can you close the closet for a sec i need to get in sure negative nancy
DIY,removed,id rather buy a and in carbon fiber body panels
DIY,removed,i didnt realize this was a series of pics thought you were being cheeky with the first ladder pic
DIY,removed,thats why i dont get the whole finished first thing i love seeing the old and the progress to the end
DIY,removed,at first i thought the staircase you made was just the ladder then i realized there was more than one picture
DIY,removed,not a diy remodel thread without the threat of asbestos
DIY,removed,i saw the first picture and i thought thats how wed fix that problem in michigan nothing else to do here
DIY,removed,people always quote the material cost but how much time did this take time has value
DIY,removed,im on mobile so i saw the first picture in the album and didnt relize it was an album so i thought you stairs was just a ladder going up to the next part
DIY,removed,you used to use a ladder to get in your basement
DIY,removed,i opened this up and the first picture i saw was the step ladder leaning against the wall below the door thought to myself yup thats good enough
DIY,removed,last pic started from the bottom now we here
DIY,removed,from the thumbnail i was expecting all that leading up to a big screw it with the ladder being the permanent solution
DIY,removed,i hate it when the before pictures are already nicer than my house
DIY,removed,from the first image i figured it was a joke
DIY,removed,lol i thought your fist pic was the final product i was like u rascal
DIY,removed,the title pic made it look like a joke i loled haha look at the staircase ladder🙁 thanks for the hehe
DIY,removed,sees first picture wow shittiest stairs ever oh wait
DIY,removed,i was sccrolling through rall and got a laugh thinking the thumbnail image was the finished product
DIY,removed,every single time i see one of these word clock posts i read it as world clock im starting to get worried at this point
DIY,removed,i only saw the ladder picture and thought this was like a parody
DIY,removed,at first i thought the staircase was just the ladder i had myself a good laugh on another note good job on the build
DIY,removed,on mobile it just is a picture of a ladder i scrolled through the comments for a while thinking this was a huge joke
DIY,removed,you can put ur weed in there
DIY,removed,anybody else think this was a joke pic from the thumbnail i saw made a basement staircase and saw a latter leaning up against the door this is why it helps to put the finalized pictures first
DIY,removed,because so many diys here begin with the finished product first i thought this was a troll post at first
DIY,removed,can we make it a thing to post before and after as pictures and for the mobile users

DIY,removed,imgurs top comment should be reddits top comment we know why she likes pineapples tho op we are looking at you gitgut
DIY,removed,my thoughts too plus the spare square feet or so for a wood shop the torch and stain cans of stain probably cost more than i will ever spend on coasters in my life not cheap not easy
DIY,removed,cheap and easy pallet coasters step buy a table saw
DIY,removed,better yet just use the box someone elses table came in
DIY,removed,cheap and easy step scroll saw no problem scroll saws are like at bunnings right
DIY,removed,if you are lazy thirsty rhino udara wood pallet coasters set of
DIY,removed,cheap and easy coasters involves scroll saw mini blow torch wood stain and ultimately doesnt deliver a functional coaster sounds about right for this subreddit
DIY,removed,with a stack of post its on top double win
DIY,removed,clearly asking the real questions here
DIY,removed,
DIY,removed,easy sure if you got machines
DIY,removed,or you could spend with uline and get one for free
DIY,removed,cheap and easy if you have access to thousands of dollars of tools
DIY,removed,the shell was free i built the roll cage myself using a tube bender i built myself i painted it myself i converted it from fwd to awd myself the list goes on but yeah i didnt forge the steel and stampweld the body panels myself so im still a sucker
DIY,removed,if some tool company started paying nick offerman to advertise for them as ron swanson i have to admit id probably end up buying whatever he was shilling for haha
DIY,removed,cheap and easy hahaha step buy a machine saw or pay a small fortune to use a diy studio in the city
DIY,removed,oh happy days happy dayschesnut found him a new dining room table
DIY,removed,he could have fashioned the tools out of stone found outside his house then using his stone tools cut down trees nearby to create better tools with wooden handles and strips of barks to tie the stone heads to the wooden handles then using those tools gathered enough metal ore by digging in his backyard combined with trees he had fell with his stone axe he smelted some basic bronze tools that allowed him to break through the bedrock and look for harder metals such as iron and maybe even some coal or peat his bronze tools could enable him to build better furnaces to achieve higher temperatures and melt iron and maybe throw in some coal and zinc he now has steel tools but he still needs a few more steps to create a smartphone that allowed him to upload good quality pics for this post
DIY,removed,ehjust buy some sticky note pads from uline that are already mounted on them saved you hours
DIY,removed,easy is something you can make at homei dont have a table saw or leftover to cut
DIY,removed,cheap just buy some high grade woodworking equipment that will rack up a few hundred dollars
DIY,removed,for those who dont have the proper equipment andor ambition to make these you can buy them httpwwwminimaterialscomcollectionspallets
DIY,removed,just went through your build proper workmanship there man incredible cage keep the good work up
DIY,removed,ron swanson eat your heart out

DIY,removed,while the deck is no doubt visually appealing i have noticed some major structural flaws the concrete foundation seems to be detached from the upper mantle layer also called the asthenosphere without that your deck has a chance of floating away as far as to the thermosphere the wood seems to bear a stain called a duplotrex composite while that is okay for wooden beams used in industrial anchoring it is not advised to be used without a proper insulating finish which in this case costs a fortune there also seems to be an issue with how the deck is attached to the house itself could you possibly provide photos of the foundation of the home in case there is a problem with the junction of its foundation to the upper mantle

DIY,removed,everybody get down
DIY,removed,and this is why i downvote not because there is a typo but because so jackass mod cant let there be jokes about it mod tip putting improvised explosive device in a title is going to get lots of comments and should probably be removed so it can be fixed otherwise it breaks your own rules regarding inappropriate post titles i get that its a mistake but a mistake that is easily fixed by having it reposted

DIY,removed,i guess you can say the comments blew up
DIY,removed,improvised explosive device sign
DIY,removed,at least make this into a containment thread for ied jokes killjoy i had a great one lined up
DIY,removed,i only came into the thread to make a dadjoke about the typo even though the project is cool
DIY,removed,why would you gift a bomb to your so must be a regional thing

DIY,removed,no need to be so explosive about it
DIY,removed,i think it was intentional to make people think he made an ied for his gf
DIY,removed,ied muslim
DIY,removed,so where is the ied
DIY,removed,nothing against the project but it seems like the only reason this made it to the front page was the typo if you dont want talk about ieds repost without ied in the title
DIY,removed,i wasnt fast enough i saw the title came to say something like you made him an ied run but alas i was beaten to it
DIY,removed,wificontrolled improvised explosive device
DIY,removed,ive never seen so many removed comments my god the butt hurt is strong here op
DIY,removed,improvised explosive device
DIY,removed,it would take literally seconds to delete the post and replace it with one without the typo and then the op loses of their discussion and any popularity their post had no rdiy rule was broken thus no reason for this post removal dont put led in the title especially given what happened over the weekend people were making jokes about it not discussing what happened over the weekend it was variations of the same joke i bet hes so excited he could just explode guidelines become rules our guidelines are our rules theyre pretty simple and clearly defined staying on topic is not difficult to do the op submitted a project discuss the project if you dont wish to discuss the project thats your decision we cant change your mind but the op deserves proper discussion about his post instead of lame attempts at a joke that wasnt original or clever the first times rdiy is different from other subreddits our discussions revolve around the projects submitted here and we keep it that way im sorry that you dont want to discuss the project have a great day
DIY,removed,an ied you say what did your boyfriend do to you
DIY,removed,as a former eod soldier explosive ordinance disposal that title takes on a whole new meaning ied improvised explosive device
DIY,removed,whats upp with this thread being ℅

DIY,removed,httpimgurcomacioqq
DIY,removed,
DIY,removed,smart sexy and nerdy rip ur inbox
DIY,removed,nice lc double ds
DIY,removed,nice boobs
DIY,removed,do you have a boyfriend
DIY,removed,type less and post more seminudies please
DIY,removed,my question got downvoted so ill ask again do you have a boyfriend
DIY,removed,those guys who pretend theyre interested in your electronic stuff are so funny heheh larson scanner give me abgreak d btw are they natural if so awesome
DIY,removed,i cant read chinese hieroglyphics but im pretty sure the second half was teetering on nsfw
DIY,removed,yeah inspiring thats what its called
DIY,removed,my father was mister scanner call me larson
DIY,removed,thats a huge ship in the background
DIY,removed,so you dont have a boyfriend what a waste
DIY,removed,funny you couldnt pick that up in any of the pictures i guess its more about the anyway
DIY,removed,you should start postin in the rgonewild subreddit ok
DIY,removed,well showing your tits is a really cool idea wish more girls would do that
DIY,removed,girls show their tits because guys are interested in electronics wackyvorlon
DIY,removed,i made a variable boner watching this for science
DIY,removed,wheres her ass
DIY,removed,yeah because if i posted a variableopacity manthong where everyone could see my dong im definitely just wanting to show off my interesting project and how dare anybody make comments about my schlong right give me a fuckin break the white knighting in this thread is ridiculous
DIY,removed,first of all i agree that rdiy is not a place for sexual discussions nor should anyone be subject to unwanted andor inappropriate sexual advances anywhere on reddit however it seems that posting as sexycyborg with a translucent top and a build album in which only out of pictures are actually of the project is getting close to breaking the rules too is there any good place we can have a conversation about where the good content line should be or is that up to the mod team to decide without a public discussion which would be fine too
DIY,removed,nice also nice upper body but i dont see the opacity feature in action
DIY,removed,i put iphones on titties
DIY,removed,nice tits
DIY,removed,someone just bought new tits and wants to show them off
DIY,removed,boobs
DIY,removed,you built something but the point is to be pretty much naked go girl power rolls eyes
DIY,removed,girl develops a device that literally exposes her breasts on command guy mentions breasts idiots get whiteknightey her username is sexycyborg come on seriously it isnt a very cool idea in my opinion it serves no real purpose other than garnering attention its just lcds which have been around for a long time and have been used for way cooler things
DIY,removed,inappropriate comments especially those of a sexual nature will be removed and may result in a ban from rdiy lolokay
DIY,removed,lets just censor everyone who decides not to ignore the elephant in the room right mods maybe sexycyborg should work on a project that doesnt involve copious amounts of sexual imagery if the discussion isnt supposed to involve sex if i invent an arduinocontrolled fucking machine and post a video of an attractive girl using it it would be insane to expect the discussion to only pertain to the project sexual comments do pertain to the project when the project itself is clearly sexuallycharged i understand that harassment is wrong but so is undue censorship
DIY,removed,id love to short circuit her splooge
DIY,removed,these are the same people who have halfnaked anime chicks on their walls its just pricks wanting to keep the boys club purified and women objectified for their own means a lot of people are cool and appreciate sexycyborg but not everyone likes women to do more than bake them cakes and rub their knob
DIY,removed,thats quite unfair the big tits werent needed to show off the project lol but they were main part of this submission so naturally they will be a topic of discussion id love if youd censor the op if you dont like tits but do not censor commentors theyre the heart of reddit after all
DIY,removed,whats your fitness routine
DIY,removed,my eyes are up here
DIY,removed,rupvotedbecausegirl
DIY,removed,hows white knighting going for you
DIY,removed,so the goal was to use some phones as a shirt then get defensive about any insinuations that you were simply trying to draw attention to your breasts
DIY,removed,google is blocked but fake hooters is a go i see where your priorities are china
DIY,removed,wow make up can do wonderss
DIY,removed,i partially agree with your idea to keep the comment section civilized but i hope you can have a talk with the op as well and reduce the amount of unnecessary pictures from the diy that amount of boobage is not required to show that the product works photographs might be enough be reasonable and reprimand both sides it is unreasonable when you insult someone who would make a inappropriate comment but then let the op post anything they like
DIY,removed,she sort of has that anri okita face that makes me jizz
DIY,removed,username checks out
DIY,removed,dude reddit got bought by a news company a long time ago most national news outlets dont even allow comments on many of their articles anymore reddit is not a bastion of free speech its a swirling pool of content with ad taxes thrown in or just embedded reddit is becoming a look dont touch or think content museum rip swartz cant imagine what kind of pressure he was under
DIY,removed,where are your gone wild pictures
DIY,removed,there are a lot of neckbeards grabbing tissues and lotion rn
DIY,removed,looks like a suicide vest
DIY,removed,surely its just the science that gets the upvotes surely
DIY,removed,uhhhh am i missing something or did she just strap a bunch of turned off phones to her tits
DIY,removed,what happened to your ass
DIY,removed,i just had a cheongasm looking at her picture
DIY,removed,why did you delete all the comments discussing this
DIY,removed,is this just an automatic posting everytime she posts one of her awesome projects
DIY,removed,no hips that girl would need a csection if she ever got pregnant
DIY,removed,glad to be sitting down for this
DIY,removed,are you kidding me you allow an explicitly sexual post then threaten people with banning if they comment on the fact that the pos is explicitly sexual and then go as far as to delete a comment chain pointing out your hypocrisy there was healthy productive dialogue happening in that thread censorship is not how reddit works if you want to take a draconian policy you deserve to at least defend it publicly judging by the fact that you deleted the other thread and probably will delete this comment too i can only assume that you realize your stance makes no sense and is not defendable otherwise what is the harm in explaining it
DIY,removed,yeah ok she literally posted half naked pics for attention and we get scolded lol
DIY,removed,how is chongesam formed
DIY,removed,thats a lot of work for something that people are only interested in what it covers
DIY,removed,nsfwdiycom
DIY,removed,due to your censorship i will now be unsubscribing from diy and this makes me slowly move away from reddit as a whole
DIY,removed,so were we supposed to be able to see bare tit in this
DIY,removed,wud like a front pic on opacity
DIY,removed,stupid pasties lol
DIY,removed,heh nice tits
DIY,removed,the discussion was removed so as to not hijack ops post wed be more than happy to discuss it privately not on ops post we never want to take aware attention from a poster any poster regardless of who it is when we make a sticky post we do so to get information across not to argue with users the discussion was turning into just that and as such it was removed we are more than happy to have a discussion privately off this thread
DIY,removed,that was not a discussion about sexism harassment or makes stance that was people commenting on how they should be free to harass a user based on how she is dressed regardless our sticky threads are meant to get information across not to start arguments we are more than happy to discuss issues privately so that we are not taking attention away from the op any op
DIY,removed,f you and your cencorship
DIY,removed,playboy with some tech strapped to the boobs you say that like its a bad thing s
DIY,removed,lets agree to disagree but it is a bit like rwatchitfortheplot here
DIY,removed,just looks like you stuck cell phones over your boobs
DIY,removed,dont kid yourself you made i top out of iphones and now your getting praise cause you have big tits no hate just the truth
DIY,removed,gee i wonder why make magazine doesnt publish midriff pics
DIY,removed,apparently if a girl dresses sexy your not supposed to mention it unless of course your rich tall and handsome
DIY,removed,runbgbbiivchidctiicbg
DIY,removed,a cry for attention
DIY,removed,so where is the videos of it doing that with you wearing it why else wear it as a top
DIY,removed,this is not an awesome project its flagrant karma hunting using the project as a prop while really flaunting her body rdiy is not the place for this and censoring comments like this redanditchy points hours ago why did you delete all the comments discussing this permalink parent is causing me to unsub so go ahead and ban away
DIY,removed,kinda sad that this notice is necessary every time usexycyborg posts here
DIY,removed,how is getting your tits out but sort of wrapped in tech that oh hey flashes nipples in any way inspiring to women in tech
DIY,removed,comments made should be ontopic and civil inappropriate comments especially those of a sexual nature will be removed and may result in a ban from rdiy i dont get this you host a project thats nsfw expect some responses that are nsfw we arent children here
DIY,removed,it is not a think of the children argument make wants the focus on the ideas and tech not hot bodies it keeps the assholes like you away so everyone else isnt discouraged by the lowest common denominator
DIY,removed,is it possible to eat a banana while wearing this top for scale
DIY,removed,i agree i take her way more seriously with her tits out sarcasm aside shes not empowering herself as a woman she just being strictly antisocietal
DIY,removed,i read the chinese article at the end of the photo album what was that all about are you mad that no one noticed you are you trying to become a celebrity in china
DIY,removed,not even an ugly girl if it were a woman without ops massive breasts it would be less popular
DIY,removed,im assuming you get constantly hit on
DIY,removed,if theyre all being submitted by users like usexycyborg then i dont see a single problem with that
DIY,removed,breast cancer
DIY,removed,she clearly covers the sexuality bit in her article therefore it should be fair game and on topic
DIY,removed,dont even have to read the comments to hear the fedora tipping white knights mladying from a distance in this thread
DIY,removed,in all honesty who didnt come here for the boobs
DIY,removed,rupvotedbecausegirl
DIY,removed,nice work on the plastic around the chest the phone tube top thing isnt bad either
DIY,removed,meeeeeeeeeeeeeee
DIY,removed,found the neckbeard
DIY,removed,so whats the exact point of this not hating but is it for a high tech strip joint like topless girls that dont need to take off the bra efficient
DIY,removed,did that shirt just assume my gender
DIY,removed,get real bro the guys are just looking at her tits and ass noone cares abut the top
DIY,removed,better to just get your tits and ass out for the boys
DIY,removed,she is a hot chick people are only interested because she looks like a good fuck
DIY,removed,do you have concerns about moisture i hope so
DIY,removed,yeah i like asian girls too
DIY,removed,lookatme im mr meeseeks culture
DIY,removed,so does her hard nipples cut the glass when shes cold
DIY,removed,shes got huge tracts of land
DIY,removed,her boobs sucked the life outta her booty and what are those boots lol
DIY,removed,donnie darko why are you wearing that stupid bunny suit frank why are you wearing that stupid man suit
DIY,removed,nice underboob as always keep up the good work my man
DIY,removed,have we deteriorated to the level of dumb beasts
DIY,removed,
DIY,removed,look i strapped a bunch of phones to my tits im an engineer
DIY,removed,no code violation comments at the top
DIY,removed,i always laugh at the no sexuality guideline this user is trading on her sexuality what an embarrassment
DIY,removed,wow love the fact that you show your face you are cute in all that fur i want you
DIY,removed,harsh environment we sweat and can run long distances in high heat without dying whe our prey overheats freedom of movement we are the best at throwing stuff we have fine motor control we can run swim crawl backflip climb jump fightvery diverse movements tools sure a crow can use a stick can it use wikipedia
DIY,removed,except that half the imgur album has nothing to do with the build
DIY,removed,so lets get this straight she invented a device purely to randomly show off her nipples that is the full purpose of the device and youre going to say that comments of a sexual nature are not allowed then get rid of her post its purely of a sexual nature and half of her pictures are just her wearing the device
DIY,removed,those are fake right wait nvm it doesnt really matter
DIY,removed,technically canada is in america
DIY,removed,did mexico pay for it
DIY,removed,bears beets battlestar galactica
DIY,removed,butthe post itself is sexual in nature
DIY,removed,rupvotedbecausegirl
DIY,removed,thank you this needed to be said

DIY,removed,for a minute i thought you cut off one of your fingers
DIY,removed,this is pretty cool but a part of me cant help but squint at this post and wonder if its one of those advertisements posing as authentic reddit content that ive heard about
DIY,removed,rhailcorporate

DIY,removed,rhailcorporate
DIY,removed,or screwed screw is my go to for everything i cant nail or bang
DIY,removed,im with you on this apparently is angered at the idea of learning a new skill to do something but once you have the skill this is super quick and super easy hell hes trying to argue that he should get for his free time to learn a thing he wants to learn so do i get to factor in the potential lifetime return on this skill in the price because in that case cost of printing it is a fairly large negative number
DIY,removed,could use flexseal complete with annoying guy and all with flexseal that broken faucet is as good as new i can hear it in my head make the voice stop augh darn you flexseal man

DIY,removed,this is an obvious ad for sugru i feel like theyre taking advantage of me trying to entertain myself by sneaking ads into the place i go to entertain myself
DIY,removed,id love to see op follow back up in a month i have a hunch that this is a very shortterm fix to a problem tops if you truly diy nice little commercial though rhailcorporate

DIY,removed,suicidal tree
DIY,removed,im confused did you even look at the post do you know what unfinished cherry wood looks like op used a stain to finish this piece its pretty standard the color you see in the first pic is not natural cherry wood do some research like it or not current decorating trends have moved past the light wood color he used using this color stain dates the piece if he created this to sell it will be challenging as most people would not like this color if he made it for himself thats fine he just has dated tastes or lives in a house that hasnt been updated in a while and this will fit right it in the future make sure you have a clue what youre talking about before writing some snide remark
DIY,removed,jesus christ youre dull two separate posts confirming your ignorance just refer to the other response i gave you theres a reason the colors of furniture at target pier z gallery etc trend a certain way its in style something you have no sense of btw the color of the stain has no bearing at all on the quality of the craftsmanship not sure why youre getting so caught up on that
DIY,removed,have them take you to a therapist itll bore them to death just waiting in the waiting room while youre in there
DIY,removed,i dont think anyone here wants to be an accomplice to murder

DIY,removed,years from now your dad gets involved in a car accident and is lying in hospital in a coma his coma manifests itself as a dark horror film nightmare where he is being stalked by a shadowy figure in a big spooky mansion getting darker and colder by the minute the mansion is getting darker his breath pierces the night the shadowy figure creeping slowly finally has your dad cornered the life support machine bleeps and it looks like your dad is fading he has given up fighting his face fills with fear and dread the situation is hopeless his mind seems to have accepted his inevitable end he reaches back his mind prepared for his final journey his life in a moment briefly flashes before him in a brilliant flash something is different something has changed he has remembered something and then he looks down to his hand its the hammer the brightly restored pristine hammer its a symbol of you his love for you and yours for him his connection to the world he lifts his arm and with all his might strikes the shadowy figure with the pristine shiny hammer the struggle is real the figure and your father wrestle in a prolonged strained fight that seems to last the night eventually both exhausted your dad holds the figure and with one final strike hits the figure and it disappears into nothing the heart machine starts beeping normally the dark mansion becomes bright as if day and the fades to a brilliant white his eyes open he awakes and comes out of his coma surrounded by crying family his first words to you with tear filled eyes are couldnt you have restored my shotgun instead

DIY,removed,even if the point of sharing was to teach there is no problem here it is just as important to learn what not to do as it is to learn what to do warnings vs examples and all that
DIY,removed,i dont think theres a structural reason one could last longer than the other do you still want to see the brick if the guy you got is an experienced mason he can probably give you better advice than me
DIY,removed,hey that really came out great good job yeah you can put on another coat now if you want now would also be a good time to double check how plumb you are
DIY,removed,yeah holes you can just pack an old brick or stone in with the mortar you should be ok in that temp range thick is probably about as thick as you can go in one coat kind of just see how it feels as youre doing it if its real easy to do a little thinner then nothing wrong with that one last thing if you set up a plumb stud you can probably just pack the mortar or cement right in there give it a couple hours to cure pull the stud off and then patch the holes probably do a little test area somewhere hidden first once you know how the mortar or cement mix feels when youre working it youll feel a lot more comfortableconfident
DIY,removed,who are you trying to sell to this is a diy forum the point is doing it yourself you can install a door for well under if you do it yourself
DIY,removed,nice never saw that before that could save a lot of work and potentially a jackhammer rental would need a special toilet and to build the shower or tub on top of a frame to get that slope the shower ptrap would require a little extra thought
DIY,removed,you could try putting a bolt and washers through the flanges that are perpendicular to the metal piece as you tighten it down it might cinch the plastic back together even if you get that bolt in there i wouldnt be surprised if it failed again within a few months plastic is not a very repairable material
DIY,removed,the upflush toilet it is a macerator that pumps everything upward to the main drain line all things being equal this would probably be the way to go guessing that since you have a basement you have winters that means an addition would require actual excavation and foundation work which is very expensive if you cant do it yourself removing the roof on a garage and then adding a second story would be very expensive putting in a toilet in the basement is diyable you will need to cut out parts of the slab to run your drain lines then youll have a little pit area where the macerator goes that will pump everything straight over to your main plumbing drain
DIY,removed,i dont think the walls need to be removed you can parge and repoint yourself the materials are very cheap it is good honest hard work but not back breaking if the brick itself is getting really rough on the exterior you can parge that too course theres no going back there it is really important to keep the rain away from masonry in the north east the freezethaw in the the spring and fall is what kills the masonry thats wild they poured a slab roof on top of a homeowner garage that would be so damn expensive today one last thing i like this guy on youtube mike haduck he is an old timer mason out of pa that guy knows his stuff if it works there it works in massachusetts
DIY,removed,well theres more than one way to skin a cat i dont think theres anything wrong with doing it that way anything in contact with concrete or stone at minimum needs a capillary break polyethylene or a roll of sill seal you could staple it to the wood before you put it up andor be pressure treated if you dont want to grout it then youre gonna need a couple cans of spray foam to really seal up the space between the framing and the brick also in you can bet those guys were using portland i am guessing you are in the north east based on how eaten up the mortar is on the brickwork and finally mortar even today has lime in it portland is the component that they added about years ago some guys say you cant use portland when repointing really old stone walls im not sure i agree with that in the north east though if it was me for cost id just go ahead and parge it if that opening is already very plumb you might not even need to do the strings like i was suggesting and just eyeball it then you can frame it out heck you could even plumb up a couple on the wall and use that as a guide for parging
DIY,removed,the exterior is sided now they also used to lay two courses of brick as a structural wall it is definitely possible there are no studs are the window sills deep this is the problem with old houses they are just one big mystery on top of that years of different owners and a lot of funny things can be done to a house there are expanding type screws that can be used to fasten things like tvs to the wall
DIY,removed,i would use a plumb bob to get me perfectly plumb and straight on both corners i would then a secure mason line on both corners so i had something to work to at least wet down the surface before parging one better is to mix portland with water to make a paint and apply that right before parging in my opinion type s mortar would be fine
DIY,removed,youre absolutely right one of the worst mistakes diyers make is assuming screws are strong those strongtie screws are really expensive a doubled lvl can just get nailed off with commons one up top one at the bottom
DIY,removed,we make a version of this that we sell to museums schools and for outreach for groups dealing with water issues they are super fun so much so that one of our customers has to regularly turn theirs off so that visitors will look at other displays i have built quite a few of them now so if you have any questions about building one fire away you can see some videos of it in action at our website httpwwwtopoboxco
DIY,removed,i dont think theres a structural reason one could last longer than the other do you still want to see the brick if the guy you got is an experienced mason he can probably give you better advice than me
DIY,removed,yeah holes you can just pack an old brick or stone in with the mortar you should be ok in that temp range thick is probably about as thick as you can go in one coat kind of just see how it feels as youre doing it if its real easy to do a little thinner then nothing wrong with that one last thing if you set up a plumb stud you can probably just pack the mortar or cement right in there give it a couple hours to cure pull the stud off and then patch the holes probably do a little test area somewhere hidden first once you know how the mortar or cement mix feels when youre working it youll feel a lot more comfortableconfident
DIY,removed,who are you trying to sell to this is a diy forum the point is doing it yourself you can install a door for well under if you do it yourself
DIY,removed,all those prices sound like they include labor you are high on all those material costs
DIY,removed,nice never saw that before that could save a lot of work and potentially a jackhammer rental would need a special toilet and to build the shower or tub on top of a frame to get that slope the shower ptrap would require a little extra thought
DIY,removed,you could try putting a bolt and washers through the flanges that are perpendicular to the metal piece as you tighten it down it might cinch the plastic back together even if you get that bolt in there i wouldnt be surprised if it failed again within a few months plastic is not a very repairable material
DIY,removed,the upflush toilet it is a macerator that pumps everything upward to the main drain line all things being equal this would probably be the way to go guessing that since you have a basement you have winters that means an addition would require actual excavation and foundation work which is very expensive if you cant do it yourself removing the roof on a garage and then adding a second story would be very expensive putting in a toilet in the basement is diyable you will need to cut out parts of the slab to run your drain lines then youll have a little pit area where the macerator goes that will pump everything straight over to your main plumbing drain
DIY,removed,i dont think the walls need to be removed you can parge and repoint yourself the materials are very cheap it is good honest hard work but not back breaking if the brick itself is getting really rough on the exterior you can parge that too course theres no going back there it is really important to keep the rain away from masonry in the north east the freezethaw in the the spring and fall is what kills the masonry thats wild they poured a slab roof on top of a homeowner garage that would be so damn expensive today one last thing i like this guy on youtube mike haduck he is an old timer mason out of pa that guy knows his stuff if it works there it works in massachusetts
DIY,removed,well theres more than one way to skin a cat i dont think theres anything wrong with doing it that way anything in contact with concrete or stone at minimum needs a capillary break polyethylene or a roll of sill seal you could staple it to the wood before you put it up andor be pressure treated if you dont want to grout it then youre gonna need a couple cans of spray foam to really seal up the space between the framing and the brick also in you can bet those guys were using portland i am guessing you are in the north east based on how eaten up the mortar is on the brickwork and finally mortar even today has lime in it portland is the component that they added about years ago some guys say you cant use portland when repointing really old stone walls im not sure i agree with that in the north east though if it was me for cost id just go ahead and parge it if that opening is already very plumb you might not even need to do the strings like i was suggesting and just eyeball it then you can frame it out heck you could even plumb up a couple on the wall and use that as a guide for parging
DIY,removed,this guys right once youve grouted it itll look just fine definitely need regular old sanded grout because the gaps are too big for nonsand someone below mentioned nonsand grout and is wrong about that it looks like you siliconed the corners already if so thats good where the tile ends or in any corners you use bathroom caulk not grout i see pros do that wrong it will crack and let water in within a year or two also grout is not waterproof you need to use a sealant on the grout once its dry
DIY,removed,the exterior is sided now they also used to lay two courses of brick as a structural wall it is definitely possible there are no studs are the window sills deep this is the problem with old houses they are just one big mystery on top of that years of different owners and a lot of funny things can be done to a house there are expanding type screws that can be used to fasten things like tvs to the wall
DIY,removed,well if you have a router you must have a circular saw why not get a big speed square use that as your guide and go to town with the circular saw could have that done in no time
DIY,removed,i would use a plumb bob to get me perfectly plumb and straight on both corners i would then a secure mason line on both corners so i had something to work to at least wet down the surface before parging one better is to mix portland with water to make a paint and apply that right before parging in my opinion type s mortar would be fine
DIY,removed,mix some portland with water to make a paint paint the whole surface right before parging
DIY,removed,here is ours

DIY,removed,this is possibly not a simple question or even the right place but im at my wits end my kitchen and front room lead on to each other im looking to get power and plumbing for a dishwasher done in the kitchen on the wall that adjoins the front room at the same time since theyre doing power work on one side of the wall i want them to pop through and put two power points on the other side of the wall in the front room heres a diagram the kitchen has two sets of two power points in the bottomright corner on the diagram the power pointswitch for the cooker is in the topright corner in the topleft corner is an electric extractor fan with a fuse boxswitch next to it so far ive had two people out to quote the first quoted me £ for the dishwasher point saying he couldnt run power from the fuse box for the fan and would have to run a spur round the kitchen from the bottomright power points putting a fuse box and switch for the dishwasher next to those points he said he couldnt run power to the front room that way and would need to extend the ring main to the front room which would be an additional £ hmmn i thought and rang up another company they said it was a trivial job and quoted me £ all in with the power run from the fan fuse box to both the dishwasher and the front room very hmmn i thought tldr while this isnt strictly diy does anyone with more electrical experience than i have know which of these guys or both is trying it on how complex should this job be and how much should i expect to pay

DIY,removed,
DIY,removed,hi there thanks for posting to rdiy unfortunately weve had to remove your submission because of the last line about hiring somebody to help you with the design process as seeking paid assistance breaks our rules about what sorts of questions are and are not allowed on this subreddit if youre willing to remove that line and let us know when its been done so we can reapprove the post thanks

DIY,removed,ffs seriously im so tired of seeing these things posted without mentioning the httpsgithubcommichmichmagicmirror and then even trying to market them this is the new i built my own computer that gamers use to impress their parents i feel rude for having said that but im just sick of seeing magicmirrors on rdiy there are separate subreddits for rsmartmirrors and rsmartmirror each and every one that ends up on diy eventually tries to kickstart it or market it in some way without acknowledging the community involved to make these there are very on making these including everything in this very post it feels like theres a httpmichaelteeuwnltaggedmagicmirror and each creator passes it off as this mirroros that i came up with while being frustrated not knowing the weather while i was shaving or something along those lines not accusing op of any of this but we seriously need to start redirecting magicmirror posts to a new subreddit its tiring at this point

DIY,removed,all this talk of teepee aesthetic meanwhile tribal members are laughing their asses off at this sad attempt at a teepee fucking white people
DIY,removed,let me just file this under shit white people do
DIY,removed,cornholio
DIY,removed,no youre wrong native plains tribes still use teepees and they are still built out of materials they were originally made of get your ignorant false facts out of here theres a difference between building a structure and appropriating culture you can build a teepeelike structure if you want you dont get to call it a teepee or associate it with native american culture or draw fucking false native symbols on it because you think its cool thats the definition of appropriation of culture white guilt is a bitch im sure but its even more distressing to see your culture being so badly represented by someone who doesnt know anything about the culture except that they think they can use it as a novelty you dont get to decide how it affects the indigenous people of which this art and cultural heritage belongs to its wouldnt a waste of time and energy if people actually paid attention to the native peoples when they say over and over how this isnt appropriate and it should stop

DIY,removed,looks like cancer
DIY,removed,i dont mean to concern you but there is a growing sentiment that the rubber they use from recycled tires may not be safe a large number of kids that play soccer on fields that use artificial turf and the little rubber pellets made from recycled tires ended up getting cancer and it seems to be linked to chemicals and whatnot from the tires i saw a piece they did on hbo real sports im not an expert nor am i trying to scare you but i would do some research about it before your kids play on it for years
DIY,removed,so many cunts here

DIY,not_removed,rude
DIY,not_removed,home depot has professional tools for rental i used the plumbing snake to route out the roots which invaded my drain it worked minutes done it took more time to get the heavy ass thing into the basement than it did to use it it is a two man job to carry down or you break it down into two pieces it is ft long bring a garden hose with to rinse everything off you have to clean it before you return it then use a treatment of rootkill in the toiletfollow directions before you go to bed
DIY,not_removed,this doesnt sound like a diy job honestly
DIY,not_removed,you need a professional plumber for this one
DIY,not_removed,the same thing happened to me the clog is the main sewer line we managed to get it unstuck with boiling water patience plunging intervals and prodigious use of compound expletives i wish you luck

DIY,not_removed,this happen to my folks and we found out it was roots that invaded the sewage drain the plumber with their industrial snake removed some of the roots but we had to later on remove the pipe completely because it had a hole from where the roots entered
DIY,not_removed,sweet job op just wait till buzzfeed and pinterest steal borrow your idea oh and some old school edison bulbs would be tits
DIY,not_removed,looks good might be worth buying a dimming pot to dim them down a bit since the lights arent diffused at all theyre cheap and easy to wire
DIY,not_removed,i like the way you did the heightlength for each bulb well done
DIY,not_removed,electrician here firstly sweet job secondly the only thing id suggest is grounding each of the metal pipes if that single insulated cable breaks down because of heat our whatever over time they have the potential to become live and someone could get a nasty shock if changing globes out not sure what the standards are in your country but if its not double insulated cable its definitely worth grounding metal parts
DIY,not_removed,sorry ill also be that annoying guy but incandescent bulbs these are illegal in my country incandescent bulbs in closed fixtures i would of course recommend you get a true led bulb they exist in nonugly version too one example of a pretty sexy one though this specific model is not dimmable but its not very bright i know you should be able to find one that can be dimmed note that i picked that bulb randomly based on criteria and havent actually used it a tiny detail maybe you could get a bulb socket that match the color of the pipes black or maybe something like brassgold the same color as the inside of the fitters im not sure if its safe to just spray paint them though otherwise i like the overall feel of it and personally i like the dark stain would look perfect with the above bulb
DIY,not_removed,haha thanks yess i like your thinking will switch to edison bulbs once these burn out
DIY,not_removed,these are hooked up to a dimmer switch does wiring in a dimming pot limit the maximum brightness sorry not familiar thanks
DIY,not_removed,thanks i am really glad it worked out on the first try because cutting those by hand with the small cutter i had were a pain
DIY,not_removed,thank you for the information ill have to check if its double insulated
DIY,not_removed,thanks for your feedback in hindsight i wish i went with a lighter color but oh well there is no pressure where the wire is touching the pipe since the weight of each light is on the pipe and the wire has slack but good point on the grounding ill have to check on that thanks
DIY,not_removed,thanks didnt know about those bulbs yea enclosed but the globe and fitting and designed for lighting so i think it should be fine will switch to those leds definitely once these burn out honestly i dont notice the sockets and it would be quite a pain to replace them at this point i also didnt see any black ones while buying but im sure they were out there
DIY,not_removed,oh ok dimming potswitch whatever works to dim it down to a nice brightness and remembers where you set it to sometimes it can be a pain to find a dimmer compatible with the light so its nice they supplied one nah the max isnt affected on the dimmer is equivalent to if it wasnt there
DIY,not_removed,got it thanks
DIY,not_removed,great holster now go make yourself a belt that will hold that goddamn setup properly lol
DIY,not_removed,my first attempt at any sort of gun leather a friend of mine approached me with a set of specifications arguably the most difficult to implement and ive been itching to have a go at such a thing being a hobbyist shooter myself so i took him up on the request and ran with it what you see here is a fully custom handmade variable cant oclock to oclock right hand outside the waistband left shoulder carry position pancakestyle holster with a security thumbbreak made out of a oz veg tan cowhide leather exterior oz goat suede interior all oil dyed in a rich shade of mahogany for a black beretta not the particular gun in the photo thats just a scale replica i used for the moulding for an initial attempt at this welltrodden form of craft i am absolutely pleased with how it turned out one of the more seamless projects ive ever taken on really i look forward to making more also a quick shoutout to rleathercraft if you wanna see more stuff like this definitely consider roaming over there sometime they wont bite
DIY,not_removed,i like it ive been wanting to try this myself but i lack the tools nicely done
DIY,not_removed,very nice work you made this look easyish how long did this take you from planning to finish
DIY,not_removed,this is beautiful amazing that its a first attempt to whoever is wearing it a local guy shot himself in the leg when the leather near his trigger wore in and put pressure on the trigger randomly check your holster regularly and be careful
DIY,not_removed,thats pretty incredible for a first try curious about the trigger guard area tho it looks like it forms to the trigger itselfany risk of the trigger being grabbed when holstering and the gun going off unexpectedly
DIY,not_removed,great work looks like you have been doing it for years
DIY,not_removed,awesome work however id be careful relying on an airsoft replica vs the real deal
DIY,not_removed,now i see why quality leather holsters are so expensive very nice work
DIY,not_removed,dude that is awesome very nice work i am sure your friend is going to be thrilled with the work youve done i know i would be
DIY,not_removed,it looks great if its just leather it will pull against itself when you try to unsnap it because its not or wont stay rigid enough
DIY,not_removed,interesting is there are particular reason why you chose to put the release button on the inside generally speaking for most holsters with a cover strap you release the strap using a flick of the thumb which you cant do with yours
DIY,not_removed,but can you fit a banana in it
DIY,not_removed,im not a gun guy by any stretch but this is badass great job
DIY,not_removed,that looks great ive seen some great diy holsters now and then makes me regret that in my country firearms may only be transported in a protective case to be used only at a certified gunnery range or previously also approved outdoor property no longer was the leather bought or was it tanned from something you previously hunted very nice either way
DIY,not_removed,awesome job
DIY,not_removed,far too much of an opening on the trigger guard thats begging for a nd i wouldnt consider this holster safe though it is pretty definitely cover that up in the future everything else looks well done
DIY,not_removed,is that an if so how do you like it so far
DIY,not_removed,i shall thanks for reminding me
DIY,not_removed,tools are fairly cheap and theyre completely worth the money do it
DIY,not_removed,maybe hours total from start to finish
DIY,not_removed,duely noted the leather on the top of the trigger is quite stiff at the moment though but will definitely mention to my friend to keep an eye on it
DIY,not_removed,i may be wrong but shouldnt his safety have been on
DIY,not_removed,thanks it was a blast to make well im not really set up to make an assortment of holsters at the moment that would require owning a lot of blue guns to mould with which i do not have p but to answer your question probably around depending on specifics
DIY,not_removed,when pressing against the trigger guard there is very little give its stiff as a bone at the moment over time maybe that will become more broken in and sink around the trigger but i dont see that happening any time soon
DIY,not_removed,ive studied both and they are just about perfect clones probably more accurate than a blue gun just for the fact that it has every bit of detail and functionality as the real thing for testing purposes
DIY,not_removed,i considered this but my snaps wouldnt allow for that kind of thickness so i made do with super hardening the leather itself
DIY,not_removed,maybe you could elaborate on what you mean but this holster works the very way you illustrate as seen in my post httpiimgurcomcjnpnwxgif
DIY,not_removed,thanks for the input and the observation is duely noted will take this into account for future holster creations i got carried away with the moulding on this one
DIY,not_removed,i would agree that ideally the trigger guard should be fully covered but thats far from unsafe ive seen holsters from major brands with worse coverage for sure berettas cant be carried in condition one safety is a decocker so its not like the trigger will ever be resting any further back
DIY,not_removed,the beretta in the photos is just an airsoft replica but its modeled after a the irl beretta is awesome the grip is a bit wider than id like but i love the way it recoils super smooth shooter
DIY,not_removed,perhaps you can make one instead
DIY,not_removed,and you could make holsters for other guns
DIY,not_removed,that is significantly less than i thought awesome
DIY,not_removed,one thing thats often done to alleviate this concern is the have some metal reinforcing the edge so that it cant bend and httpiimgurcomggzydyepng
DIY,not_removed,not every gun has one ive got a couple of revolvers that dont
DIY,not_removed,so basically for your time and no consideration for materials sounds like youre selling yourself short
DIY,not_removed,most holsters have that clip on the outside the reason being is because if that clip is squished between your body and your pistol it becomes more difficult to release we always imagine scenarios where we need a second quick and quiet reaction and the chances of it happening with some holsters are better than others just saying
DIY,not_removed,no problem keep on making holsters because you certainly have a talent for it the trigger guard area is arguably the most important part of the holster as it is what stops the gun from going bang especially with leather as it ages and becomes more pliable this gap will open up even more one other thing you may want to change in the future is creating a sight channel so when you draw there is no hang up from the front site catching on leather to do this you can just use a wood dowel rod to run the length of the gun between the front and back sites and affix it with some painters tape this will also give you a nice straight line along the top of the firearm in the holster which will look a little nicer aesthetically
DIY,not_removed,i look forward to it
DIY,not_removed,that is one unsettling photo but honestly that leather looks far too malleable to be used as a holster but i understand what youre saying
DIY,not_removed,i have a lot of fun working on things like this and dont find a huge profit margin important that said materials are actually cheaper than you think ultimately i ask what i think a piece is worth to me nothing more
DIY,not_removed,httpslmgtfycomtiqthumbbreakholster pretty sure having it on outside would be more of a hazard due to the possibility of catching it on things and accidentally unlocking your firearm
DIY,not_removed,thanks and yea i used a chop stick to manually open up the sight channel during the moulding process but it didnt do too much in the end good thinking on the tape idea
DIY,not_removed,for best results extend the dowel a little past the front sight and carve a slot for the front sight to fit into this will prevent the sight channel from becoming offcentered while you mold it tape only holds so much
DIY,not_removed,typically rip rap is greater than rock any local aggregate producer should have the stone for sale by the bag or by the ton dig out well under the pipe place the filter fabric or geocomposite fabric to prevent sediment from below to work its way up and allow for drainage dependent on the flow of the pipe put at least thick layer of the rip rap to prevent scouring of the outlet area
DIY,not_removed,thanks a ton great info quick q wheres the best place for someone like me to buy this stuff i see a lot of geotextiles at lowes or home depot online but searches for rip rap seem to turn up gravel from quickcrete
DIY,not_removed,yea you might have to search a special company just look up erosion control products and youll come up with suppliers sometimes they are humongous and you might have to pretend you are a serious landscaper but you can get them to make a small sale what said was entirely correct i would stake down the erosion blanket as well with a few staples just to make it easier to start stacking the rip rap its sort of a shitty process almost every stone has to be laid by hand or at least shimmied into place they all have to lock together and you should try to fit the smaller stones in between the bigger stones for the best look if you want to see a shitty job look at the children who built the new panama canal millions of tons of rip rap all put into gabians by hand
DIY,not_removed,i can tell you that a normal tension spring will ruin your fucking day or life if it pops off on your face might want to share a couple pics if you dont see the spring in question
DIY,not_removed,theres an episode of this old house that covers removal of your type of door step by step httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvyvegvjgja
DIY,not_removed,your plan is solid ive dismantled alot of doors of all types years of demolition instead of using blocking to keep a door closed try drilling a hole in the side rail right above one of the castor wheels and insert a bolt that keeps things neater and easier to open from the inside
DIY,not_removed,do not remove these on your own they easily house enough stored energy to kill you at the hardware store i used to work at we wouldnt sell them to anyone who wasnt certified as we had a homeowner have one go clean through their skull while attempting to change one im a journeyman carpenter now and been in the field for years ive never ever worked for a company who would ask their employees to change a spring no matter how shitty the companys attitude towards health and safety was it always gets subbed out to a separate company who specializes in garage doors its well worth paying whatever a company wants to charge to save you from risking your life and limb
DIY,not_removed,this is my greatest concern and why i ask i added some pictures that hopefully help thanks
DIY,not_removed,wow thanks
DIY,not_removed,i appreciate you concern and perhaps i dont understand enough about springs but i can almost free them while the door is down i dont see how they can be dangerous if i just raise the door and lift them off the hook they are on they are more like a worn out slinky than a tightly coiled spring under intense pressure ill be extra careful i might even have a bike helmet around somewhere i can wear while i unhook them
DIY,not_removed,in my opinion that dosent look that dangerous id clip them at the bottom to steer clear of the springs most springs on newer garage doors are wound up tight like that prank peanut shell gag where you open the top and it takes your brain outid do it myself and ive done some really risky stuff
DIY,not_removed,hes talking about the big horizontal spring over the top of the garage door that most houses have do not mess with that it will kill you quick it is very high tension not a diy job
DIY,not_removed,before i looked at the pics i thought no way you should be doing that yourself reason being is i have tension springs and like some mentioned before they can be extremely dangerous however after looking at your pics its clear they arent tension i agree with this guylady above me you should be able to do that yourself
DIY,not_removed,yeah i dont seem to have that on mine just the other springs that attach to the back of the rails
DIY,not_removed,cool cant be stressed enough

DIY,not_removed,disassemble it and sell the wood on cl if it isnt cracked or filled with a ridiculous amount of screws ive found people willing to buy it nothing close to what you paid but it helps
DIY,not_removed,gad you want to do it again youll have to to get it out you did say apartment
DIY,not_removed,i did the same thing except i just tied some ropes around the couch used bathroom rug to prevent damage to the railing and wore myself and my buddy out just pulling it up from the roof and then fished it in with a stick so you know not the same thing at all much harder fucking smart people and their ideas
DIY,not_removed,trebuchet or nothing is what i say
DIY,not_removed,this might be ridiculous but im glad you did it as long as you did it in a way that didnt risk injury to anyone and only risked your couch good for you life is better with random stuff like this

DIY,not_removed,gravity is your friend going the other way heave ho and out it goes
DIY,not_removed,tight hallways short run staircases small door frames i wouldnt count this as rdiwhy
DIY,not_removed,there were reasons i didnt first was worried about the opening being too small its only larger than the smallest dimension of the couch not as much as your average balcony second was the weight of us on the ground with the help of a pulley couldnt pull it up third was it scraping up the side of the building both damaging the couch and damaging the exterior plasterwhatever spray on coating it is
DIY,not_removed,
DIY,not_removed,new potato also needed

DIY,not_removed,this explains everything
DIY,not_removed,all my questions were just answered
DIY,not_removed,another crane guy here if you had of run the single pulley as a moving block it would also have been exactly twice as easy to hoist it up couch attaches to dead end of pulley twice as much rope is pulled upwards but its twice as easy this kind of stuff would be day one of an engineering degree though right
DIY,not_removed,you didnt return everything to home depot afterward
DIY,not_removed,it actually looked pretty well built although i question using rope to lift a load with friction and any bind your safety factor was probably less than which is a little uncomfortable when suspending something like this glad it all worked out though
DIY,not_removed,wasnt really sure if you can rent a forklift even but regardless it is always fun to build something to get something done could tell you are an engineer haha
DIY,not_removed,hes got the gravity assist for the couch removal though
DIY,not_removed,first was worried about the opening being too small just spit on it of us on the ground with the help of a pulley couldnt pull it up add a couple more pulleys and youre good to go could have attached fixed pulleys at the bottom of the railing and back into the bearing members of your absurdly over engineered contraption and been good to go better still just attach the pulleys directly into the joists a small tub of joint compound and a quart of white paint later and you saved yourself beer money for the year third was it scraping up the side of the building both damaging the couch and damaging the exterior plasterwhatever spray on coating it is stucco furniture blankets pool noodles and movers plastic
DIY,not_removed,were they along the line of why would you think this was a good idea
DIY,not_removed,i only have a year diploma originally it was designed so that there would be one guy on the bottom with a tag line and two guys up top pulling the pulley was just to redirect the angle of the force not to lessen the required force i didnt anticipate how heavy it washow weak our grip on the rope was it took seconds to switch the rope over to the van wouldve taken minutes to move the frame back inside take the pulley off the screw rerig it on the couch attach the rope to the frame and move the frame back in place and then we still just have to rely on two guys being able to pull it up totally doable but we just took the easy fast and imo more reliable way pulleys are the way to go if you want to invest more money and dont have horsepower or lots of bodies
DIY,not_removed,well now he can use the lift for his car and park in the living room
DIY,not_removed,hah no wasnt planning on that
DIY,not_removed,yep the rope is probably rated for a static lb load not some bouncybouncy fun n the summertime dynamic load
DIY,not_removed,coming from someone that has used cord to hold much more than at least there was some built in safety
DIY,not_removed,youd be surprised what you can rent never driven a backhoe before just dont mention that to the guy at the rental counter
DIY,not_removed,you can rent anything anything
DIY,not_removed,wasnt really sure if you can rent a forklift even oh lord you can rent a fleet of forklifts if you wanted for a lot less money than you suspect too
DIY,not_removed,not really because theres no way they would do it for as little as the materials cost me
DIY,not_removed,more like this is way too thought out to be stupid but still kinda stupid as somebody who started out as engineering before i changed my mind i like building shit more than i like knowing the science of building shit this is exactly what i wouldve come up with almost too much trouble but worth it just for the confused stares
DIY,not_removed,i only have a year diploma only nothing good for you dude you obviously have some interest in doing this kind of stuff i work with cranes full time and have a keen interest in the technical side of it moreso than any sane person should pm me before your next project and ill give you some pointers
DIY,not_removed,i only have a year diploma oh so day
DIY,not_removed,i rented a front end loader with no experience whatsoever i almost giggled when i drove away there was not as much of a learning curve as i had anticipated
DIY,not_removed,also theres value in solving practical problems if more engineers did more of this thered be fewer engineers doing less of it
DIY,not_removed,yup that about sums it all up
DIY,not_removed,what did you change your major to because im in the same situation right now
DIY,not_removed,bobcats can kill
DIY,not_removed,finance because it still lets me do math just not insane level calc and physics that was killing me slowly
DIY,not_removed,cougars too thats why i always check id before buying a lady a cocktail
DIY,not_removed,from the urban dictionary bobcat a cougar that doesnt really want to do anything but makeout and second base ccktease cougar resembles a wild cat but has little to no wild blood often times a married woman that acts unmarried for isolated incidents but in the end stays faithful for the most part alternative def a young woman between the ages of and who prefers to date men at least years their junior similar to the term cougar referring to single women in their and who date much younger men bobcats are like youngsmall cougars shes going after a year old what a bobcat yikes
DIY,not_removed,nicely done i know others have mentioned the shingles the slope and the bits to cut off but i need to comment on the pen for the garbage cans i have two herniated discs which area pinching my sciatic nerve currently and looking at that pen makes me cringe in pain you aunt or uncle will have to lift a full can up and over that railing those cans can get very heavy and are awkward to try and pick up to any great height do them a big favor and turn the front rails of that pen into a gate by putting hinges on one side and a slide bolt on the other then they can just open the gate to pull the cans out without possibly hurting themselves
DIY,not_removed,nicely done
DIY,not_removed,here come the black widows
DIY,not_removed,how strong is your aunt hope she can lift heavy trash can over the railing
DIY,not_removed,id maybe add a vent just to err on the safe side
DIY,not_removed,you decide to put another side wall up instead of just attaching
DIY,not_removed,looks like you made quite form fitting is it able to hold all kind of potential lawn mower sizes just in case
DIY,not_removed,looks more like a crate
DIY,not_removed,did you leave any space for the wood shingles to expand when they get wet
DIY,not_removed,yeah i need to get over there with the cutoff and do it or just replace the screw lol
DIY,not_removed,its jus tto hold them there when she isnt using them
DIY,not_removed,cant sling it in the mazda yo
DIY,not_removed,i did it just for her size which was a toro
DIY,not_removed,they have a weatherproofing stain on them and they have some wiggle room
DIY,not_removed,so she only takes her trash to the bin right before trash day
DIY,not_removed,the folks at home depot will cut it in half itll easily fit in a compact
DIY,not_removed,nice about as big as they get i think unless someone made one way over the top and its a full feet and a thousand bucks really nice work though sheds great
DIY,not_removed,she has more than these two these are her ones for gardening and such so they will be fine in there until then
DIY,not_removed,my last trip to hd i bought a sheet of plywood for a table im buildingand their saw was out of commish looked like a damn fool with a full sheet hanging out the back of my jeep
DIY,not_removed,anything you use that would be able to soften the wood im afraid would destroy the plastic need to get a longer drill bit
DIY,not_removed,battery acid sulphuric acid would probably do it without dissolving the plastic but it would be more expensive than a new rake actually i think any solution to your problem will be more expensive than a new rake
DIY,not_removed,try pushing a thin flat blade screwdriver in between the plastic and wood the plastic should give way enough to break the glue you may have to do it several times around the diameter if that doesnt work try squeezing the plastic around the wood with a vise or pliers to break the glue bond you could also drill a small hole from the rake end towards the handle and try driving it out with a pin punch
DIY,not_removed,can you shape the end of your new handle to fit in despite this chunk of wood you cant dissolve wood it could be burnt out but obviously not in plastic buy a bigger drill bit and have at it
DIY,not_removed,stump removal chemicals might do it by rotting it out but itll take you weeksmonths for that to happen lol
DIY,not_removed,just buy a new one theyre cheap
DIY,not_removed,have you tried a wood boring bit those things are quite lengthy and only cost other than that kind of hard to say much without a photo or two for ideas on whats wrong using the wood boring bit assuming that the leftover wooden bits are glue in to place and not removable view drilling etc once you have drilled out the center of the wooden bit you will have a standardized hole to fit the next wooden shaft to may need to trim the edges a bit to make the proper size peg to fir the borehole after which use a bit of woodglue to saturate the leftover peg and attach the new shaft to it
DIY,not_removed,liquid plumber ought to do it
DIY,not_removed,have you tried soaking it in boiling water its probably a soft wood the boiling water should make it pliable enough and soften the glue at the same time
DIY,not_removed,if this rake is plastic instead of metal read no further if it is metal this may work put it in a fire it will char then easily be broken up and removed in the old days axe handles and hammers were all done this way if the tool looses temper theyd quench it in water or oil to prevent softening if youre still reading and it is plastic id get a new one sorry
DIY,not_removed,vegetable oil is worth a shot
DIY,not_removed,actually i think any solution to your problem will be more expensive than a new rake damnit was afraid of that lol am going to try to let it soak then dry as someone else suggested then go at it again with a long screwdriver if i dont get it soon will just have to chuck it
DIY,not_removed,battery acid will deteriorate metal and concrete but not wood thats why its recommended that any batteries you have stored are done so on small bits of plywood etc the best answer for the op that i can see is buy a new rake im all for thrifty and diy but cmon draw the line
DIY,not_removed,you could also drill a small hole from the rake end towards the handle and try driving it out with a pin punch youre awesome thank you cant believe i didnt think of that the way its angled this should be simple should allow me to just pop it out d
DIY,not_removed,thanks thats a good idea will give it a shot
DIY,not_removed,that is thinking thank you that sounds like an awesome idea the stuff is sold in a plastic container and afaik itd cut through wood anything cellulose
DIY,not_removed,hey no problem i once found an interesting yo glass beer bottle inside the wall of my house when i was renovating i wanted to clean it up and display it but it had a disgusting dead mouse adhered to the bottom of the bottle inside it took about a week of wondering how the hell i was going to get that mouse out of there when the light bulb finally went on liquid plumber it completely dissolved the mouse in about hours i just poured liquid mouse out into the toilet ugh im getting nauseated just telling you this story but the bottle is spotless inside and is on display atop my kitchen cabinets good luck

DIY,not_removed,do you rent the place
DIY,not_removed,are there any visible electrical wires in the immediate area of the panel inside the wall and out that you can see that would probably be the only thing that would potentially cause a fire in a wall do you have any electrical devices space heaters lights near that wall panel if the answer is no to most of these questions then you should probably be safe in stuffing something in the hole for the time being seeing as is of somewhat an issue for you i would consider the newspaper option since you can get a bunch of that on the cheap its cheap and with enough in the space it can somewhat deaden the sound be aware that even with the hole filled its not a guarantee that you will not hear folks doing the business
DIY,not_removed,ask your parents first but all you really need is a scrap of drywall or plywood and some construction adhesive just glue it over the hole but ask your parents before you do anything
DIY,not_removed,i think it looks great but i cant help but think how much you sacrifice in utility without a square edge id put that in my house and use it as a table instead of a workbench
DIY,not_removed,its my first post on diy i thought you guys would enjoy this i will post a follow up with the finished project
DIY,not_removed,love this table must be heavy like hell where are you going to put it
DIY,not_removed,teach us about this gantry router plane setup
DIY,not_removed,as others have mentioned not having a square edge and the lack of mechanical assistance offered from vices or dog holes for hold fasts will make this a tricky workbench it is however a beautiful assembly table
DIY,not_removed,yeah this not much use of a work bench if you cant get things square also is there any other utility to it than looks now
DIY,not_removed,its going to say right about there until i buy a house yes it is heavy as hell i am building a wood workshop in my basement area i keep getting the living area covered in dust

DIY,not_removed,this looks really nice lovely color
DIY,not_removed,deleted
DIY,not_removed,sooo you made something out of clever
DIY,not_removed,it is not
DIY,not_removed,it needs a drip line but it wount look as pretty
DIY,not_removed,thanks i dont care much for how it would look just want to fix the leak what would that take to install a drip line currently there is a condensate pump in furnace room to pump out some water from system use since there is no drain near furnace
DIY,not_removed,if the furnace has a condensing heat exchanger then it wont be possible to stop all condensation if a furnace has a condensate pump then i believe it almost always has a condensing heat exchanger you have a condensing and a noncondensing appliance vented thought the same vent that sucks typically a condensing furnace would be vented with pvc and the extra condensate that dropped in the vent line would either drip back down to the condensate pump or drip out of the vent edit or is the water heater condensing too
DIY,not_removed,make sure that the vent cap or cover outside isnt restricting the air flow
DIY,not_removed,if its hi efficiency its condensing usually side wall vented if your water heater and furnace are connected and its vented up a chimney you are non condensing your problem is your chimney isnt keeping the gas hot enough to reach the top of them chimney its cooling and creating acidic moisture get it looked at before your liner if you have one will eat away and then the acid will start to do the same to the mortar and bricks my just be a case of dropping a smaller liner to keep the gas hot enough to escape
DIY,not_removed,the furnace is vented with type b gas vent there is a smaller pvc line that feeds to condensate unit how do i determine whether hwh is condensing type it is an older ao smith gas variety if it matters
DIY,not_removed,it goes through that wall to the chimney and vents through the chimney
DIY,not_removed,if it doesnt have a condensate pump then its not condensing if its got a draft hood at the exhaust rather than a direct connection its also not condensing basically noncondensing appliances are supposed to operate hot enough that the flue system dries off by the time the heating cycle is over and condensing appliances are supposed to operate cold enough that the flue system can be sealed maybe a pro installer knows a trick to make them play nice but as a random homeowner my impression is that they arent really meant to work together maybe theres a venting system thats heatresistant enough to work with the noncondensing appliance and also sealed to work with the condensing furnace frankly having a forced draft appliance the furnace and an induced draft appliance the noncondensing water heater sounds like a co hazard to me since the forced draft might be backflowing out of the draft hood the whole time but now im just completely speculating
DIY,not_removed,is it a fan powered vent
DIY,not_removed,it is non condensing then because their is a draft hood or open space between hwh and vent pipe what shall i do next
DIY,not_removed,i think you need a professional anything i do would be improvised at best
DIY,not_removed,it took about hours to build this cat door and for me it was essentially free since i just used wood scraps
DIY,not_removed,very nice work but man your doors have so much clearance on the bottom doesnt it draft in your house heat loss is probably a pain too unless you live in a warmer climate than i do then its not that big of a deal edit words
DIY,not_removed,lolthe interior doors do have a lot of clearance on them when i bought the house they had just torn out the carpet to reveal the hardwood floors at some point they must have cut the doors down to make room for carpeting
DIY,not_removed,for a soft wood like cedar or pine you might get away with it practice on some scrap first generally a hacksaw has a lot of twist in it when pushing the blade depending on how much tension is on it when tightened in the frame right tool for the job is the best way to go dovetail saws have broad spines for a reason

DIY,not_removed,tape a strip of wood to the underside of your circular saw base right next to the blade this will tilt the entire saw so the blade is tipped outward youll have to experiment with the thickness of the block and the blade depth so it exactly cuts at the edge of the wall and of course the cut will be beveled a little
DIY,not_removed,i agree with ujakkarth a single blade two at most of an oscillating saw will finish the job provided your proclaimed is accurate the only bladediminishing factor is the nails but you wont be cutting nearly as many as you might think by the way take a lot of pictures and make a contribution on rdiy if you havent already create a free account on httpwwwimgurcom to upload your work and caption your photos also disconnect power to that portion of your house please dont electrocute yourself good luck
DIY,not_removed,jambsaw or saw at all fine toolhire locations a good carbide blade will cut right through any nails it finds the toekick saw will want to kick when it first finds one though
DIY,not_removed,the oscillating saw is your best bet as far as i can tell from your description it should go pretty quickly but you may want to pick up an extra blade in case the first gets dull before the job is done
DIY,not_removed,cant get close enough with a circular saw why not can you post pics
DIY,not_removed,something like this or a long blade on a sawzall takes some skill and wont come out perfectly
DIY,not_removed,if you are cutting an inset groove etc i did exactly that with an oscillating tool was also on a sunroom i had car siding i used on the walls it abutted the original redwood siding around foot total of coot it was not fun but ok also used old crappy wood chisels to clean out lucky as i only hit a few nails
DIY,not_removed,buy a good quality blade ie lenox cmt ect for the job youll get better results than the cheaper blades at the big box store
DIY,not_removed,lots of demo guys just cut right through live wires the tool is insulated and the breakers throw whenever there is a hit good times
DIY,not_removed,once you discover that the oscillating saw is one of your favorite goto tools youll always have a selection of blades
DIY,not_removed,and for those interested here it is
DIY,not_removed,friend of mine had a particular assortment of things that he wanted bundled up in his front pocket and this was my solution the design enables front pocket fitment for use with a keyport slide and an expandable cardcash storage area let me know what you think thanks
DIY,not_removed,wow this is amazing i wish i could make this great job
DIY,not_removed,awesome any info on the cutter used
DIY,not_removed,starbucks gift card whitegirlstatus
DIY,not_removed,thanks and i firmly believe you too could do this
DIY,not_removed,i tend to source my leather from trusted sellers on ebay theres always a good selection and fair prices to be had checkout distantdrums or loadsofleather on ebay theyve been great for me as far as thickness seek out a quick chart online that gives you a millimeter to ounce conversion and go from there like httpwwwrusticleathercomleatherthicknesscharthtml
DIY,not_removed,hahaha indeed was honestly just the most noncompromising card i had at the time to use as a frontfacing place holder that thing has had like on it for years couldnt tell ya why i havent gotten rid of it yet
DIY,not_removed,great job
DIY,not_removed,forgive me for my noob question as a beginner to woodworking what are the benefits of a crosscut sled vs miterchop saw i own both anyway just wondering i know of main reasons itd be better safer to cut small stock w crosscut easier repeatable cuts with small stock what are some other reasons
DIY,not_removed,your sled doesnt seem to allow for a higher blade adjustment be careful you dont cut your rails all the way through the top
DIY,not_removed,nice i just built one almost identical to this this and a jointer taper jig and youre in good shape to produce some serious projects
DIY,not_removed,love it i have a smaller craftsman job site kind that i inherited and have started using it im going to have to build one of these question regarding the insert did you make that or buy it im having a heck of a time trying to find one that fits my model great build
DIY,not_removed,thank you
DIY,not_removed,you can cut anything wider than or or whatever your miter saw cut width is
DIY,not_removed,its not just for small stock i am able to cut much wider boards than i am able to with my miter saw wide panel no problem even with a sliding miter saw i dont think you can get that length of cut i know my table saw to be dead on nuts degrees to the table surface for this reason i more accurate cuts on the table saw vs the miter saw hell i prefer to use my table saw for miters as well chop saw is fine for getting close but when i need dead on accuracy i fire up the table saw as long as you tune it when you first get it you will do fine
DIY,not_removed,correct i dont use the sled for anything that thick i think i could do a panel at the most
DIY,not_removed,the miter gauge i made that these larger saws all have pretty standard miter gauges job site saws may have less conventional dimensions for miter slots might have to make them
DIY,not_removed,the zero clearance insert actually cheers
DIY,not_removed,and now i googled and it looks like theyre now readily available i swear when my dad first got the saw a few years back couldnt find any
DIY,not_removed,oh good deal forgot that pic was in there glad you found one
DIY,not_removed,the easiest cheapest thing is to just live them as they are now the next might be to just polyurethane the plywood

DIY,not_removed,easiest most durable pick one head over to rfinishing and rwoodworking those peeps can recommend something better than home depot polycrylic
DIY,not_removed,ive had fairly good results with polycrylic the only thing is that if you have a hot or hard object sitting on it for a long time it might stick to the coating even years after the coating has dried however its easy and cheap to refinish every few years if your coaster discipline is lax other than that it will last a really long time even better though would be an oil based polyurethane finish or old school lacquer
DIY,not_removed,fair enough haha was kinda expecting that from someone i appreciate the linked subs ill see what i can drum up and ill probably go with most durable would rather do the work right and once
DIY,not_removed,see that is a concern as it will be used frequently and i cant say i have ever used a coaster though we might start and what i do here will be the ground work for the separate kitchen island and a office desk i am building i would do a lacquer but was concerned about the process and toxicity not only is it potent but you have to use a torch to get bubbles out and you have to be careful with layering which seems like extra work for what i seek to accomplish at this time essentially i want the easiest and most durable method for finishing a tabletop that will be used while keeping it clear to show the hardwood i dont mind extra work i just want it done sooner rather than later is all thanks
DIY,not_removed,thanks for the info man i sent a reply to the pm you sent me
DIY,not_removed,you might look into oil treatments rather than finishes that will definitely allow the wood to show front and center and refinishing is easy reoil infrequently and sand back any stains over the years and reoil its a pretty good working surface if your main concern is utility rather than having a gloss sheen look into cutting board finishes for example
DIY,not_removed,yeah i am fairly new to finishingtreating wood surfaces as in i have never done it before haha so its a learning curve and one that i will do research on before moving forward just trying to find the best route for this tabletop i think ill go with either polycrylic semi gloss water based or just going full bore and use a gloss super glaze lacquer kit but am still researching thanks for your feedback

DIY,not_removed,why not just leave the outside thats there now and add the pillow protector to them depending on the type of down you might get feathers poking through if the pillow protectors arent made to be downfilled
DIY,not_removed,thanks for this i find it unsettling knowing the slightly yellow fabric is somewhere out the lurking below my face at night
DIY,not_removed,actually more to it than that i did this years ago and consulted with a master electrician before hand use dual cual compatible outlets use dual compatible murettes once you have a connection pigtailed use noalox on the pigtail and then put the murrette on thus prevents over heating which results in fire
DIY,not_removed,not only that if you go ramming timers and dimmers into existing junction boxes with pigtails youre likely going to have a box fill issue this can be dangerous because of a lack of heat dissipation especially with dimmers
DIY,not_removed,awesome thanks the pigtails are already installed with the special marettes so the rest should be easy
DIY,not_removed,technically the noalox prevent oxidation of the aluminum which in turn prevents highresistance connections due to the oxidation any highresistance connections will get hot enough to cause a fire over time any time aluminum wiring is worked with it needs to be scraped shiny and noaloxed before being reconnected
DIY,not_removed,btw this the best answer i had a look inside the box and space is definitely an issue im not comfortable jamming a timer in there thanks
DIY,not_removed,also remember that aluminum will expand and contract more than copper so be careful that your connections are not lose or they will loosen themselves more and you will have arcing

DIY,not_removed,this is a link to a photo album of some sawhorses i designed and built the plans are included in the link as well
DIY,not_removed,im no expert but my first thought would be to cover it with masking tape or painters tape then hulk smash and peel it off this is probably not the best idea that said prying on a small part of it will cause it to shatter if it is even remotely firmly anchored
DIY,not_removed,tricky part is how its attached ive used an engineers steel rule to slide in behind and break double sided taped mirrors but never anything this large the rulers are stainless steel and have a crisp sharp edge they come in various lengths for draftspeople as well if it were glued with silicone perhaps the heat from a steam cleaner would soften it up through contact with the glass
DIY,not_removed,use a big rock
DIY,not_removed,i think that mirror might be held on by the aluminum trim on the edges maybe if you do have to break it up maybe use cheap adhesive drawer liner instead of tape better coverage finally be very careful a chunk of glass falling from feet is final destination material actually looking at your photo im guessing feet is the actual height unless your house was built by m c escher
DIY,not_removed,i can tell you a little about how it is probably hung i worked as a carpenters helper through a lot of high school and a few years of college we hung quite a few mirrors some as large as usually we used streaks of liquid nails to hold the glass to the wall and screwed up temporary wooden trim to hold it in place while it set we never mounted them using mortar or cement for anything larger than about a square foot i was told the mortar wouldnt set evenly and would result in cracking the glass or peeling the coating off the back have you considered scoring it with a glass cutter to control breakage and chunk sizes you were definitely right about taping the mirror up as much as possible it will be your only real shot at minimizing cuts oh and they make cutproof gloves that you can use to handle the shards when you take them to the dumpster
DIY,not_removed,safest way is to call a professional glass company second safest way is with a suction cup and a glass cutter funnest way is to throw hammer at it but its a mess to clean up if you diy be extremely careful because as glass ages it gets brittle and shatters in strange and unexpected ways
DIY,not_removed,ok i did this before let me tell you what we learned cautionary story in our case the mirror was about wide and tall surprise the mirror was not attached to the wall with anything other than the visible fasteners when we removed the fasteners we foolishly thought it was going to stay attached to the wall it did not in fact after about seconds it suddenly started to fall forward off of the wall my mother happened to be standing right there facing away and did not see this happening i was also standing right there and managed to stop the mirror right before it hit her head and it had fallen almost degrees i thought it broke my wrists because it hit me so hard i almost fell down from the force the mirror did not break incredibly considering how much stress i must have put on the middle i also discovered it weighed a lot more than i thought i could not hold the weight of the mirror by myself and im not a little guy and lbs and was starting to lose it my father stepped in and helped hold it it was so heavy and large we could not lift it back up and could not lower it down with just the two of us my mother literally ran to the next door neighbors and got two guys to help us we finally managed to lower it safely but holy shit that could have killed someone my suggestions hire someone seriously pay them or so and be done with it its not even worth the time and effort you will go through okay you want to diy heres what i would do buy two pieces of plywood cut x so they fit in the middle and use them to help reinforce and safely handle the mirror tape or glue them to the mirror this will minimize the chance of breaking may allow you to remove it its designed to remove countertops do not let it break that will be a disaster its either going to be a minute job or an hour cleanup worse it may break and slice someone and put you in the hospital now you have a hazmat cleanup too expect the mirror to suddenly fall off the wall when you are working on it expect it to weigh a lot more than you thought easily pounds in my opinion a mirror that large you will be glad you have people helping buy of each they are cheap and tremendously helpful you should have some sort of ladders setup on each side that will safely allow someone to walk the mirror down on each side put down a thick nonslippery nontrip coveringtarp just in case and get rid of anything nearby good luck
DIY,not_removed,put down heavy tarps wear long pants boots heavy sweatshirt gloves full face mask break the fuck out of it
DIY,not_removed,hammer duct tape
DIY,not_removed,its hard to overstate the benefit of beating the hell out of it with a hammer but if theres some reason you dont want to do that you might try pulling some sort of cutting wire down the wall between the wall and the mirror another thought would be since the wall is not flammable to use nichrome or something to burn through the adhesive or tape or whatevers holding it to the wall
DIY,not_removed,this is probably your best option i had to remove a mirror that was attached with some type of adhesive we purchased the cheapest aluminum straight edge that was larger than the glass and sharpened one side working it back and forth did the trick of cutting through the adhesive
DIY,not_removed,will it come off in one piece like this if we are careful or will it likely break no matter what
DIY,not_removed,when i have debadged cars in the past ive used fishing wire behind them fishing line might be a viable option here considering the size
DIY,not_removed,so the aluminum trim is pretty misleading from the picture in person the trim is actually coming off the mirror i think it is more there to cover the sharp edge of the mirror in any event the trim is definitely not what is holding it to the wall it appears to be some sort of adhesive what kind exactly i am not sure
DIY,not_removed,thank you for your response mirror destruction is totally okay i think wed like to minimize the mess but zero concern for the the well being of the mirror i believe it is glued with the mirrored support pieces that you can sort of see in the picture helping as well when you say break it do you mean make sure we do the taping and get ourselves situated properly and then just smash the heck out of it
DIY,not_removed,i worked for a glass company for years definitely no pro in this line of work but ive had plenty experience with these types of mirrors id encourage not breaking it up as mentioned by prior posters its most likely plate glass if pieces drop theyll explode into tiny pieces and scatter about the room using suction cups and a glass cutter wear long sleeve shirt and pants heavy duty gloves and goggles and start at the top and work your way down to prevent pieces falling on you or slamming down like a guiltein obviously calling a professional can be an expense that youre not wanting to spend money on yet far cheaper than having a chunk of glass removed from your arm or leg if you do plan to do it yourself make sure someone is there to assist and be patient good luck
DIY,not_removed,works a treat but takes patience
DIY,not_removed,ive gotten some big ones off in one piece using the steel rule method gently using a sawing motion the blade cuts through double sided tape or silicone easily just takes time is all as it lifts use something as wedge to keep tension on the mirror that makes it easier to manipulate the rule and gives access as you go wadded newspaper folded up to make wedges kind of thing
DIY,not_removed,piano wire works well too
DIY,not_removed,exactly its not something you can rush through and expect favorable results
DIY,not_removed,i was reading the comments and saw the liquid nails one yeah thats a killer no choice but to break it if thats the case
DIY,not_removed,yeah if its that stuff youre screwed like someone else suggested use several layers of shelf paper to keep it mostly in one piece
DIY,not_removed,liquid nails will destroy the silver and be visible so will silicone
DIY,not_removed,not all silicone is the same theres acetic cure and neutral cure types you use neutral cure on mirrors its quite common especially for wet area setups and doesnt affect the metalized backing cheers
DIY,not_removed,thats new to me thanks
DIY,not_removed,handy to know youre welcome
DIY,not_removed,hey guys thanks for checking out the project got a couple of questions about where i sourced the movement hands etc i bought them from esslingercom but there are a number of other websites that supply parts for watch repair people heres my list of things i bought thick diameter quartz from epson very cheap it comes with a stem hands i bought a bunch of different colours from esslinger to try them out just have to match the sizes specified in the datasheet httpwwwesslingercomgscrystalhypocementwatchcrystalglue
DIY,not_removed,meche from canada awesome work too im jealous and will have to add this to my list of things to think about doing
DIY,not_removed,incredible work fantastic watch some people may complain about using quartz movement but that is because they have fallen for the misconception that a watch is about the movement this is an opinion common with those new to watches your watch is what a watch is about style unique design personality the movement is mass produced in of all watches anyway it is generic and quartz simply works better you made a lot of good choices here very impressed i would buy one in a heartbeat
DIY,not_removed,final product looks sleek and smart and still has a lot of character love it im a little picky about what kind of watch id wear but id totally wear this the coppery metallic finish of the dial makes it for me great job
DIY,not_removed,this is absolutely gorgeous and of the nicest things ive seen on this sub colour of the face with the minimalist hands is beautiful youve inspired me to start looking for friends with machine rooms
DIY,not_removed,nice job
DIY,not_removed,awesome project
DIY,not_removed,fantastic work i cant imagine there would be much else more satisfying than wearing such a stylish watch know you crafted it with your own two hands
DIY,not_removed,make me one seriously make me one
DIY,not_removed,have you considered doing a high gloss blue like a gun finish on the steel
DIY,not_removed,that is a gorgeous watch very nicely made too
DIY,not_removed,you could sell those easily
DIY,not_removed,quality stuff this lovely use of the section feature in solidworks too
DIY,not_removed,rwatches
DIY,not_removed,haha you can tell by the ring eh
DIY,not_removed,thanks so much
DIY,not_removed,appreciate the kind words im pretty lucky to have an amateur machinist friend d
DIY,not_removed,i did think about a few different possibilities for finishing both the case and the dial i was seriously considering oil blackening and using ferric chloride but ended up sticking with the raw waxed steel which i like a lot a gun metal finish would be undoubtedly rad im more of a fan of a dullmatte finish than gloss but ill keep experimenting
DIY,not_removed,the blueing that clickspring on youtube does is very impressive
DIY,not_removed,haha thanks appreciate it
DIY,not_removed,haha thanks appreciate it
DIY,not_removed,thanks
DIY,not_removed,yessir dead giveaway i wish the states were more serious about it and i doubt any in the us would choose metric for a personal project
DIY,not_removed,yeah man the end result looks great im jealous that you have access to a friend with a machine shop

DIY,not_removed,thank you reddit
DIY,not_removed,from my welding experience your design is actually overkill for to pounds i would feel comfortable standing on the upper shelf with six supports underneath it if you are the sort of person who wants it supported no matter what then you could incorporate some gussets at the corners of your braces but that is really overkill
DIY,not_removed,so good to see a question posted with so much detail made understanding the question easy for a change haha not that i have a huge knowledge of how much weight this could take if you made it to the specs of your drawing but one thing that could help is if you welded small spines to the vertical and top horizontal piece i see this bending on the vertical and horizontal steel so both need to be braced if you at least added a spine to the back of the vertical piece then you wouldnt see it you could then put a corner bracket in the top corner and you most likely wouldnt see that either interested to see what other people say about the gauge of steel that would hold this up without brackets hopefully the steel alone will do the job thatd make life a lot easier and it would look a lot better
DIY,not_removed,well i guess glad to know it would have worked very well rather than failed had i just done it do you have any suggestions on improving the design in that case to make it a little more appropriate cost effective or easy to make perhaps less braces all together or a thinner steeldifferent kind of metal altogether like aluminium or something like that
DIY,not_removed,glad to know my little visualizations helped as the other commenter has noted what i have sounds like it will be massive overkill so the possibility of just using the cs themselves is sounding good so far i thought about the corner bracket idea too and that seems like a good compromise if it ends up having to happen honestly it might just depend on who i manage to get to physically make them half chance is it will be some random connection to a pro welder type person half chance it might end up as a welding student at my schools industrial design department hopefully a few more people with welding experience and the ability to estimate this kind of stuff show up here too thanks
DIY,not_removed,how about creating your upper shelf and use some of these quick easy and they look good as well
DIY,not_removed,very nice i looked for some premade solutions but thats probably the best looking one so far though really ive sold myself on trying to figure out a solution for a floating shelf just for the uniqueness factor of it and the satisfaction of learning how to make design and make something like that myself with some help
DIY,not_removed,ok just thought youd want to see it good luck on your project please post some pictures when you get done im sure itll look great
DIY,not_removed,absolutely thanks for the suggestion i will make sure to share when its done
DIY,not_removed,sump pumpalso french drain around housedont forget carbon monixed alarms
DIY,not_removed,it should not be a problem but that depends on what part of the world you live in the farther north you go the colder the winters are northern hemisphere of course if you have failed to close the vents to your crawl space this will make the water heater far more susceptible to being exposed to cold temperatures that may burst the pipe going to it the water heater should be up on blocks and the emergency drain should be routed to outside the house neither of these being under the house is a deal breaker it is fairly common just makes it harder to change the filters if they are inside the unit get a filter grill for the furnace inside the house where the duct return is
DIY,not_removed,a little late but ask your attorney to draw up an addendum to the contract stating that the seller will pay to have both the furnace and water heater installations brought up to current code i am sure that the water heater installation would not be allowed maybe even the furnace
DIY,not_removed,this depends on so many factors i have a crawlspace with gas furnace and water heater and i have no problems whatsoever but im not in a flood zone and ive already taken measures to reduce the risk of excess watermoisture in the crawlspace and garage if the question is does the combination of a crawlspace and gas furnace and gas water heater equal certain doom then the answer is a flat no
DIY,not_removed,ah the old pay now or pay me later scenario
DIY,not_removed,it very much depends how tall is this crawl space is it crawling on your belly or just walking bent over are there vents in the crawl space are the joists sound and dry if you go under there i would not buy a house without crawling around the crawlspace first you should be able to see any signs of water damage or of frequent wetting water stains look near entrances vents corners etc depending on your situation you might be able to ask the seller to install new vapor barrier if theres a small amount of moisture there an automatic dehumidifier can take care of small amounts of moisture if it is an unvented crawlspace as others mention you definitely must have carbon monoxide alarms in the living area you can get combo smoke alarmcarbon monoxide alarm units i intentionally moved my hot water heater out of the kitchen thereby gaining a pantry into the crawlspace in my place but i have a pretty tall space with vapor barrier and a dehumidifier which is automatic and drains into the plumbing drainline so i never have to empty it we sat the water heater atop some pavers so it isnt directly on the vapor barrier the positive is that if when the water heater ever leaks someday all that water is in the crawlspace not flooding the floor the only issue was finding a short and fat water heater instead of the customary tall skinny models it is really about how much water is getting in there i lived in a rental with a small stream running across the basement floor when it rained hard that would take serious french drains and sealing the exterior walls at minimum
DIY,not_removed,there is a sump pump thankfully and im a stickler for alarms thanks
DIY,not_removed,thank you for the info we live in nj it definitely gets cold but not as bad as further north we did go there to check it out it looks like it got a little bit of water though nothing is standing which was impressive based on the amount of rain we got last night the heater appears to be on a concrete slab but the water heater is right on the ground with sandbags around it which i thought was a little weird i guess thats what inspections are for
DIY,not_removed,also do you have any thoughts on air quality
DIY,not_removed,good idea my main concern is safetyair quality so all of that can be addressed in the contract
DIY,not_removed,thank you what measures did you specifically take it seems to be a bit damp down there
DIY,not_removed,you just have to accept youll be removing water from the basementcrawlspace periodically if it gets a little now the problem will get worse i lived in a house with basement and crawlspace we got water in it it wasnt that big of a deal my parents solution was to send me down there with a wet vac in big storms when i was small we would just get a little dripping by the time i was we were getting inches to a foot we tried french drains and other solutions but if water is getting into the basement youve gotta get it fixed or youll be dealing with it all your life the time to do that is now get a contractor in there and ask how much it will cost for something that will solve the problem for years or permanently factor that into your costs because it is a or more problem how old is the house has the foundation settled ask the contractor if you should expect more cracking or leaks to appear that may have to be fixed after this repair just know what youre getting into if youre ok with the cost of this and future repairs plus and inflation for what those repairs will cost in years go for it if you really love the house that said all homes in pa and nj have water problems if the basement isnt maintained properly just get ahead of the problems before they become maintenence nightmares and so you dont have to be down there during every storm cleaning up the water
DIY,not_removed,if you have water you will have mold in a crawlspace if you have mold allergies you can try to get some natural or artificial uv light down there somehow to keep it at bay though most people wouldnt bother
DIY,not_removed,the furnace is supposed to be a closed system with the house the only air that goes through it is from the inside of the house the actual firebox of the gas furnace does not draw fresh air to or from this system and heats an exchanger that the house air runs through this is not to say that the ducting has not gotten old and sprung a few leaks but it should be for the most part okay i cannot tell you for certain i cant see it for myself a good home inspector which most loans now require should be able to tell you what is going on there the water heater should not be sitting directly on the ground the sandbags are probably to keep water from getting to it even still ground contact will cause the bottom to rust off of the shell and possibly the feet it should instead be sitting on top of bricks or better cinder blocks
DIY,not_removed,nothing major for me my home inspection revealed minor moisture buildup in one section of the crawlspace so i redid the moisture barrier regraded mulch and stuff around the perimeter of the house and added extensions to the downspouts to divert rainwater further from the house ive lived here for just over two years and havent had any signs of trouble and ive gone into the crawlspace and not found any trace of moisture
DIY,not_removed,that sounds like a nightmare that i dont want to deal with a huge part of the reason this house was desirable in the first place was because of the price and adding on top of that makes it not that great of a deal i think it might be time to go back to the drawing board
DIY,not_removed,i dont but theres definitely a smell to the home thats a bit bothersome
DIY,not_removed,thanks for the info i wonder if what im smelling in there is coming up through the floorboards
DIY,not_removed,thanks for the info after looking at it it appears pretty wet it might not work for us
DIY,not_removed,for lazy the sign on the fridge just because this fridge is stocked with soda and you are down here without parental supervision does not mean you get to drink it whenever you want stay out
DIY,not_removed,yes they were sealed no you dont have to ask the pictures clearly show they were sealed
DIY,not_removed,its funny how these basement bars are making a comeback i remember loads of houses having those leather padded bars in the basement and everyone eventually ripping them out
DIY,not_removed,fantastic work
DIY,not_removed,i use that you can tell by the way that it is all the time but never knew where it came from did a little search to find the neature walk video that is pure gold thanks for naming your bar after those ferocious biting goats so that i could get curious and laugh oh and sweet bar
DIY,not_removed,bar looks great and i love the chalk boards my favorite part is the proportioned drawn on the menu
DIY,not_removed,i love the glass this is the one to give to the least liked guest
DIY,not_removed,very nice the penny top is awesome
DIY,not_removed,the pole in the middle of the bar really brings it all together i really hate it at establishments and they seem to always get in the way but when i saw it here i really liked it
DIY,not_removed,what are the penny bets
DIY,not_removed,not only did you build a bar but you finished your basement i really like the penny pattern on the bar top nice job all around
DIY,not_removed,op did you lift weights in the corner between each step of the build so you can be the bouncer to your own bar
DIY,not_removed,took a small detour to make myself some nice tumblers thats a mighty nice detour i can totally see drinking a nice bourbon out of one of those im wondering how hard it is to do that kind of acidetching read could i do that or are my chops too crappy
DIY,not_removed,thats a really sweet bar lots of nice touches and looks great hope you enjoy hanging out there and make lots of good memories
DIY,not_removed,are you thinking about installing a tap somewhere
DIY,not_removed,amazing job i built an outdoor one earlier this summer and fully appreciate the amount of work that goes into this kind of project outstanding work
DIY,not_removed,looks fantastic did you just sort pennies by color to get the diamond effect or did you treat them with something
DIY,not_removed,op this is awesome nice job what sealant did you use for the pennies we lost a lot of our awesome basement bar in a flood currently rebuilding and i want to affix pictures of good times in the old basement to the bar top not sure what to use
DIY,not_removed,now time to make a fullblown mancave
DIY,not_removed,you didnt have a plan looks fabulous
DIY,not_removed,dude this bar looks awesome at first glance i was thinking what a nice concept then started scrolling down pics and became more intrigued with every passing photo great work
DIY,not_removed,you can tell its a bar by the way it is danke meme op pretty neat
DIY,not_removed,its refreshing to see some diy furniture not made of pallets
DIY,not_removed,
DIY,not_removed,i love to drink in fact ive taken so far as to be a raging alcoholic but ive never understood the point of building a bar at home do you stand behind it and wash glasses while you talk to your friends it seems like the kind of thing that sounds cool hypothetically but would be really useless in real life with that said nice job building it it looks great
DIY,not_removed,the blackboard is a nice touch i have a bar in progress and did a pallet wall behind the bar might have to frame out a spot and do a blackboard too good idea
DIY,not_removed,you did a fabulous job
DIY,not_removed,excellent use of an awkwardly placed supporting beam
DIY,not_removed,i read that as i built a car in my basement and was wondering how you were gonna drive it
DIY,not_removed,this is the post that reminded me that i should do something with my day
DIY,not_removed,i hope you have a sink or a dishwasher nearby
DIY,not_removed,well done man this bar looks amazing and a very good first try i love the top i actually build and fit bars for a living if you were still wanting to put some bottles on display you should look into an optic rail
DIY,not_removed,oh wow score hopefully with a bar like that you can get a little closer to nature but you also gotta be careful thats why id recommend packin he pack a gun just pack some heat now not much of a big boy you dont wanna kill the animal but you do wanna warn it and say hey i think youre pretty neat but i respect your distance
DIY,not_removed,you should add hooks under the bar so people can hang their coats there all the shady places ive been to have those
DIY,not_removed,that is a god damn masterpiece
DIY,not_removed,i am envious understatement
DIY,not_removed,might need to expand your menu a bit
DIY,not_removed,bro can i come hang out my new best friend
DIY,not_removed,awesome job when does happy hour start
DIY,not_removed,somarried
DIY,not_removed,that penny design for the bar top may be the coolest bar top ive ever seen
DIY,not_removed,neat
DIY,not_removed,looks great idea put strips of leds behind the shot glasses on the three shelves theyre hidden in shadow right now bonus points if you use fully addressable leds and hook them up to an arduino
DIY,not_removed,this is the most beautiful thing ive ever seen
DIY,not_removed,now you have your own tavern without the markup on alcohol
DIY,not_removed,that cool penny idea you found online was my penny floor wasnt it httpimgurcomyycyldj
DIY,not_removed,i dream of one day having a modest house of my own with a basement that i can do things like this with a happy family you are living my highest dream
DIY,not_removed,somehow it reminds me of that family guy episode where peter also made a bar in his basement
DIY,not_removed,i love that stain color solid work bro
DIY,not_removed,but its got a bar nitz in the basement
DIY,not_removed,beautiful i love the chalkboards
DIY,not_removed,next project is to build a basement in your basement bar a basement bar bar basement
DIY,not_removed,i like everything about this emily needs to get her act together and pull up out of last place
DIY,not_removed,due to a comment im guessing the penny bet is round about
DIY,not_removed,damn top post on diy and its not a catastrophic failure for not planning anything out this is one really nice bar might have to consider making one once i become a homeowner if i ever do
DIY,not_removed,now if i only had friends
DIY,not_removed,so what did mom say when she discovered this
DIY,not_removed,is this in the midwest it seems to be a popular idea there
DIY,not_removed,that penny counter top is awesome great idea and execution
DIY,not_removed,super cool man great work
DIY,not_removed,nice barasement buildobro
DIY,not_removed,thats a nice bar
DIY,not_removed,i really like it im a cabinet designer and id like to give you points for using an outlet cover that matches the wood one of my pet peeves is beautiful woodwork with a bigass white plastic outlet cover in the middle of it i couldnt tell from the pic but your mini fridge doesnt seem to have a vent at the bottom if it vents out of the back it will have a shorter lifespan from being enclosed
DIY,not_removed,great job especially if youve little experience im the same and looking for a project to do would be over the moon of it turned out this well
DIY,not_removed,if you paid someone to make that it would have cost you even more though thats what i tell myself when i build things
DIY,not_removed,wasnt trying to be mean i can be your friend 😔
DIY,not_removed,i think you took like every hack element one could want in a home bar from rdiy sans neon and made it into something awesomely cheesy great job looks fantastic

DIY,not_removed,wife wont let you go out anymore huh
DIY,not_removed,nice work it looks great im curious if the panels on the front of the bar are actually set back or is it just the trim on the front that gives it that look

DIY,not_removed,excellent job top work
DIY,not_removed,nice now if only i had the social life to justify building a bar in my house
DIY,not_removed,that bar is nice
DIY,not_removed,not a bar before it contains a bottle of angostura bitter
DIY,not_removed,because my alcoholism won
DIY,not_removed,every good bar has an awkward support beam it gives them character
DIY,not_removed,how do people do shit like this please how
DIY,not_removed,what a nice project please post some pictures when you are having a party its so sad that ppl often dont show pictures of using the things they build and just post the clean and finished version

DIY,not_removed,i just want to thank you for allowing someones dad to write the copy for your sign you are doing gods work

DIY,not_removed,maybe its just the picture but the upper shelf with the shot glasses looks very dark the blue lighting thats underneath the bar in the first photo would look good up there
DIY,not_removed,now you need live music and your all set
DIY,not_removed,ive thought about building a bar in my basement theres even a quartercircle tiled corner thats about by on which id situate it but ive held off because no water or drain basement has a sewage lift pump but id have to sawcut the concrete floor and dig in order to reach it i didnt see a sink or drain how does that affect your bar im assuming you have to drag everything up to the kitchen to wash it or you have to use a bathroom in your basement to to wash glasses
DIY,not_removed,yea well i was able to get my doors to stop creaking thank you very much
DIY,not_removed,where the tap
DIY,not_removed,very nice well done
DIY,not_removed,badass i like the penny top but the few extras on top would drive me crazy haha

DIY,not_removed,wish i could own a bar just not profitable
DIY,not_removed,nice work
DIY,not_removed,thats beautiful good job
DIY,not_removed,i just dont see the appeal of putting pennies in the bartop especially since you could use some kind of really nice looking wood for pretty cheap
DIY,not_removed,ack what is the line you can tell its a bar from the way it is from its driving me nuts love the bar man great job
DIY,not_removed,play a bar sound effect to make it complete httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvbcnjoaxyfgg

DIY,not_removed,hi i was wondering how many sqft your bar area is nice job thanks
DIY,not_removed,how did you keep the pennies from moving after you put them down and before you put the sealant down
DIY,not_removed,love that you stayed away from that granitestainless bullshit played out so bad just me but no way id choose that combo in
DIY,not_removed,that looks like such a sick place to be a fucking alcoholic i love it
DIY,not_removed,lookin sharp

DIY,not_removed,definitely needs beer or something on tap

DIY,not_removed,well done
DIY,not_removed,rogers place
DIY,not_removed,you mind describing the glass etching process what kind of acid did you use
DIY,not_removed,wow great job
DIY,not_removed,ok i have a bar in my basement from the it actually is neat is in fine shape and just needs a new countertop to have that classic look but it could also just be turned into a bathroom and the basement room that is finished could then be another room is that better for resale value
DIY,not_removed,that t lattice bottle holder you made actually looks nicer than some of the lattice stuff imo nice work also that top is really freakin cool nice job bro
DIY,not_removed,can i move in as your full time bartender
DIY,not_removed,looks great
DIY,not_removed,my favourite part of the build is the pillar in the centre nothing says proper bar than a sometimes awkward pillar
DIY,not_removed,so beautiful good job
DIY,not_removed,as someone who really wants to build a wet bar but has no idea where to start a this is incredible and b do you have any plans to share
DIY,not_removed,just dont install a piano and get your wife to sing youll be inviting all kinds of trouble unless you have an infant that knows how to build a time machine
DIY,not_removed,hey op i was wondering you glued down the pennies before you poured to epoxy working on a similar project
DIY,not_removed,you can tell its a bar because of the way it is
DIY,not_removed,i see you serve both gin and juice
DIY,not_removed,youre going to have to seal that
DIY,not_removed,im puzzled because i dont see any of the essential things needed to actually allow you to work the bar no ice well or sink or drainage no work surfaces or speed rails no running water no back bar there are no foot rests or even much of a bartop to sit at i wonder if youve ever bartended or been even in a small working bar how is it you missed all these other elements that could have actually made this a functional bar to serve from
DIY,not_removed,nice mimosa recipe but reverse it and less orange juice
DIY,not_removed,i notice a hangar growler under your barso you probably live in ca but you have a basement and ive never known any house in ca to have one so which is it lol
DIY,not_removed,why would anyone build around a super annoying pylon oh just wana make sure you cant see the otherside of the bar check
DIY,not_removed,bloody hell how bigs the basement
DIY,not_removed,are those pennies sealed
DIY,not_removed,i love the neature walk reference
DIY,not_removed,thats pretty neat what a beaut
DIY,not_removed,pretty good from a carpenters perspective most of my moron apprentices can barely cut and match angles
DIY,not_removed,sweet ride you should post to rbarbattlestations that really should be one of the default subreddits
DIY,not_removed,the loneliest bar in the world
DIY,not_removed,i dont see a bar but i do see a lot of wood
DIY,not_removed,definately needs a brass foot bar along the bottom
DIY,not_removed,this is cool but itd be so much cooler if the title was i built a bar in your basement
DIY,not_removed,pffft ive got one of these in my basement mine just looks a little different ok fine i have cask wine hidden in a cupboard and i hide down there and drink it as i cry and think about the crushing weight of trying to raise a family while i realise all my childhood dreams are never going to happen sometimes i jerk off too you dont see me boasting about it though just kidding nice work
DIY,not_removed,theres something depressing about this
DIY,not_removed,now you just need friends
DIY,not_removed,ware teh beer tap at
DIY,not_removed,whats the point of a bar in the house ffs we leave the house to go drinking for a reason
DIY,not_removed,read this as built a car in my basement came in to ask how the fuck you planned on getting it out
DIY,not_removed,now you can go out inside
DIY,not_removed,family guy anyone
DIY,not_removed,id be more impressed if you build a basement in your bar
DIY,not_removed,in my opinion the overhang at the front of the bar should be bigger so you can actually sit at the bar and you are going to regret that post in the middle mark my words
DIY,not_removed,op is a liarif he was a basement dweller mtndew would be on tap with huge stocks or cheetos and doritos behind the bar
DIY,not_removed,you remember those crab cakes you made im gonna need about of them actually make that about
DIY,not_removed,ive reported you for defacing currency
DIY,not_removed,what idiot would build a bar in their basement what purpose does it serve
DIY,not_removed,now you need friends
DIY,not_removed,bourbon is a sipping whiskey rye is a cocktail whiskey please use rye instead of bourbon in your old fashioned
DIY,not_removed,youll never use it
DIY,not_removed,do you entertain often enough that a bar has value
DIY,not_removed,a true alcoholic
DIY,not_removed,omg they skipped sealing the pennies
DIY,not_removed,not a bar because it doesnt actually have a bar
DIY,not_removed,correct me if im wrong i know its extreme and highly unlikely but dont the coins remain property of the government and they could potentially seize them if they wanted to great job all the same
DIY,not_removed,when women come to your bar it should be a tradition to pinch their butts and then when they turn around you go you just got bit by the goat
DIY,not_removed,shit did i forget to secure my web cam that was too close to an exact reenactment to be a coincidence
DIY,not_removed,hair of the dog that bit me lloyd
DIY,not_removed,nah your webcam was secured your windows arent though
DIY,not_removed,totally could picture this
DIY,not_removed,but help yourself to the liquor
DIY,not_removed,yeah had a bit of a problem with the kids going hog wild on the soda whilst playing xbox or watching movies down therethe mean daddy sign seems to have solved the problem
DIY,not_removed,im more interested in the neature reference on the chalk board
DIY,not_removed,i swear i read vodka
DIY,not_removed,you were one of the very first comments and i discounted your foresight lets get this comment to the top
DIY,not_removed,but did he use enough sealant you always need to be sure you use enough sealant
DIY,not_removed,but the cracks in the floor werent
DIY,not_removed,is this a reference to something what was sealed
DIY,not_removed,
DIY,not_removed,yeah i was watching that show and amazed at how like every house just has a bar in it pretty cool and awesome i wish they were still super popular
DIY,not_removed,thanks it has many imperfections and even downright screw ups if im completely honest because of my lack of experience and skill but hey its a bar in my basement and thats all that matters 😀
DIY,not_removed,lol yeah my kids and i quote that youtube video all the time and i have quite the set of snaggle teeth so the biting goat reference has always been kind of a funny inside joke for us so when i was trying to come up with a name and one of them said the biting goat bar i knew i just had to
DIY,not_removed,welp so thats where that quote comes from i havent seen the neature walk vids till now and thank you for this its like steve brule meets mountain hiking this type of humor still makes me laugh
DIY,not_removed,yeah that was my wifes doing shes pretty awesome
DIY,not_removed,the design gives away his age
DIY,not_removed,i just wish someone would address the burning question of whether or not op used a sealer
DIY,not_removed,thanks i dont like it but since i had to work around it thats the best option i could come up with
DIY,not_removed,the penny bets are where people guess how many pennies are on the bar
DIY,not_removed,im wearing this shirt right now sooo no httpiimgurcomodbelrfjpg
DIY,not_removed,thanks its super easy you buy a bottle of etching acid from hobby lobby fir like tape off whatever you dont want etched put the acid on the stuff you do want etched wait minutes and then rinse with water
DIY,not_removed,no no plans fir a tap im a scotch sod whiskey kind of guy mostly
DIY,not_removed,i actually to about worth of assorted change down to the bank and asked for it in pennies the teller looked at me like i was asking for ketchup
DIY,not_removed,anything acidic will shine mildmoderately dulled pennies ketchup in my experience works best
DIY,not_removed,vinegar and salt shines copper real nice
DIY,not_removed,whatever you do just make sure you build the new bar on stilts
DIY,not_removed,thanks im so sorry to hear it that is a lot of work lost but your idea sounds cool to the one i used good luck
DIY,not_removed,yes indeed poker table coming next installing the projector this week for that screen thats on the wall
DIY,not_removed,thanks im actually really horrible at the planning phase i get a wild hair and just jump into things then kick myself later when it cost twice as much as it should have and has all sorts of flaws and noticeable mistakes
DIY,not_removed,thanks for the reminder ive got a ton of pallets from work at the hazardous chemical factory im going to make a bed for my eight year old
DIY,not_removed,thanks i feel the same way seems like everything right now is some sort of hippie shit reclaimed or repurposed pallet piece
DIY,not_removed,you can tell because of the way it is
DIY,not_removed,i think for most people it is an over the top storagesitting area you dont really use it like a real bar but it holds all your booze and cocktail items while also providing a sitting area to occasionally sit around and drink
DIY,not_removed,i could see how it would be awesome if you were a really social outgoing person who had a large group of friends that were constantly over at your house it would be cool to have a few guy friends over sitting down there shooting the shit and enjoying a drink dont you think but if its just for you primarily then yeah i dont see the allure but to each his own and this project turned out quite i think especially from someone who admittedly isnt a pro at this and sort of did it without a concrete plan and on and off for several months
DIY,not_removed,yep i understand it either had a bar from my old house the previous owner built it became a storage shelf for stuff
DIY,not_removed,i used to work as a bartender for a catering company and i cant tell you the number of rich motherfuckers that would hire just me to pour drinks for their friends at their extravagant built in home bars denver has some rich ass people that just want someone to pour drinks for their friends
DIY,not_removed,rdrunk
DIY,not_removed,heres my lazy reasoning for building a bar my house is now the default place to watch big sporting events fantasy football drafts etc i dont need to arrange rides i dont need to pay for hotels or cabsi just get to have people to my house and go to bed when i please
DIY,not_removed,didnt you read the captions my son
DIY,not_removed,i could be wrong but i think that is for the ladies to hang their purses
DIY,not_removed,came here to say this
DIY,not_removed,no u
DIY,not_removed,no because i was looking specifically for bar topd but thats awesome nice work
DIY,not_removed,yea something about seeing some clean chalkboards just makes me feels happy inside
DIY,not_removed,thanks thats a huge peeve of mine too and thanks for the tip on the fridge its got quite a bit of room in the back and on the sides because i wasnt sure what size i was going to put there the one thats there is old and just had it sitting around
DIY,not_removed,in his album he estimates he spent between and
DIY,not_removed,thanks man id be proud to have my idea ripped off
DIY,not_removed,far more frequently than is healthy
DIY,not_removed,nope thats included
DIY,not_removed,thanks man the haters will hate and the rest of uswell well enjoy
DIY,not_removed,do it
DIY,not_removed,no way man i make a decent salary at my job and the tedious nature of that bar top would drive me insane plus with as slow as it is they could probably pay me in pennies
DIY,not_removed,because that describes all the people who come to this bar
DIY,not_removed,great advice thank you for that i was wondering how to get started and if were to ever rebuild one thats exactly what i would do
DIY,not_removed,no if i was i would have built a distillery not a dispensary
DIY,not_removed,he said he has for about of pennies so basic math would have the number be close to
DIY,not_removed,wrong
DIY,not_removed,id be open to that of someone made it happen
DIY,not_removed,just the trim im not that good
DIY,not_removed,nobody yet the prize is a free bottle
DIY,not_removed,a nickel
DIY,not_removed,i was looking for taps
DIY,not_removed,way ahead of you httpiimgurcomphclwcajpg
DIY,not_removed,step drink alcohol step get crazy idea step start crazy idea with zero plan step drink more alcohol while working on said crazy plan step stand back and marvel at complete project and wonder how it happened
DIY,not_removed,it totally is looking for a solution to that and will post updates when i implement it
DIY,not_removed,yeah thats why i have no sink the effort to cut the concrete so far was just not worth it to me
DIY,not_removed,prove it
DIY,not_removed,luxardo cherries ftfy
DIY,not_removed,im not at all a bar tender though are they gonna be brutal
DIY,not_removed,a too
DIY,not_removed,damn straight its more the army way ive tried instill into my kids dont be lying stealing cheating pieces of shit earn what you want deserve what you have and if you take whats not yours just because its there and nobody is watching then youre dead wrong
DIY,not_removed,to each their own i suppose one thing i can say after a few weeks of using it is that the pennies are much more interesting to look at than wood when youve had a few drinks
DIY,not_removed,neature walks
DIY,not_removed,
DIY,not_removed,i think i mentioned it in the photo captions but its about sqft
DIY,not_removed,i just laid them in there tight enough that they didnt move
DIY,not_removed,as they say youll find one in the bathroom mirror just around the corner and to the left
DIY,not_removed,i described this further up in the comments
DIY,not_removed,yea if it comes down to a bathroom and an extra room thats far better for resale value than a bar but in my case i have a bathroom and bedroom there already so the bar is just extra
DIY,not_removed,thanks
DIY,not_removed,yes the hours are rough and the pay is shit but youll be part of the family
DIY,not_removed,yeah darn load bearing post
DIY,not_removed,i also wanted a wet bar but the location in my basement and vicinity to a water line and a drain would have required that i cut through the basement floor for over ft in any direction to properly slope the drain and i just didnt want a wet bar quite that bad as i mentioned in the pictures i dont have any plans i just kinda winged it good luck
DIY,not_removed,nope just fit them in there tight enough that they stayed i had a couple of people helping me spread the glaze so i could just mix the whole batch at the same time and one of the guys was just pushing a little too hard while spreading the glaze around and kept knocking them loose but we just put them back and told him not to push so hard the rest of us just gently spread it around and then just let the self leveling take place
DIY,not_removed,well arent you just a ray of fucking sunshine
DIY,not_removed,wellyou see the thing is um lets see how do i put this im not a bar tender and i really dont care i wanted something that wouldnt cost a fortune that i could pour a few simple drinks at and hang out with my family and friends while watching movies playing video games or slinging cards i dont amass production environment fit for drinks per night that would have required me to cut through my concrete floor for in any direction redo my entire basement to run water or spend thousands of dollars on unnecessary time or features that i can easily do without im sorry if the term bar is so ambiguous and that mine doesnt fit your requirements
DIY,not_removed,lot of hills in ca so a fair number of homes have daylight basements below ground level at one end of the house and above at the other the windows in the wall facing the bar suggest thats whats going on here
DIY,not_removed,i live in ca and have a basement my house is over years old though so thats probably why its also a small basement it does have room for a bar though hmmm
DIY,not_removed,its actually only about sq ft
DIY,not_removed,i bet you see a lot of wood
DIY,not_removed,i agree i would have up voted the shit out of a post with that title
DIY,not_removed,if you only knew how right you are 🖕
DIY,not_removed,i can actually sit at the bar its designed so that if your beer gut is too big you have to find a new bar or go hit the weights in the corner
DIY,not_removed,the faces are still visible and the coins have not been destroyed loop holes bitches
DIY,not_removed,this kind what idiot would pay for a beer at an over crowd shit shack filled with year olds trying to get laid not me nor my friends
DIY,not_removed,please tell me you looked at all the pictures and read the descriptions two coats of bar top glaze
DIY,not_removed,damnit haters notice everything
DIY,not_removed,got by the goose
DIY,not_removed,saving this post since im looking to buy a house within the month
DIY,not_removed,how much consideration did you put into the placement when you found that it would cost too much to move the supporting pillar in the middle
DIY,not_removed,well id be able to tell because of the way that theyd be
DIY,not_removed,cmon man half of my favorite memories from childhood come from slamming mountain dews and playing xbox
DIY,not_removed,honestly id suggest securing the whole thing kids grow up and it would never hurt to be able to make sure its secured lol
DIY,not_removed,what brand of clear coat did you use it seems like they rarely turn out as nice as yours
DIY,not_removed,
DIY,not_removed,does your mum know just joking that looks amazing well done
DIY,not_removed,speaking from experience you will always have minor screw ups in a project like this but of the time you will be the one person to ever notice them great job
DIY,not_removed,you took the right approach so much lumber your fuckups dont matter
DIY,not_removed,pal i work in a bar in midtown manhattan that was gut renovated two years ago there are fuck ups and imperfections all over the place dont sweat stuff like that its part of what makes it your bar as opposed to just another chain all in all the place really looks good id love to drink there
DIY,not_removed,designed by al caholic
DIY,not_removed,soooo what area ya in that you k ow how to make an old fashioned
DIY,not_removed,right is it sealed
DIY,not_removed,i dont get the reference can you explain
DIY,not_removed,not sure if youre joking but op does mention the sealant in the album
DIY,not_removed,why didnt you remove it all the best diy projects on reddit involve removing load bearing members
DIY,not_removed,you should put a bottle opener with cap catcher on the pole to give it function
DIY,not_removed,absolutely my favorite part of the project especially the covering it looks perfect
DIY,not_removed,looks like a place i would go to drown some sorrows and watch some sports thats for sure enjoy it you did a great job
DIY,not_removed,did anybody get close
DIY,not_removed,i thought it was small penny bets placed against friends examples rick bets morty he cant lead a successful adventure john cena bets tom brady will be unsuspended before the season starts again
DIY,not_removed,why am i on it
DIY,not_removed,so is that why you used vinyl just hollow out the parts you wanted etched and cover the glass with the rest
DIY,not_removed,is it still considered a bar then wouldnt it just be an awkwardly shaped table where bottles of liquor are stored edit im not bashing the craftsmanship ive just never seen a bar without tap handles sticking out somewhere in the vicinity plus i like beer
DIY,not_removed,im going to need pennies and bottles of ketchup
DIY,not_removed,that would actually be hilarious
DIY,not_removed,this is exactly what i had in mind thank you
DIY,not_removed,hey its me your friend
DIY,not_removed,so uhh i like beer and friends
DIY,not_removed,make sure to sand it all down in a air tight room so you can taste the dust
DIY,not_removed,haha reading this as im midbuild on my basement bar made from pallets no hippie here just cheap got the pallets free from work
DIY,not_removed,and your large group of friends are always bringing you bottles of alcohol to serve them otherwise fuck that though ill gladly come over if thats your thing
DIY,not_removed,those are known as httpswwwchelseaclipcouk in the uk at least and are used to hang purses
DIY,not_removed,watch urself pal
DIY,not_removed,exactly
DIY,not_removed,it will probably be ok for a while but if it dies just look for the ones meant for built in installation next time did you have to cut the pennies to make the pattern work at the edges what did you use
DIY,not_removed,good deal im glad youre using it
DIY,not_removed,its your destiny make it so
DIY,not_removed,glad to hear that im not either haha
DIY,not_removed,stand by
DIY,not_removed,i think they will like your work despite not being a bartender because they all would love to have it on their own houses they are generally brutal about cocktails blasphemies and etc
DIY,not_removed,i enjoyed it because i would have the same kind of sign
DIY,not_removed,i feel bad for your kids childhood shouldnt be military training
DIY,not_removed,some will even say im looking right at him
DIY,not_removed,hope it didnt come across as anything but genuine i cant think of any other use of the space because of the post so including it in the build of a bar makes it for me
DIY,not_removed,thanks
DIY,not_removed,dont get all butt hurt and sarcastic it was important to speak to some of the elements that were missing because lots of people really liked your bar and wanted to emulate it by your own admission you didnt have plans for this and although beautiful there are a few things that the next guy building a bar should know about what you dont have if he uses your basic design as a model that they might want to consider running water would have been easy and inexpensive and drainage could have been solved by using a sink and draining into an open bucket but i understand why you might not want to mess with that the biggest thing missing though was just the lack of a prep or work surface behind the bar this gives you a place to make drinks and conceal your mess also the lack of overhang on the bar itself pushing those sitting at the bar back from it you also dont have a recessed kicktoe well at the bottom of the bar on the bartender side you should always have at least a six inch deep recessed kick for your feet and toes to extend into on any surface you are working up against this is all stuff that will reveal itself to you as you enjoy your bar and your version will be better for sure like i said beautiful bar but a couple of necessary elements missing for anyone who is inspired by this that is considering their own build you understand that right we just want the next guy to benefit from your build and additional considerations
DIY,not_removed,if something gets in the glaze while its curing are you able to polish it out or anything
DIY,not_removed,are you gonna install a brass pole around the bottom
DIY,not_removed,not much that spot was really the only one that would accommodate such a bar so i was pretty much stuck with either build it or dont build it
DIY,not_removed,soda is a gateway drink good idea
DIY,not_removed,youre gonna love the verification cans due out in then
DIY,not_removed,yeah mine too and now i see the perspective of my parents complaining about me slamming mountain dew and playing xbox
DIY,not_removed,jolt and nintendo for me
DIY,not_removed,drink verification can
DIY,not_removed,jesus op doesnt even take care of his guests wont even treat them to a soda
DIY,not_removed,
DIY,not_removed,the clear kind
DIY,not_removed,ohhh yeah i remember that one now thanks
DIY,not_removed,this just goes to show how people can be so sure of themselves that they are right about something and be so fucking wrong about it
DIY,not_removed,haha she sure does how else am i gonna get her to come downstairs and bring me a sammich
DIY,not_removed,i appreciate that youre right though everyone who doesnt know the flaws s skips right over them but i know theyre there
DIY,not_removed,thanks buddy youre the kind of person that would be welcome at my bar any day
DIY,not_removed,utah actuallythe land of the mormons biting goats are like unicorns here
DIY,not_removed,i scoff at your muddled fruit
DIY,not_removed,this pole here naw cant be anything important probably leftover construction crap honey pass me the blow torch
DIY,not_removed,i got that reference i always show my friends that are contractorsengineersarchitects that thread to terrify them
DIY,not_removed,im a newbie so go easy but cant you just put poles on either side of the bar to distribute the load like basically just replace the load bearing pillar with more
DIY,not_removed,this is a really great idea ive seen a couple of those posts on here and id love to make oneif i drank beer out of bottles and not cans i need a fucking can crusher
DIY,not_removed,he said about so id presume somewhere around pennies
DIY,not_removed,i used vinyl because my wifes neat crafting machine can cool designs into vinyl waaay better than i could have by hand and it sticks to the glass but yes you essentially leave the parts open that you want etched
DIY,not_removed,yeah throw a few stools around it thats literally the only requirements for a bar
DIY,not_removed,its a bar
DIY,not_removed,kegs are actually illegal in this retarded state without a license and even a lot the legal establishments around here cant get a license so i dont even bother
DIY,not_removed,you need a whole bottle for pennies those are gonna be some shiny fucking pennies
DIY,not_removed,no its not
DIY,not_removed,roberto
DIY,not_removed,no disrespect intended to each their own the only way to have a bar in your house is to have it the way you want it 😊
DIY,not_removed,maybe depends on your friends i guess i have an uncle whos a big drinker and a partner at a law firm he has a group of friends coworkers perhaps that get together once a month and drink some very expensive wine each month its someones turn to buy the however many bottles they go through in a night so having a bar would seem to be pretty cool in that scenario my uncle doesnt have a bar in his basement but he does have a pool table and a pretty wicked vinyl collection if rock is your preference
DIY,not_removed,yes and after many difficult options i discovered bolt cutters make it soooo simple
DIY,not_removed,if you think honesty hard work discipline and accountability for your choices and actions are things kids dont need then i feel bad for our country because of your kids they are destined to be the entitled little snot nosed brats that make up the worst generation in the history of the world and are single mindedly destroying america
DIY,not_removed,no it came across just right i just dont really love it there but it was deal with it or go to a huge amount of effort to move it
DIY,not_removed,nope that was the most nerve wracking part it cures super hard
DIY,not_removed,you mean like that little fluff of floating dust that gets under my screen protector every single time
DIY,not_removed,no when i looked at the cost of them i said to myself at this point i couldnt give two peanut decorated shits about a brass bar when i could fully stock it for the same price
DIY,not_removed,thank you i just laughed to tears
DIY,not_removed,every time this is posted i give this user shit for their post kind of like how you give a friend shit for doing something stupid in the past
DIY,not_removed,and chicken tendies
DIY,not_removed,should installed a dumb waiter
DIY,not_removed,no wonder you had to build your own bar
DIY,not_removed,now i know i can visit utah p
DIY,not_removed,what time can we come over might be a minute drive from tville
DIY,not_removed,well that and my brandy im sure you can name my state since thats our unofficial drink well and my post history
DIY,not_removed,link
DIY,not_removed,gavins a clever little devil
DIY,not_removed,math checks out
DIY,not_removed,actually i would have guessed way more he said that the top is sqft or mm² a penny has diameter thats circles have a packaging density of compensating for dirty and grime i will guess that gives me pennies pennies cover an area of aprox sqft so just one box of clearcoat would it be enough
DIY,not_removed,thats super neat i should try that the school that i teach at has industrial vinyl printing machines i sense a plan forming
DIY,not_removed,wow did not know that i do homebrewing and it would suck to not be able to just rack the beer to a keg and force carbonate with a tank i wonder why theyre prohibited without a license maybe because the high pressurized gas
DIY,not_removed,thats pretty messed up what state shit college must have been pretty mundane
DIY,not_removed,yes
DIY,not_removed,yeah its actually me his friend
DIY,not_removed,oh none taken just thought it was a bit ironic the hardest part is everyone has before and after pictures of pallet projects nobody really shows and explains the steps its been an interesting project so far ill probably do some sort of writeup when im finished
DIY,not_removed,damn how much do they run btw i like the way you boxed in the support it looks nice
DIY,not_removed,beautiful ill go play my now
DIY,not_removed,dont tempt me with a good time
DIY,not_removed,nah he might flip out and smack the plate out of her hands i cant believe bernie lost
DIY,not_removed,ill have you know his wife is a very smart woman thank you very much
DIY,not_removed,sound advice from the guy who chose to do maths
DIY,not_removed,why not a smart waiter i want him to get my order right
DIY,not_removed,be here at sharp every friday night
DIY,not_removed,wisconsin is the home to the brandy oldfashioned i believe never tried it but ive been meaning to for some time for scoffing at muddled fruit sugar cube bitters bourbon and an orange peel squeezed just to release the oils also theres a book i got for my birthday called the oldfashioned that talks about the history of the drink very quick and interesting read and lots of good variant recipes in the back great book to keep by the bar
DIY,not_removed,ha yeah the first thing i looked for when i saw your post was a wisconsin old fashioned
DIY,not_removed,if my head were veal which i know it is not how much do you think it would be worth just checking are we talking about the same gavin
DIY,not_removed,my brain just broke but im gonna just go ahead and smile and nod and take another sip
DIY,not_removed,just in case anyone reading doesnt conveniently have access to vinyl printing ive also done the same kind of glass etching paint on armor etch over a template wash off using stencils cut in contact paper with an xacto knife
DIY,not_removed,because utah
DIY,not_removed,google the prices seriously they are crazy expensive when we did ours we wanted to add to the front if the bar and i scrapped the idea after pricing them out op is right he could stock his bar pretty well for the price if them
DIY,not_removed,thank you im gonna just go back and read more of him
DIY,not_removed,he said tendie not handy
DIY,not_removed,i didnt choose the maths life the maths life choose me
DIY,not_removed,love that book despise cherries and simple syrup in my old fashioned there was a restaurantbar right down the road from me minute walk that had incredible an incredible old fashioned last time i went they had added a cherry such a shame
DIY,not_removed,correct sir thats the old fashioned i know and love
DIY,not_removed,haha great brandy is amazing make sure to try classic krobel that and jager wi loves their specific drinks
DIY,not_removed,where did you get all those pennies from
DIY,not_removed,well the bible must say something about proper fermented beverage storage that i was unaware of thankfully we have these wonderful instructions gifted to us so we know how to live right s
DIY,not_removed,i dont use cherries myself but i dont mind a cherry used as a garnish muddled anything just makes me want to bring the drink back to the bartender and told him i wanted a pulpfree oldfashioned as the shit floating around in it drives me nuts maybe just as much as the effect on the taste as far as simple syrup goes i prefer to muddle the bitters and sugar cube but im guessing id fail a blind taste test where the only difference was that and simple syrup
DIY,not_removed,we drop all of our spare change into bottles and just save it up till we have a bunch so of that about was pennies and then i took the rest of the change down to the bank and traded it for pennies the only had in pennies but that worked out to be just about right
DIY,not_removed,i have yet to have an old fashioned with muddled fruit just the sugar wi knows their old fashion drinks
DIY,not_removed,looks like the lcd just has a ribbon cable so you need to take apart whats necceary to get inside and then remove the old one and put the new one in shouldnt take much technical know how

DIY,not_removed,these tips and techniques will get you started but they just scratch the proverbial surface design elements are critical too — color images layout — as well as video audio and other interactivity elements whose purpose is to more deeply engage the reader and boost response they all merit a deeper look and testing where it makes sense make sure your headline refers directly to the place from which your visitor came or the ad copy that drove the click match your language as exactly as you can close is good exact is best this way you keep your visitor oriented and engaged this is by far the most important part of your landing page provide a clear call to action whether you use graphic buttons or hotlinked text or both tell your visitor what they need to do i use a minimum of calls to action in a short landing page in a long landing page copy tests here will give you the biggest bang next to testing headlines write in the second person – you and your no one gives a rats patootie about you your company or even your product or service except as to how it benefits him or her the bigger the company the more time i spend rewriting their stuff from we to you write to deliver a clear persuasive message not to showcase your creativity or ability to turn a clever phrase this is business not a personal expression of your art every copy coaching student hears me say this at least once you can write long copy as long as its tight i always err on writing a little long on the first drafts because its easier to edit down than to pad up skimpy copy your reader will read long copy as long as you keep building a strong motivating case for himher to act however not every product or service will require the same amount of copy investment rule of thumb think longer copy when youre looking to close a sale think shorter copy for a subscription signup or something that doesnt necessarily require a cash commitment be crystal clear in your goals keep your body copy on point as a logical progression from your headline and offer dont add tangential thoughts ancillary services and generic hoohah hoohah makes the client feel good but wastes the readers time every digression is a conversion lost keep your most important points at the beginning of paragraphs and bullets most visitors are skimming and skipping through your copy make it easy for them to get the joke without having to slow down in line with people read beginnings and ends before they read middles make sure you keep your most critical persuasive arguments in these positions make your first paragraph short no more than lines thats lines not sentences vary your paragraph line length from here it helps create visual dissonance and makes it easier to read your copy and no paragraph should be more than lines long at any time write to the screen take a piece of paper and frameout where your text buttons and design elements will go consider how much of your content will be seen above the fold or at the first screen you can still go long and have visitors scroll downward if so youll want to make sure you repeat essential calls to action testimonials and other components so no matter where your visitor is an act now link or button remains is visible bonus tips remove all extraneous matter from your landing page this includes navigation bars visual clutter and links to other sections you want the reader focused solely on your copy your supportive visuals and the offer youre making without being tempted to wander around the room dont ask for what you dont need ask for only enough information to complete the sale or the desired action this isnt the time to conduct a marketing survey every question you ask every piece of information you require will chip away at your response be judicious assume nothing test everything
DIY,not_removed,i dont understand these are all projects i worked on myself why are they blocked
DIY,not_removed,yep but read the box for dye setting instructions i think cotton is set with vinegar but not sure read the box this assures long dye lifetimes between treatments also would look into a uv spray protectant like a scotchgard type product hope it helps
DIY,not_removed,there are no special concerns really unless you have children that may try to gnaw on the cushions if you do then i recommend a baby safe dye like dharma you will want to read the instructions first but most dyes need to have a soda ash soak prior to dying they also make a outdoor fabric paint or you can diy that too but the diy will require a bit more work
DIY,not_removed,ive had good results with this httpwwwpracticalprimitivecomskillofthemonthblackwalnutdyehtml
DIY,not_removed,any dyes you use will eventually fade from sunlight but if theyre cotton you can most definitely use the standard rit dye that you can buy almost anywhere and follow the directions on the box just remember to wash the covers first so that any starch or protectant from the factory is removed otherwise it could resist the dye im a fiber arts teacher and have a world of dye info in my brain feel free to message me for help or any questions you might have
DIY,not_removed,i also just had a thought have these been weather treated already if they have dye might not stick as well could come out splotchy the fabric paint store bought or diy might be the best option
DIY,not_removed,roll on bedliner and a small sponge roller you could set it on a couple of gallon buckets and just keep coating the tires over and over until you finish the gallon that should keep them rubbery for a while probably take a weekend to do and cure

DIY,not_removed,there are a couple certain epoxies mainly but none that i know of that dont eventually yellow in the presence of uv light what is the ultimate goal might be able to suggest something else
DIY,not_removed,the purpose is to reflect sunlight onto solar panels into windows at solar water heater etc
DIY,not_removed,without a specific goal and design constraints no one is going to be able to help you figure out what will best work for you sorry come back with those and try again
DIY,not_removed,thanks for watching
DIY,not_removed,you need to provide more information deck size plays into it a lot as does access it could be a reasonably simple matter of leveraging the deck back against the ledger and adding some hardware or it could be a case of deconstructing the whole thing and rebuilding the biggest factor is if the ledger itself was properly installed if that has carriage bolts or is just nails too pics
DIY,not_removed,nails should only have been used to keep the ledger board in place while lag bolts were driven in it might be possible to drill holes though the ledger board and drive in lag bolts to pull the deck back flush with the house you do however have to determine whats behind there and if you can drive lag bolts into it without either missing structure or damaging something
DIY,not_removed,any pictures
DIY,not_removed,do you own the house do you have insurance these would be the biggest questions to answer first considering if you didnt fix the problem correctly and someone got injured on your deck you would be held liable if you are not very mechanically inclined you may want to hire a trusted insured builder to do it its tough to imagine without photos to see what the structure of the deck is is it high off the ground how are the footings that hold up the rest of the deck are they done properly or is it just that the deck is sagging on the side closest to the house due to separation from the ledger the ledger should be bolted to the house with galvanized lag screws and properly flashed to prevent water from getting behind it and rotting your sill

DIY,not_removed,durams rock hard wood putty
DIY,not_removed,bondo
DIY,not_removed,wood putty would work fine use at least inch putty knife run it down the undamaged part as a guidepush in the putty using a horizontal motion then smooth pulling the knife down dont worry about the first coat being smooth let dry knock down the high spots coat sand and repeat till good prime and fill any holes paint the weather stripping is commonly available and easy to install
DIY,not_removed,wood putty in layers i had the same problem and surprisingly it worked well from experience just have patience in matching the putty seamlessly to the wood to have it looking brand new again
DIY,not_removed,bondo autobody filler and sand to match profile or just take the trim off and replacelooks like very typical profile easy to get at home depot or any big box
DIY,not_removed,if you are renting stop and speak to your landlord dont damage their property further with a crappy repair
DIY,not_removed,i had the same problem you cant order part of a door jamb as such but you can get a piece of the right size lumber and replace that piece i have a dog and i have done that if you arent handy i suggest finding a local handyman also take advantage of the opportunity to repaint the whole door jamb and replace the weather stripping
DIY,not_removed,thats part of the frame jamb and is not easily replaced i see the weather stripping is damaged as well if it was mine and i didnt want to replace the door i would buy some wood bondo and new weather stripping wood bondo is the same as for your car but for wood pretty basic to use cutting out that piece and trying to replace it would be a decent amount of work and look bad good luck
DIY,not_removed,my recommendation would be a dutchman below is a link to the basics httpswwwthisoldhousecomhowtohowtorepairrotdamagedutchman
DIY,not_removed,pull that shit off and replace it
DIY,not_removed,have a professional fix that if you arent handy that damage will be too difficult to fix properly on your own also train the dog better
DIY,not_removed,wood putty or get rid of the dog
DIY,not_removed,totally off topic but i just stumbled on this product today while trying to find something to repair minor damage to outdoor garage door home depot and others all looked at me funny and directed me to wood filler when i asked for wood putty anyway would you recommend this product would it be like the wood putty that my dad would have used on his wooden boat ive come across some of that marine putty while stripping the door with a heat gun and its really stood the test of time its clearly the first layer of filler someone later came in with caulking which shrunk and took the paint with it anyway reason i ask is id have to order durams rock hard wood putty or just put up with what i have some sort of interiorexterior wood filler sorry for the tangent
DIY,not_removed,i think getting rid of the dog should be first no matter what the other steps are
DIY,not_removed,ive used this stuff for decades it comes in powder form and you mix up just as much as you need at a time it takes just a little water to mix up a firm paste you can let it set up a bit more to allow for working into the shape you want mix up a bit fill in the grooves and allow it to dry it dries very rapidly you can sand it and then touch up the bits that look rough it is easy to work with and cheap with this a little patience some good paint youll pass muster it will fill big gaps it shrinks a bit as it dries so expect to have to go over it again to get a smooth finish
DIY,not_removed,unnecessary you just need to actually train the dog
DIY,not_removed,thanks so works like old drywall compoundpolyfilla
DIY,not_removed,thanks so works like old drywall compoundpolyfilla
DIY,not_removed,my wife has two dogs who enjoy nothing more than destruction arguments have zero effect anything to try and affect their behavior is cruelty we i finally die know that im finally free

DIY,not_removed,its a long post so i hope this works out okay but if anyone has questions about this build im happy to answer i consider myself a novice to the woodworking and concrete trades ive never built anything really until the beginning of this year all much smaller in scale but i love to learn ive researched read and watched a lot of informative sources and listening to the pros always helps its a fun challenge that makes me think be more active and create some cool designs
DIY,not_removed,nice work with pieces this thin id recommend bending rebar around the corners theres a lot of potential for stress there i imagine that the wood keeps it from racking but having screwed up a lot of concrete castings i tend to overbuild i wouldnt want to see some dodohead push the piece sideways and flex a corner how do you feel about having skipped the silicone are your cornersedges crumbly at all thats not to keep the cement mix from leaking its to keep water from escaping from the mix concrete must stay wet to cure properly you talk about letting the piece dry but what you really want is for it to which is the complete reaction between the water and the lime poorly cured itll have a dusty surface that may develop crazing which is a pattern of fine cracks and itll be a lot more fragile you want to make sure it stays moist and between and degrees f for about a week keep it in the mold and as wet as possible its boring but you get significantly greater strength and less permeability we cure smaller pieces by leaving them completely immersed in water for a while after they come out of the mold remesh is good by itself in flat faces and also for holding rebar reinforcements in place i cant tell what kind of mix you use but i dont see any aggregate stone aggregate may not produce the look you want without vibrating or pounding but it adds a lot of strength if youre going to be doing more of this and want smooth surfaces get a wet diamond polisher theyre a bloody mess to use but you cant get supersmooth surfaces without one i also accidentally discovered that concrete cast against packing tape comes out of the mold with a glasslike finish without polishing i keep meaning to experiment more with this i want to try a glasslined mold did you seal it you need to do that so it wont absorb everything it comes into contact with every drinking glass cup bottle plate will leave a ring my gf and i use a mix of tung oil citrus solvent but that takes forever to do the zillion coats my gf says its not that bad but shes batshit crazy fu tung cheng has httpstoreconcreteexchangecomchengconcretecountertopsealer thats very quick quick applications and makes a pretty liquidresistant finish tung oil has a significant advantage in that it can be endlessly reapplied when neededno stripping or grinding i dont know how or if the cheng sealer is reapplied as it has polymers in it tung oil can be pigmented to a degree which is cool we have some dark tung thats really nice my last piece of advice do not attempt to carry lb countertops by yourself my lower back grew a melonsized dome and has never been the same since stupid i was trying to prove how tough i was since id been limping around complaining of foot pain turned out that i had gout walk it off my girlfriend said ow anyhoo great work very cool piece
DIY,not_removed,looks lovely but one knock please use hardwood in the future its this beautiful creation and then theres pine
DIY,not_removed,furniture movers hate him
DIY,not_removed,i will not help you move
DIY,not_removed,should have taken a lighter stain colour
DIY,not_removed,would love to see a finished photo once it is in your friends apartment i feel like the photo in your garage doesnt do it justice its an amazing piece and has me inspired to try and do my own awesome work
DIY,not_removed,i wouldnt think that concrete finds the same things entertaining as wood does
DIY,not_removed,how much did materials cost and how much would you charge for something like this if you did it again how many hours did you put into this total im seriously impressed and jealous this looks like something straight out of a restoration hardware catalogue
DIY,not_removed,this post made me say ooh gawd i dont know why it was just instinct beautiful absolutely beautiful
DIY,not_removed,beautiful
DIY,not_removed,i love the design
DIY,not_removed,looks great i have done a few coffee tables if you use a vibrator and mix your own concrete with smaller aggregate all those bubbles will go away i like it both ways though looks great
DIY,not_removed,this is gorgeous
DIY,not_removed,awesome job will have to try this myself now
DIY,not_removed,also for those wondering i do have access to a wet polisher for concrete but elected to strictly do an acid wash and hand pad sanding for the edges the form was in great condition right out of the form and didnt need a ton of cosmetic work ive used both but have started leaning toward more acidonly finishes as the result is more of the look i like and its a lot faster and easier
DIY,not_removed,good post i enjoyed this post
DIY,not_removed,im curious how it would look if the concrete were stained possible with a pattern
DIY,not_removed,
DIY,not_removed,total weight is about by my rough calculations were actually taking this to my friends story apartment i foresee blood sweat and tears in my near future
DIY,not_removed,you should put some casters on it itll be a pain in the ass to move it around
DIY,not_removed,the rebar curvature would have been a little too risky with such a small space we elected to leave it knowing the cost of what could happen but it was going to have plenty of support as is so it wasnt stressed over too much cure right thats what i meant we used a high strength countertop mix not gfrc but we have experience using both and we did use a professional sealer too thanks
DIY,not_removed,i hear ya dude i really wanted to use nicer stuff by since it was for my friend who was hoping to keep costs down we had to stick to a smaller budget ill gladly make another one for you using hardwood
DIY,not_removed,and toddlers
DIY,not_removed,id be happy to make another for you that way i liked the darker to contrast the lighter concrete more
DIY,not_removed,for sure ill do a followup on that for ya its going in on friday maybe thats why ive been getting downvoted so much the ugly garage lol
DIY,not_removed,materials was about with basically the cheapest options available he got the whole thing for a steal if you factor in a lot of long hours building if we end up making this form again it would sell for about thanks for the kind words maybe ill post the conference table build were working on next it has a similar aesthetic
DIY,not_removed,i concur good comment i enjoyed this comment
DIY,not_removed,its definitely doable a lot of work would go into it with taping off the lines you needed for a pattern but not unheard of
DIY,not_removed,i agree unfortunately the person who wanted this wanted it to have no gap from their floor so dust wouldnt get under it
DIY,not_removed,love the project and it looks great to add a little to what uneuromonkey said as well as your comment here the rebar on the corners is actually really easy to do just take two long pieces of rebar and make a pair of giant staples another option is to just make four pieces and wire tie the longer sections that are on the table top portion kinda like hockey sticks with the handles tied together then wire tie a couple cross pieces of bar to keep them square to eachother to reduce the riskiness of it use tape or a sharpie etc to make identical marks on the bar pieces so they stay equal length the absolute easiest way to make identical bends is to build a jig with a itll keep the bends even and on the same plane as they will be laying flat on the table the whole time cut the end of the a little sharper than to account for springback just clamp that sucker right along the edge of your work table and on up to one corner leaving a little ledge for the bar to sit line your bar up to the edge of the by the marks then clamp the long side to the table and bend the short side mind the seam that little line that runs down the sides of rebar thats the seam keep those lines perpendicular to the bend just like the seams on your pants at the knee you wouldnt want those seams over your knee so keep them at the sides also as uneuromonkey briefly mentioned vibrating is a thing you can run your jitterbug sander on the form duringafter the pour to vibrate the mix and get rid of those pockets it didnt look like it was too necessary as your surface came out pretty good regardless but it can definitely help with the strength as well as the appearance if a smoother look is desired then again you mightve done it but just didnt mention it anyways that all depends on if you do a similar project in the future cuz this one is done now blah blah blah youre project still looks great and im probably going to shamelessly steal some of it for a project or two of my own good work
DIY,not_removed,you can use a boat load of fibermesh also it will add a lot of strength to the corners if you dont want to deal with bending the bar
DIY,not_removed,all good i do woodworking concrete kinda most things ill be doing one of these edit i hate plumbing tho p
DIY,not_removed,i almost missed the post myself the picture is very dark so you can barely see the finished product in the small thumbnail glad i clicked on it though
DIY,not_removed,in my opinion is cheap you would see something like this at restoration hardware for double that
DIY,not_removed,haha jeez thats gonna suck when they move
DIY,not_removed,thanks for the thoughts yeah i may have skipped a basic step because we did vibrate it plenty at least that step is mentioned here im glad you liked the project though id be interested to see the jig youre talking about i dont plan to use rebar much more as were working with gfrc more and everything will be even thinner but knowing more techniques wouldnt hurt just in case i dont doubt that the rebar turns are easy but these walls are only thick and the rebar we had was already set to and the foam knockouts were about deep so not a ton of wiggle room my primary concern was the bar shifting to one side or the other and becoming exposed also from past pours in my experience even if the rebar is marginally too close to the face but not exposed it changes the finish slightly to become less consistent its shows a blooming effect of sorts which i definitely didnt want the mix we had was psi so i knew it could hold up really well if cured correctly i went back and forth about overengineering it or leaving it be but leaned to do less since this whole piece was minimal and structurally supported by the wood i dont think its an essential part of the process at these dimensions but could be on more demanding forms for sure
DIY,not_removed,id love to get to that point im gonna have to check into that stuff more ive always loved modern decor and design but havent really had a lot real experience with it im just a graphic designer for my day job but wanted to do more hands on designing with a particular eye this design was completely original and i like coming up with new functions that arent so traditional in both of these trades now im even more inspired
DIY,not_removed,ah right on wasnt sure if youd gone for vibrating it or not and if you mentioned it i must have missed it nothing wrong with the but going with or maybe even might allay any worries of bulging some sort of mini dobie would help with the shifting if a cross piece and wire dont do the trick yeah im shit at descriptions but it really is just a and some clamps on a work table you leave a little space between the edge of the table and the side of the so you can just lay your rebar on there the place where you want to bend is lined up on the end of the with the one side of the rebar clamped down to the tablejig and the rest sticking out you can use a pipe or another to push that free end until you get your bend angle plus a little bit for spring back it wont work for radius bends but another and something for a cam fixes that ill mock one up and take some pictures for you ive got a few pieces of scrap bar and some lumber laying around so itll be quick n easy the fancy version looks like this but you dont need all those angles just the so instead of welding up a jig like this you do the same with a and clamps on a table of course you can always just bend it close enough with a vise then perfect it with a hammer and a framing square and yeah i really do like your piece good lines and colors
DIY,not_removed,dude so sorry i got absolutely swamped with work and never got around to taking those photos for you i finally have some free time so ill be taking care of that today
DIY,not_removed,pm sent
DIY,not_removed,ikea has some solid birch that is long

DIY,not_removed,hey what is wrong with my question
DIY,not_removed,read the removal message
DIY,not_removed,yeah i did twicewhich part exactly am i violating
DIY,not_removed,all of it the message shouldnt be hard to understand what part dont you understand feel free to cut and paste what you find confusing when you reply
DIY,not_removed,for real sounded like a legit question to mebut you allow bagpipes from rubber chickens yeah have a nice day my friend
DIY,not_removed,that user was asking a specific question which did not require research read the removal message again carefully
DIY,not_removed,again which sentence in the removal message do you not understand hopefully i can clarify what it means if you tell me specifically what you are confused about
DIY,not_removed,i wasnt asking anyone for research rather was hoping someone else had experience connecting the thing to home wiring as a diy sub and a popular gizmo i figured folks would know about it this is the wrong sub for this i guess
DIY,not_removed,i wasnt asking anyone for research you really need to read the removal message carefully
DIY,not_removed,thx again for your help
DIY,not_removed,i suppose youre welcome but i never really helped you because you never told me what you didnt understand oh well
DIY,not_removed,very nice i cant tell too much of a difference i wonder if the fire helmets were just repurposed army gear i mean the shape is identical as far as i can see
DIY,not_removed,excellent job
DIY,not_removed,no theyre actually not a lot of army helmets were recrafted to cooking pots and such things the fire department has similar helmets as far as the shape slightly differs from the wwii types and the holes are different as i mentioned i closed the two groups of small holes on each site and drilled one big hole the shape is very practical so there was no need to change the desingn of the fire helmets
DIY,not_removed,thank you
DIY,not_removed,wow that thing is so ugly
DIY,not_removed,wow this is great thanks for ideas have you seen this too
DIY,not_removed,thank you
DIY,not_removed,i have and it is really easy to recreate i am doing a two in one with it will be a collab video with another youtuber and we are painting the case to look like cloud and link are crossing swords
DIY,not_removed,nice tutorial though
DIY,not_removed,i appreciate it i used paints and whatever i had lying around the house i was going to do it black and red but the led strip i had was blue so it limited me since i am a new youtuber i cant afford to spend a lot on these
DIY,not_removed,for the undercabinet lights this kit may work it is waterproof and you can easily cut it to length the color can be controlled with the remote for the bathroom this has a passive infrared sensor pir that turns on the light when someone enters the area

DIY,not_removed,can get those same products from amazon sometimes for less than the mfgr site i think the super night ones are like with free shipping through prime
DIY,not_removed,cool
DIY,not_removed,asbestos isnt exactly a poison its more the lung cancer you may develop in many years that you should be worried about i would either leave them where they are or hire someone to remove it
DIY,not_removed,the problem isnt just removing the tiles but disposing of them afterwards as others have said if you are going to remove them keep them wet and wear a decent mask also it pays to make sure that the dust doesnt enter other parts of the house so you will need to seal off your basement you then get to the issue of where are you going to dispose of them even after you have taken them up once they start to dry out you are still going to have the risk of particles floating around does your local dump allow asbestos refuse are you going to transport in a sealed trailer the best option if it is possible is to leave them and probably seal them and then put another floor over top
DIY,not_removed,no leave it well alone and either leave it as is or hire a company to come in and remove it
DIY,not_removed,the danger from asbestos comes from having tiny fragments of the strands get stuck in your lungs accumulated over time from dust floating in the air if youre not breakingsawinggrinding the tiles and youre keeping the surface wetted its hard to see how any asbestos fibers could get suspended in the air to breathe in it wouldnt be a bad idea to hang plastic around the work area to keep the air contained from the rest of the house and to wear glasses and air filter
DIY,not_removed,do not try to remove it yourself asbestos fibers will end up everywhere if you dont know how to safely remove it and i take it you dont its worth the money to have it done right
DIY,not_removed,you do not want mesothelioma call professional abatement specialists thank me in twenty five years
DIY,not_removed,also disposal is an issue removing yourself well thats your risk but disposing it improperly makes it dangerous for everyone else
DIY,not_removed,you should hire specialist dont leave them in your basement it can make some serious issues in the long run in my country poland only specialists can remove and recycle asbestos

DIY,not_removed,grantedbut then again how likely is it that you would develop cancer after removing one housesworth one time i might have it wrong but isnt asbestos one of those things that caused problems after longterm exposure the kind of thing that just causes problems for the people who worked with it all the time i can definitely see the people removing it for a living having to take extreme measures to avoid breathing it inbut how dangerous is it for a onetime exposure as long as you take measures to prevent the dust from settling elsewhere in the house to be constantly stirred back up again over time id consider that to be longterm exposure note im not arguing for so much as honestly asking
DIY,not_removed,also not to mention your clothes tools the car seat the washing machine and dryer asbestos is nasty stuff when i used to do asbestos removal in the oil refineries they would give us selfcontained oxygen ventilators not everyone wore them which ill never understand its a shame asbestos will kill you pound for pound the best insulation material that exists
DIY,not_removed,its a fair question and you probably wont know for years even then you wont know if that was the cause or just random bad luck the official party line is not to touch it not saying your wrong but im not qualified to suggest anything else

DIY,not_removed,how far are you from the door since youre all about basic the first thing that comes to mind is putting a spring on the hook that pulls it down then using a string paracord fishing line and a few pulleys so you can just pull on the string to raise the hook to open and then relatch it
DIY,not_removed,see thats the issue i can do that alright but it would look ridiculous and not very aesthetically pleasing so having a remote door unlocker would be amazing
DIY,not_removed,call your landlord use a wire coat hanger to try and fish for any hair or something else try a drain cleaner call a plumber

DIY,not_removed,pictures would help a lot to see what you are dealing with
DIY,not_removed,try a psi pressure washer if the stucco is solid enough you may not be able to remove enough to make it look normal again in which case you may just have to repaint and move on
DIY,not_removed,ugh hate to say it but you may be screwed here seeing how well the paint is bonded the prep work was done correctly maybe try a steam cleaner its a pressure washer with a heater combination you need to soften the paint hence the need for heat might try a heat gun first if afraid of washing out the stucco else i would just re prep it and primepaint a color i could live with good luck
DIY,not_removed,i missed the pictures i think that you may want to find a color that you find more agreeable repaint it and make your peace with it unless it just kills you i think once you get started and get a feel for how much work that will be you may regret it but by then you will be committed to the project
DIY,not_removed,i think so too im gonna try a heat gun first
DIY,not_removed,yes a deck project in rdiy time to get the popcorn oh he did a nice job well damn
DIY,not_removed,good idea on the privacy wall i like the matching playhouse
DIY,not_removed,that really takes this house from oh lets plonk this rectangular house here to a feeling of a real home being anchored to the site
DIY,not_removed,that little smaller matching house is so cute great work on the porch
DIY,not_removed,that roof on the house is pretty swe et what is that called looks like the corrugated plastic stuff that we use for sheds but much much heavier and nicer looking
DIY,not_removed,where in finland good job they should have built the house with a deck like this
DIY,not_removed,why are there permanently installed ladders going up to your and your neighbors rooves
DIY,not_removed,nice work it isnt as important in this case because you have a roof over the old deck but anytime you reuse existing joists its best to cover the tops of them in selfadhesive waterproof flashing tape the reason for this is that the holes from the removed screwsnails can trap water and rot the wood prematurely
DIY,not_removed,you just dug a big pit next to your house are you worried about rainwater accumulation and potential flooding the roof may help mitigate that somewhat but in heavy rain i can imagine the gravel pit next to your house filling up with water do you have a basement i ask because i had rainwater infiltration into the basement of my house in heavy rain and the solution was to essentially do the opposite of what you just did i had to bring in a lot of dirt and create a long gently sloping angle away from the house
DIY,not_removed,nice makes me reevaluate my decision to live in downtown haha
DIY,not_removed,have you considered wire mesh to keep critters out from under the deck
DIY,not_removed,may i ask where this is p edit my guess is sweden
DIY,not_removed,what kind of roof shingle is that im not sure ive ever seen it before
DIY,not_removed,isnt all of the water from your backyardthe water youre diverting away from the deck just running back under the deck and toward your foundation from the pictures it looks like the ground is sloping toward the house
DIY,not_removed,i like the minimal use of railings the right side is a perfect little talent show stage with grass seating
DIY,not_removed,what is the black rod running the length of the roof
DIY,not_removed,you should put your house in southern california that way you wont need the rain gutters and will get more use from the porch
DIY,not_removed,the total cost of the project exceeded our estimated budget by about it always does
DIY,not_removed,i just want to say it looks great and i hope to one day have your skills tools time and money
DIY,not_removed,looks nice one question though what is going to happen to all the water that goes into your gravel pit you created under your deck when it gets near freezing
DIY,not_removed,when my parents did this about ten years ago they found lots of old glass alcohol bottles under the grass that house was built in the forties did you find anything interesting
DIY,not_removed,its very nice gives me hope for my upcoming deck project did you consider different downspout filtering options pic it seems that any heavy downpour is just going to shoot right past that opening in the deck and it is a possible trip hazard ive seen attached ones that are enclosed that go inline with the pipe
DIY,not_removed,i like your roofbut that one tileit makes me twitch
DIY,not_removed,just out of curiosity you mentioned snow load which makes sense given your location but i am wondering during if that clear plastic covering is rated to carry that load
DIY,not_removed,looks nice the thumbnail and the roof made it look like a korean house
DIY,not_removed,that was a load bearing deck
DIY,not_removed,im interested in doing the same but worried about needing permits and stuff the fire dept already hassled my parents about their fire pit big ticket so im inclined to learn what im supposed to apply or file or whatever with the city
DIY,not_removed,how much money do you save building your own deck compared to paying a company to do it
DIY,not_removed,all diy folk you might like the houzz web site httpwwwhouzzcom
DIY,not_removed,are there bricks in us houses or are they all timber construction
DIY,not_removed,this is from finland remember that ventilation under your roof will probably get blocked by snow ice with wind mixed with unstable changes in temperature and if the ends of that image gets blocked it will create lots of moisture if bad luck with weather
DIY,not_removed,awesome also i love your roof
DIY,not_removed,looks gerogrous what a fun project makes me wish i had a houseand the time and money for a project like this can i ask did the you quoted include the playhouse also is that wood decking or composite and wheres the grill
DIY,not_removed,that matching playhouse is really nice did you build that yourself also
DIY,not_removed,whats the roof wland what are those racks looks great
DIY,not_removed,it looks beautiful however i really wish you used treated wood for the frame
DIY,not_removed,so one big thing that is going to be a huge issue here is that you are draining all rainwater from your roof to go under your deck i hope you dont have a basement because all that rainwater from the roof plus all the rain water form the deck is going to be making your sump pump work overtime
DIY,not_removed,this guy knows what hes doing
DIY,not_removed,dude where do you get lego roof tiles
DIY,not_removed,why a wooden porch instead of just wooden steps down and a concrete patio patio doesnt rot patio doesnt get animals under it patio doesnt get termites dont need to paint patio can safely use firepit and grill on patio cost
DIY,not_removed,next project is to replace the kiddie pool with a hot tub right
DIY,not_removed,im no back porch expert but from what i can tell you did one hell of a nice job looks great
DIY,not_removed,damn good job the roofing tiles are nice too
DIY,not_removed,looks sweet if it were my deck i would have done the non covered portion on concrete i hate the upkeep of wood decks
DIY,not_removed,very nice did you draw up formal plans for this first
DIY,not_removed,looks like you were busy all weekend nice job what state i have a similar sized house sq feet in metro ny well long island
DIY,not_removed,is your roof made out of giant legos
DIY,not_removed,question for you in pictures and did you mount the wooden support beam in the concrete or let the concrete set then add more and the beam it looked like you said you did something after the initial set and rebar but i just couldnt wrap my head around it any chance you could explain that step for me
DIY,not_removed,is that a ladder going up to your roof and a catwalk is that required where your at also what kind of roof is that on the house i like it
DIY,not_removed,nice work
DIY,not_removed,what are those horizontal bars on the roof is that a permanent ladder on the right
DIY,not_removed,thought that tile roof was an entire solar array in the thumbnail i was nearly extremely impressed porch looks good too though
DIY,not_removed,how did you get away with such shallow footers being that far north
DIY,not_removed,amazing work
DIY,not_removed,wow very nice job
DIY,not_removed,looks good op dont mind the inevitable stream of unemployed construction workers that will come in and critique it you did a great job
DIY,not_removed,it looks amazing for a diy on top of having a great place to bbq youve increased your home value money well spent
DIY,not_removed,you appear to have no boundary fences whats that all about how does that work
DIY,not_removed,check your math not
DIY,not_removed,everyone is talking about some roof tile look through the pictures fuck you cant stop looking at that tile how can you live with that
DIY,not_removed,it looks really nice but i cant help thinking every time i see a porch including my brothers that its a complete waste of space why not create a lift up door to cooler or or fridge or other storage if i had a porch high off of the ground enough i would create an insulated shed underneath for gardening stuff but i would put all of the garden stuff on an oversized pullout drawer for easy access if were dreaming here why not create an insulated hideaway dumbwaiter of some sort for the grill all the deck furniture could be stored below the deck to make cleaning easier sports gear and outdoor toys below deck but then i dont own a house so what do i know
DIY,not_removed,yeah theres been a few diy projects here that has been questionable
DIY,not_removed,got so excited that i gave in and checked the comments before the pictures was happily disappointed
DIY,not_removed,yeah wtf op i want blood
DIY,not_removed,im only here to read why this is going to fail catastrophically
DIY,not_removed,ha i came for the same thing oh lets see all the stuff he did wrong
DIY,not_removed,my first thought your second comment dashed my hopes
DIY,not_removed,yeah but he also spent a shit ton of money too
DIY,not_removed,i couldnt help but wonder if the neighbor whos help was invaluable lives on the other side of that privacy wall
DIY,not_removed,i want so bad to do the same to the back of my house which has that square look right now i want to do a three season room on top of a deck foundation that extends out as a deck too all for the exact reason you just said sigh better start saving up
DIY,not_removed,im no expert but it looks like conventional everywhere except in north america clay roof tiling
DIY,not_removed,theyre called httpwwwbendersseengbrangeroofingconcreterooftiles in english apparently
DIY,not_removed,isnt lego
DIY,not_removed,for the chimney sweep primarily or for any other maintenance which requires roof access for that matter i think its mandatory edit oh and for replacing damaged roof tiles with mismatched ones like i did last summer
DIY,not_removed,osha no longer allows santa to land on certain roof pitches this allows him access
DIY,not_removed,thats definitely something you dont see here in the states but itd be damn convenient
DIY,not_removed,thanks thats very good advice
DIY,not_removed,yeah i know didnt really notice how skewed it looks until now that i looked through the pictures the original idea was to have it line up perfectly but the rainwater pipe made it tricky also the roof sheets are wide meaningthen wed had to get one more of them and only cut out a small slice to use thankfully its not noticeable when youre actually sitting on the porch
DIY,not_removed,damn you for pointing that out
DIY,not_removed,i understand your concern we did not however dig all the way to the wall next to the wall we left a ca wide stretch of gravel which goes all the way down into the ground as far as the base of the house goes theres no basement i dont really have the words to explain this in english this part of the project was supervised by two professionals so i can but hope they havent overlooked anything
DIY,not_removed,actually its to the contrary a gravel pit will help drainage
DIY,not_removed,there are special drainage pipes dug into the ground
DIY,not_removed,no i havent but i might now
DIY,not_removed,my guess is finland
DIY,not_removed,my guess is that it is to stop mini avalanches from hitting people on the ground
DIY,not_removed,for snow
DIY,not_removed,perhaps it does not freeze there here on the east coast of the usa we put footers about into the earth to prevent heaving from the frozen earth below
DIY,not_removed,as others touched on gravel has large voids so water passes through it easily
DIY,not_removed,nope unfortunately no hidden treasures or perhaps thats actually fortunate in the case of old bottles
DIY,not_removed,usually only happens to areas that have been redeveloped buddy of mine outside of boston had a forensics team tear through the floors of his rental crazy neighbor said there was a body to find ships timbers strung over stone foundation walls some bottles from the but nothing as old as the basic structure circa late oh yeah no human remains found only animal bones as one would expect
DIY,not_removed,i had my doubts to be fair theres been some downpour since we finished this and nearly all of the water actually hits the opening the small amounts that shoot past it is negligible in my opinion the boards are waterproof anyway and theres gravel that serves as draining underneath the other option wouldve been to have the downspout so thats the word i couldnt find go through the deck but that means you cant clean the funnel they tend to fill up with leaves and junk that the water brings with it
DIY,not_removed,at first i thought it could be a glass tile for illumination but it wouldnt make sense to have that in the middle of the roof
DIY,not_removed,in this case i had to apply for a permit the reason being the roof if it werent for that i wouldve been free to build any deck i wanted
DIY,not_removed,i can only estimate i guess around here theyd charge something around € for the work
DIY,not_removed,why would you need bricks
DIY,not_removed,this is from finland indeed thanks for the tip i will keep an eye out for that in the winter im not sure any snow will find its way up there but you never know it might blow in from the sides
DIY,not_removed,the does not include the playhouse and the decking is wooden theres no money left for a proper grill now that this blew the budget nah its not that bad we just havent had time to go grillshopping yet
DIY,not_removed,yes the building authorities demanded that i had a friend of mine who draws building plans for a living help me with that without those i would never ever have dared undertake something like this
DIY,not_removed,first we cast a slab of concrete and let it dry on top of that we cast a smaller pillar of concrete about cm high if i remember correctly while that was drying i inserted a pillar shoe dont know the correct term in english then the columns were screwed into the shoe
DIY,not_removed,yes i believe its mandatory the roofing material is called httpwwwbendersseengbrangeroofingconcreterooftiles
DIY,not_removed,the horizontal bars are snowstoppers yes the ladder is bolted to the wall
DIY,not_removed,no one does that when op actually does a good job just when they fuck it up dangerously
DIY,not_removed,jumping the gun a bit arent ya he did a decent job so no need to tear apart his work unlike some of the other death trap decks that were critiqued to hell
DIY,not_removed,is dirt cheap for a project like that in the states especially considering he did it properly and that he even hired some professional help that could easily be a project
DIY,not_removed,without vat and transportation we had most of it delivered to our doorstep well get down to around or so no the playhouse is not included the largest chunk of the price are the boards covering the whole porch it turns out the ones we wanted were of the more expensive ones generally brown waterproofed are more expensive than green ones and smooth ones are more expensive than err nonsmooth
DIY,not_removed,after looking at this i was like damn i payed for my shitty covered porch
DIY,not_removed,i grew up in the midwest very few houses had fences around their yard
DIY,not_removed,we plan to maybe plant a hedgerow between us and the neighbour in the blue house then again the house was only finished in september meaning the property is still very much under construction
DIY,not_removed,where do you live that all houses have fences
DIY,not_removed,theyre americans they like guns itll all work out in the end
DIY,not_removed,i havent calculated it exactly if we assume it were rectangle shaped and didnt have the part sticking out at the front in the middle we end up at then we subtract some from the corners and add some in the middle and that should make it rather close to for all practical purposes
DIY,not_removed,could you point me to some of those i remember the biggest one that blew up was deleted by the op he used bricks as footings and someone corrected all of his mistakes and it hit bestof a year or two ago
DIY,not_removed,yepdidnt see any joist hangers and the footings seem incredibly shallow but hey looks beautiful man
DIY,not_removed,id be happy to help my neighbors build a privacy wall soundproof that fucker too
DIY,not_removed,any idea why north america insists on the idiotic shingles drives me crazy having to get roofs redone and all the grit that comes off those stupid things
DIY,not_removed,looks like a metal roof with clay tile style
DIY,not_removed,those roof ladders leads me to believe you are from finland i always wondered why so many finnish houses had them but the only answer i got from my relatives was for sneaking out at night
DIY,not_removed,having pulled countless chimney liners through existing tile chimneys i would have given my firstborn to not have to drag ladders around with me
DIY,not_removed,right up until the neighborhood kids end up on your roof
DIY,not_removed,yeah then id have two ladders instead of just the one that goes anywhere
DIY,not_removed,dammit i should have listened
DIY,not_removed,i spy with my little eye
DIY,not_removed,drainage is the opposite of what you want right next to your house especially if you have a basement you want the water to flow away from your house not be drawn to it im speaking from personal experience here and advice from professionals in rectifying a foundation flooding problem
DIY,not_removed,i didnt see it in any of the photos where did you see it that would be tricky to do because they already dug a bit down so they would need an outlet a bit lower than even that for the drainage pipes to have the correct grade
DIY,not_removed,that is correct
DIY,not_removed,i think you are right because of image d
DIY,not_removed,thats exactly what it is
DIY,not_removed,that is the idea the water passes through the gravel and into the soil below the gravel doesnt soak up any of it like sand or mud that means there is never anything that can freeze close to the constructions
DIY,not_removed,id accept that theory if the guy didnt have snow guards the entire length of his roof
DIY,not_removed,but the footings are sitting on soil not gravel
DIY,not_removed,some old glass bottle are actually quite valuable
DIY,not_removed,so if the forensics team tears your house up and finds nothing im guessing they dont pay to fix the damage
DIY,not_removed,there are tons of options just search for downspout filter this is the one i have on my supplies list
DIY,not_removed,solid info thx
DIY,not_removed,in case of rogue wolves
DIY,not_removed,thank you for taking the time to explain
DIY,not_removed,ah interesting nice house btw
DIY,not_removed,the was only for the materials though that does not include the excavator or compensation to some people who helped out i hade one friend who is a construction engineer by trade help out with the blueprints as well as my neighbour help me out nearly every step of the way also he has a lot of power tools anyway that adds to the final sum of the expenses
DIY,not_removed,i grew up in the midwest and nearly every house had fences around their yard your mileage may vary
DIY,not_removed,i have to agree with umadk mostly depends on how far you live from the urban center
DIY,not_removed,anywhere within an hour and a half of a dense urban center fences seem to be the norm less so for urban centers of primarily agriculture oriented regions thats my exp from living in il oh in wi have also lived in chicago and the rockies but those arent representative of the midwest
DIY,not_removed,england never see it here
DIY,not_removed,you mean the one that gets linked in every other diy post now
DIY,not_removed,i remember that post each and every time a new deck gets posted on here since then dude must have been overwhelmed with all the things idd as wrong or not safe dont be that guy your homestore usually has a single book for every type of project on the shelf near the checkout that will keep you from being that guy im likely preaching to the choir but it bears saying
DIY,not_removed,there was the one a couple weeks ago where the railings wouldnt have withstood a slight bump and i believe he had untreated wood making contact with dirt
DIY,not_removed,im not sure if its the same one but there was one one where someone built a deck and someone built a hole in the wall though i cant link you to them
DIY,not_removed,my favorite was the guy who poured an awful concrete stoop slash landing on the front of his house and tried to make light that it wasnt perfect cue all the construction redditors freaking out explaining the catastrophic issues and the narcissistic op disregarding every single negative post
DIY,not_removed,there are definitely joist hangers
DIY,not_removed,yeah at least the new area even used shallow footings the old deck was on blocks i dont know why people will spend thousands on a deck and then not even bother anchoring it to the ground properly where i live we dig minimum treated posts down and then set them in cement its far easier to set post correctly then do it twice because the ground has all shifted years later
DIY,not_removed,kinda looks like florida so footings probably arent required to be sunk
DIY,not_removed,i have a neighbor with a babytoddler that literally screeches every time i hear her i dont know if its colic or what but i spent on freaking windows to block it out yes it was so bad i had to do home improvements and open another loan just to keep my sanity
DIY,not_removed,post there was a housing boom there werent enough skilled workers to install traditional building materials so construction companies adopted new construction methods that required less skilled labor asphalt shingles are easy to install so they became the defacto standard once the housing boom had slowed down people were already used to the new construction methods and more importantly the new construction prices they didnt want to pay to go back to more traditional building methods so people just stuck with it a lot of things came from this time period dry wall slab foundations and platform framing replaced plaster and lathe pier and beam foundations and balloon framing respectively you can also see this happening with pex plumbing its easier to install so a lot of plumbers are moving to pex
DIY,not_removed,they are cheap and readily available metal roofing has been quickly gaining in popularity but shingles still dominate the market
DIY,not_removed,cost and ease of installation everything in life is a trade off
DIY,not_removed,we had a slate roof that lasted like years cant beat them house is years old
DIY,not_removed,or a burgler
DIY,not_removed,there isnt any pictures but i know where op is from and i know how houses are made in that country and what regulations and laws says about that also i am construction worker builder in that country
DIY,not_removed,image nr gives it away as well
DIY,not_removed,i was going to ask this also i understand about the gravel but does the ground not freeze the reason for the plus depth on the east coast in the usa is because of frost heave the ground raises and lowers a bit as it freezes and knocks your deck out of level over time
DIY,not_removed,i understand this but if you have not done a perc test you cant be sure how fast the water will drain and if its cold enough it will freeze before it has a chance to drain into the subgrade source im a civil designer who has dabbles in drainange design
DIY,not_removed,mhmm thats true but unless the footings are sitting on something like clay there will be minimal swelling i was referring to the gravel that is typically placed underneath the deck area
DIY,not_removed,hell no thats what insurance is for this is murica on the plus side an unannounced visit by a forensics team apparently gives you a free pass on boxing your parlor with a water pipe imagine his surprise rips bong sees what appears to be a tac team on other side of door
DIY,not_removed,the excavation was done by a contractor looks like everything else was diy if you count the brackets welded up by a friend as diy
DIY,not_removed,right im saying thats still cheap
DIY,not_removed,was it in a bigger city i grew up in the suburbs of omaha and we hardly had any and my family was all from a small town in iowa and i dont think there was a fence in the whole town
DIY,not_removed,backup copy of a bad deck build
DIY,not_removed,mhmm i dont know why but i smile everything i go through this post ive understood basic construction techniques since i was thanks to being exposed to deck construction and general carpentry my dad explained to me why these things are done so it blew my mind to see how wacky that deck was built
DIY,not_removed,thanks for that i cant believe nobody pointed out the midspan beam splice omg
DIY,not_removed,im missing the links to the book wall post and the dude who tore out a wall the book wall was the best shit was ugly and a terrible idea
DIY,not_removed,yep and that guy was thankful and responsive for the criticism his deck was also up to city code apparently
DIY,not_removed,well there they are obviously missed them the first run through
DIY,not_removed,i dont think that op would need better anchoring in that location that is the way it is usually done here and those are very durable
DIY,not_removed,he priced his project in euros and all measurements were in cm so im guessing not in florida
DIY,not_removed,assumed northern state arent those snow guards on the metal roof
DIY,not_removed,he threw up a british pounds sign on the cost so im thinking either canada or the uk
DIY,not_removed,you seem to think all of the new methods are better as someone who owns a house with plaster balloon framing and traditional pipes i can assure you the new methods are as good or better now i dont see how anybody can complain about pex vs copper
DIY,not_removed,it is kind of weird for me because the majority of middleclass housing in brazil uses reinforced concrete concrete slabs if multiple pavements construction it is expensive but it is also fireproof and lasts essentially forever
DIY,not_removed,metal roofing has been quickly gaining in popularity but shingles still dominate the market indeed it has i should know i recently had mine done metal i fucking hate it with a passion i should have gone shingles
DIY,not_removed,yeah when i have to do it again were doing steel would like to find these clay shingles but im not even sure our roof would support them
DIY,not_removed,you might have just gotten that investment back by now the materials are a ton the roofing needs to be much more substantial for the weight and you pay a lot more when you need maintenance that being said they look much better and i would buy one if money were not an issue
DIY,not_removed,dane here i just looked roof shingles up i think ive seen roofs like that around but im not sure just about everything is ceramic and brick around here
DIY,not_removed,certainly not in sweden maybe in the norrland
DIY,not_removed,or santy clause
DIY,not_removed,yeah i totally agree with you footing depth is to get the footing below where it regularly freezes what hes done here is shallow up his footing and then let the water and cold air get right to the bottom of the footing the only way you can really justify making the footings more shallow is to place them on a foot or more of crushed stone that adds a little flexibility to the ground below the footing and gives the water a place to expand and contract between your footing and where it will freeze hopefully it works out ok for you source structural engineer
DIY,not_removed,in this case i fully trust my construction engineer friend who deemed this approach good enough at this stage i can only hope this is enough
DIY,not_removed,is it because the support feet are so small i dont think i see all the horribleness
DIY,not_removed,well ladida look at mr child deckmaster over here
DIY,not_removed,he took it well but i dont think it was up to city code he was also missing a lot of steel brackets that im sure my city would have required at least
DIY,not_removed,i heard florida took the uks place in the eu
DIY,not_removed,also he mentioned wet snow
DIY,not_removed,im gonna guess canada
DIY,not_removed,dudes not american
DIY,not_removed,that was euros not pounds and canada doesnt use either
DIY,not_removed,not at all i have a balloon framed house with a pier and beam foundation and a metal roof i think drywall is the only thing that is superior to plaster and lathe slab foundations are fine if you dont live in a place with shifting soil copper vs pex depends on the water pex is much better in areas with acidic water copper is better if there are microbes in your water because it is bacteriostatic and pex lets in enough light to allow algae growth
DIY,not_removed,the pex is good stuff i have it in my house everywhere new plumbing work was done however i question how it will last over the years i have complete faith in soldered copper lasting many decades as i have seen very old copper still working with no issue or maintenance
DIY,not_removed,i dont see how anybody can complain about pex vs copper copper will last many decades maybe pretty much forever pex will very gradually decay from chlorine etc found in any city supplied water source pex can be installed in half the time or less than copper so obviously youre gonna get a decent amount of plumbers pushing it
DIY,not_removed,its interesting how different regions have different ways of building stuff where i live the soil is heavy expanding clay it literally looks and feels like something you would make pottery with i always wondered how reinforced concrete would hold up with the constant shifting that the soil does we have lots of problems with buildings leaning over time would the strength and weight of the concrete hold the buildings level or would it crack as the ground shifts underneath it
DIY,not_removed,really im curious why as we are exploring our options right now the only downside ive heard so far was noise during rain
DIY,not_removed,as someone that works with a lot of roofs in the insurance industry look at a decra metal roof thick gauge steel coated in an asphalt spray the asphalt is replaceable and they can withstand a lot of hail damage also individual metal shingles can replaced versus whole sections if you switch to metal roofing talk to your insurance agentcompany you may be qualify for discounts
DIY,not_removed,did not mean to imply that you should purchase one sorry home is years old we have been here years my father had work done on it new roof was put on several years ago god no how could anyone afford a slate roof now a days mom did not want to move as very old fashioned our home new furnanceroofwindows inside and out remodelbad neighborhood but very very stubbornyet some of the winds and storms on this hill yet it standsnot a special home but electrical everything new you did a beautiful and creative joblooks great i really hate those huge huge homes some people built like in the i love cozy and sq feet is all we have and one half acre
DIY,not_removed,dane here never seen that before
DIY,not_removed,i must be completely inept at anything handy because it looks like a regular deck to me lol
DIY,not_removed,definitely read the top comment in the original post that usixthsnes linked
DIY,not_removed,no joists hangers at the ends and it looks like he used small pieces that needed to be joined in the middle with no support underneath them
DIY,not_removed,you have to sink posts into the ground first thing i noticed was how the posts were just resting on rather small blocks resting on the ground lots of potential points of failure ground on a slope like that can morph and move over time not to mention the weight of the deck itself will push on the ground with that design and accelerate the movement the deck might be ok for a few years but will have sagging warping and other problems fairly soon
DIY,not_removed,its been covered below but yes the essential idea is the building does not have a stable foundation for footings sitting a foot plus underground the potential for those to physically move is substantially less
DIY,not_removed,im fine with that
DIY,not_removed,neither does england anymore
DIY,not_removed,i love the sound deadening properties of plaster living in new city apartments i could hear neighbors talking watching tv and of course other activities just moved to an old building with plaster walls and ceilings and i cant hear a thing from neighbors
DIY,not_removed,ive got pex in my house the inspector seemed to be convinced that it was original and its never given me a bit of issue
DIY,not_removed,it may depend on the water where you are my copper pipes only lasted about twenty years due to a combination of shoddy production in the mid and acidic water our water also ate through metal fittings in our garbage disposal in about four years
DIY,not_removed,hm thats an interesting point i hadnt considered the soil in most places ive been in brazil is indeed mostly hard and dry indeed also theres lots of relatively cheap semiskilled labor that does the hard work and i guess this also brings the overall cost down a lot
DIY,not_removed,we have post tensioned slabs in arizona it doesnt crack but you have to be extra careful if you cut into it
DIY,not_removed,noise rain runoff shingles slow down the rain and the gutters work perfectly metal roofs the rain shoots off you will either need wider gutters or a downpipe going down your roof itself if you have multiple levels snow sliding if you get enough of it it doesnt matter if you have those bars or breakers or whatever the hell they are the snow will come off in huge fucking sheets icicles because the snow will melt from the bottom and it is such a smooth surface it will form huge fuckin icicles and ice buildup in the gutters it is a pain in the ass to do maintenance to it will fade eventually if you get a colored one the nails on a shingled roof are all covered over by another layer of shingles on a metal roof all the screws are exposed so if even one wasnt treated or dipped properly leak plus now that i have looked at it for over a year it is ugly as hell
DIY,not_removed,thats an rlifeprotips thanks
DIY,not_removed,his deck is simply resting on the ground did not plant posts below the frost line dont think he sunk posts at all just resting on cinder blocks a stiff breeze will blow it over it will be warped within a year or two also a lot of other problems i cant remember off the top of my head
DIY,not_removed,thanks
DIY,not_removed,england never used the euro
DIY,not_removed,thats mostly cheap drywall thin and not good insulation honestly if its between apartments it should be a double wall but that is both twice as expensive and takes twice as much space
DIY,not_removed,id never even heard of pex until the early i had no idea it was in use back then
DIY,not_removed,hah thats crazy well my point still stands pex would have gotten eaten even faster in your scenario pex is something that should be used when youre trying to pipe through some really wacky space that is begging for some bendable hoses so that you dont go insane
DIY,not_removed,thanks for taking the time to write that i had to look up some of those terms the weeping tile was interesting to me because i had terracotta weeping tile around my house when i bought it but didnt know what it was called
DIY,not_removed,they do asphalt coated metal roofs sounds like that would have solved almost all your issues
DIY,not_removed,corrugated iron and steel roofing is very common in nz australia as are concrete or clay tile in years i never experienced any of those issues if it bothers you there are textured coatings you could look into such as that should slow things down rarely does anyone leave them unpainted and they last for many years im puzzled by the pita to do maintenance to part of your comment as they are known for being very lowmaintenance and the only noise you should hear is the faint drumming of heavy rain which i miss since i now have the asphalt tiles here in the us fibreglass insulation such as httpwwwpinkbattsconz eliminates most noise so maybe you could look into that as well
DIY,not_removed,glad i came across your comment i love the look of the metal roof but you have brought up some very good points
DIY,not_removed,i havent looked at the post but in terms of the frost line could it be that he lives somewhere where there is no frost line surely the frost line in the southwest usa is zero
DIY,not_removed,thank you i knew part of it was the foundation curious to see how it looks now
DIY,not_removed,are we sure about that
DIY,not_removed,the trend is to buy old buildings and do a gut rehab often squeezing an extra bedroom into the space in the process while the units tend to look nice and sometimes have premium features like granite countertops they often opt for laminate flooring thin drywall inexpensive cabinetry and hardware plastic dropin tubs and showers and tiny closets if a tenant damages any of these it is easy and cheap to replace it has really pushed me towards renting directly from owners in condo buildings instead of apartments as some care has been put into the livability of a place instead of just how well it shows
DIY,not_removed,looking online it sounds like it wasnt introduced until so not original but definitely older the ac was installed in and i think they probably did the pex around the same time
DIY,not_removed,asphalt coated metal roofs it is sad that the roofing company never mentioned this now i am even more pissed
DIY,not_removed,provably definitely not an expert check out the post the top comment lists like serious problems with the deck
DIY,not_removed,httpswwwgooglecomsearchqcurrencyofenglandoqcurrencyofengland
DIY,not_removed,so doctor england never used the euro as currency then whats the big hoopla over leaving
DIY,not_removed,the uk was one of the ones holding the eu up with their diplomatic and military power and whatnot the eu is significantly weaker without them thats why the eu let the uk keep their own currency because they demanded it and they have the power to make demands like that
DIY,not_removed,ok yeah i never knew that about the currency thing the other stuff i knew but not the currency
DIY,not_removed,im not a electrician but i would not do this
DIY,not_removed,yes
DIY,not_removed,ive read about this but havent this particular device httpwwwjusthdmicoukhdjuicebox i do use a powerline network at home they arent perfect especially if youre in a flat or user them for long periods of time
DIY,not_removed,you would have to take an hdmi signal convert it to analog send it through the wire then convert it to hdmi if your coding is top notch and you have two badass amplifiers computers and a thick enough cable you can pull it off with a second delay maybe an extension might work better

DIY,not_removed,after replacing the valve it should be connected directly to the gas hose with compound correct
DIY,not_removed,thanks so much this is what i was worried about but at least i know now
DIY,not_removed,flare connections dont use teflon tape or rectoseal sp
DIY,not_removed,i use yellow tape on male very light rectoseal on female pipe thread
DIY,not_removed,how much traffic weight type
DIY,not_removed,use some and build your frame place this on a flat surface with some plastic underneath it to keep the concrete from sticking to the surface sounds like an sack of premix to me but read the bag first reinforcement can be any type of mesh but even something like a bbq grill or an old oven rack would work fine to suspend it wire rocks or chunks of busted brick to the bottom side of the grid if this is to be below ground have a piece of steel bent like a handle so you can lift it out in the future that is also wired to the steel mix cement fill the form important is to let this cure for a minimum of days so it does not crack when you strip it to move into place it is fragile and flexible for at least days now you can move it into place if the plastic is not removable then that is allright to seal it they sell a rubber tape like weatherstrip that comes in various widths but use at least thick to make sure the surface imperfections fill viola easy peasy good luck hope it helps reply if more questions
DIY,not_removed,it is surrounded by bushes so usually small rabbits definitely no humans once in a lifetime a deer i think the old cover was made poorly it broke in half
DIY,not_removed,if anyone is wondering why it took four years heres why a kitchen is a space you use daily i never wanted to rip it all apart at once and be without a kitchen for any extended period of time the slower pace over four years allowed just that longest period of time without a kitchen was about a week during the cabinetcounter install spreading the work over four years also allowed me to not worry about my budget so much the cost was split over many paychecks never had to skimp on materials tools etc
DIY,not_removed,amazing work i really love what you did with the counter tops i have always wanted to do butcher block style but never got around to doing it anyway great attention to detail turned out great
DIY,not_removed,great craftsman and a packer fan way to live
DIY,not_removed,why would the fridge ever have been where it began that was just a terrible place for it its so obvious where its supposed to go
DIY,not_removed,this is outstanding i love the work you did down to the little details hardware for shelving in dining room its fantastic beautiful work and great taste
DIY,not_removed,i am in love with this it looks amazing
DIY,not_removed,damn dude thats almost exactly what i want for my kitchen you may have a replica soon in another house
DIY,not_removed,looks awesome i am gearing up to start a kitchen remodel in my new house and this is really helpful for the sink did you reinforce or add support under it at all or is it just sitting on the counterscabinet beneath
DIY,not_removed,awesome op is there room to add a front plate to the front of the pantry drawers i personally dont like the exposed bottom panel underneath the front board face or the exposed screws otherwise this is awesome and you need more upvotes
DIY,not_removed,i love the white brick and the slidey drawers actually i love all of it
DIY,not_removed,looks awesome man like your style
DIY,not_removed,nice project really inspiring is it normal to connect hot water to a dish water in europe dish waters are connected with cold water as far as i know
DIY,not_removed,normally i wouldnt like wooden countertops but yours looks absolutely phenomenal awesome job
DIY,not_removed,this in full is exactly what i did not need to see
DIY,not_removed,wow really awesome job can you estimate how much the countertops cost roughly also the mario star on the christmas tree how can i convince my wife that it is a necessity
DIY,not_removed,oh man i love that yellow color on the walls do you remember what it is
DIY,not_removed,i have to admit i was looking for ceiling cat in nice remodel op
DIY,not_removed,i would have made a trap door in the bottom of the pantry for treats
DIY,not_removed,congratulations sir very impressive work i like how you went the extra effort with everything esp the plumbing that will go such a long way my wife and i also bought a fixer upper and after years of replacing drywall doing baseboards casing crown tiling walls and floors we are just about done just in time for our daughter coming in late october lifeisgood congrats again
DIY,not_removed,looks amazing the only think i would of of done differently was used a pocket screw system on the drawers to hide the screws
DIY,not_removed,four years
DIY,not_removed,looks like it took you years to move the fridge
DIY,not_removed,when i bought my house the kitchen was unusable so had to be immediately gutted i had a working stove and fridge and built a temporary stand for the old sink that was plumbed but the cabinets took months to arrive so i had no counters or cabinets for months it was horrible but now i have a new appreciation for the little things in life like a silverware drawer also i now believe anyone moving into a tiny house is a straight up lunatic
DIY,not_removed,ya did good
DIY,not_removed,just curious is butcher block countertop able to be used as a cutting board
DIY,not_removed,gigantic packer fan first craftsman second
DIY,not_removed,yes i was so pleased to see it moved i saw the first picture and was silently repeating please move the fridge please move the fridge i was very glad to not be disappointed
DIY,not_removed,awesome glad to inspire please send some pictures when youre done
DIY,not_removed,the bulk of the sinks weight is sitting on the counters and cabinets its reinforced with two l brackets that fit under the sink basin and attach to the inside walls of the cabinet they came with the sink i also used loctite in around the sink lip which acts as both an adhesive and sealant its water tight and wont budge
DIY,not_removed,yes there is ive thought about it as well im actually more concerned with using an extended front plate to hide the rollers and the screws would be a bonus then again youre talking to a guy who doesnt mind black pipe sticking out of the wall for shelving
DIY,not_removed,thats interesting i believe some dishwashers can heat their own water but im not sure if mine can i think its heating element is meant to boost already hot water to regardless i do know from a thermal energy stand point the higher the temperature of a cleaning solution the more dirt can enter figured it best to run hot water to the dishwasher
DIY,not_removed,raw wood was around wood glue clamps already had sand paper planing waterlox etc are all extra costs as far as the star dont ask permission rather tell her its happening
DIY,not_removed,thanks its behr color summer harvest
DIY,not_removed,you know its ok to be gay we can all tell just be confortable with yourself no need to harass others because of personal insecurities
DIY,not_removed,technically yes but im in the process of making a cutting board to use on the counter worked way to hard on the counter to dice it up
DIY,not_removed,lol mine will be much like yours more than one or two years in the making i have to knock a stupidly wide chimney down in order to start the project lol
DIY,not_removed,great thanks for the info
DIY,not_removed,dude the black pipe is choice its just unfortunate screwheads and drawer rollers arent in style
DIY,not_removed,i think its heating element is meant to boost already hot water to correct mostly as a sanitize step in the rinse at least for my dishwasher in the us it is presumed you run the hot water line not cold i think the cold supply line idea from europe is that you cut down on water heater costs standby losses etc by only heating the gallons used during the cycle kitchen looks awesome btw nice work
DIY,not_removed,dish washers in europe heats the cold water to desired temperature this way cold water can be used to clean the dishes from leftover soap when hot water is the only input you will use hot water for the last round of the dish washers programwich looks like a waste depending of the cost of hot water not really sure how its work with dish washers in us
DIY,not_removed,thank you its such a gorgeous kitchen you did an awesome job for the small space and who cares if it took years it took me almost a year to remodel a small bathroom
DIY,not_removed,i know they sell butcher block counters at ikea was it cheaper to build your own
DIY,not_removed,how dare you install a wine fridge andor oven in the chimney cavity instead
DIY,not_removed,huh for my specifically state using a hot water supply
DIY,not_removed,no much more expensive to build again part of the reason i spread this out over four years was to mitigate costs and not have to cheap out on materials ikeas counters are fine but arent solid hardwood theyre a mix of wood and laminate the counters i built are solid ash ash is a super hard wood and should perform better as a counter than ikeas laminate mix especially with the sealer and finish i used im not sure how ikeas are finished
DIY,not_removed,youve never seen my kitchen the chimney is what makes the kitchen lose half its potential size its feet wide with a foot shoot
DIY,not_removed,interesting didnt know that
DIY,not_removed,great job yours looks great
DIY,not_removed,solid and solid although they are only thick
DIY,not_removed,that sounds like what makes your kitchen awesome
DIY,not_removed,cool good value then no regrets on building with the thick ash though
DIY,not_removed,having the back of a chimney taking up all the space my walking space in my kitchen is around feet
DIY,not_removed,lets see it nothing like getting some different opinons my kitchens wicked small too and im trying to figure out how to redo it as well
DIY,not_removed,ill have to do it at work i have a picture there remind me if i dont reply by the afternoon
DIY,not_removed,hi there is steemitcom on a banned domain list i own this content i appreciate using reddit so i want to make sure my account is in good standing thanks for your help
DIY,not_removed,could get two basic cardboard boxes one slightly larger than the other cut the top off of the small one and cut the lid off the bigger one use wrapping paper or spray can to color the outside of the boxes to cover the boxes good luck
DIY,not_removed,excuse the shitty diagram but i saw one of these boxes that someone had made as a joke and it was built like

DIY,not_removed,yeah i would google that it would be out there somewhere from that video i would guess the white things attached at the bottom of the lid is the confetti bomb
DIY,not_removed,mini incites childs sugar rush
DIY,not_removed,if you put a stringer across the bottom at each leg position with an angled bevel at each end that will allow you to have secure connection to the solid edges of the panel with the stringers and solid connection of the pipe leg flanges to the stringers stinger stock of poplar or other wood that holds screws well cut about an inch short of the width of the door with the end edge that is bottom not against the door beveled or eased
DIY,not_removed,if you make this youll never hear the end of knockknock jokes
DIY,not_removed,ever heard of countersunk machine screws youd drill from the top down and completely through the door put the four screws flush with the top and place the pipe fitting underneath use some locknuts to secure the whole assembly together
DIY,not_removed,that sounds great how thick do you think the solid part is around the edge
DIY,not_removed,the last door that i had occasion to disassemble it was on the sides and at top and bottom often you can tell by looking at the httpimgurcomaoopbz
DIY,not_removed,thanks again
DIY,not_removed,thats a pretty sick looking lineup
DIY,not_removed,thanks its tons of fun so its easy to get carried away
DIY,not_removed,excellent job though i have my doubts that this is your first woodworking job i was looking for your mistakes and other than sanding in the house you didnt make any so here you need one of of these great build
DIY,not_removed,beautiful really nicely done one thing youll have to do something to accommodate wood expansion along the width of the slab at least it didnt look like it but apologies if i missed it attaching legs across the grain like this puts stress on the piece in a way that will eventually lead to cracking one potential solution is to make the holes in the legs oval so the bolts can move along with the wood when it expandsshrinks with seasonal changes
DIY,not_removed,really like how it came out congrats can i ask how much the steel legs cost ya and yeabest never to sand indoors if you can help it
DIY,not_removed,theres nothing better than the first time you put the coating on the wood and that dark grain pops black walnut is beautiful and fun to work with wearing a mask when sanding is essential as the walnut will cause allergic reactions to most people and can trigger wild headaches and sinus issues
DIY,not_removed,its beautiful and you should be mega happy with it but im mostly jealous at how banging your living room looks that exposed brick
DIY,not_removed,looks like bacon rapped in chocolate
DIY,not_removed,ever since i was introduced to black walnut i am in love with it great job
DIY,not_removed,im also new to woodworking and have been thinking about a project similar to yours can you tell me about the oil process and staining
DIY,not_removed,where did you buy the slab from id love to get one like that for personal projects
DIY,not_removed,nice i have a feeling though it co do with more sanding oiling to get the surface to look even it seems a bit patchy to me
DIY,not_removed,first lol at the gif ive done it holy shit i just looked up tool library and omg i want to start one here in south florida what a great idea i have to look into this fantastic idea
DIY,not_removed,id recommend choosing one hole to keep circular and then oversize the other three this will anchor the top so it doesnt shift around while still allowing for expansion fyi wood growsshrinks with humidity changes across the grain so depending on where you live this could be a big deal or no problem the worst areas are states that have cold winters and humid summers the humidity difference in a year is huge there is little change in the length of the wood so that dimension is much more stable
DIY,not_removed,one thing you will find working with wood its not all that difficult to make something look good when you build it thats because it looks good under those particular temperature and humidity conditions in months if the wood was not properly dried when you built this you will probably start to see problems with expansion and contraction of the wood just keep it in mind for the next project wood takes on and loses water to its environment and this has a noticeable effect on how the wood looks and interacts with other pieces of wood it is attached to
DIY,not_removed,where did you get the slab from
DIY,not_removed,i hope you oiled both sides as others were talking about with the wood expandingcontracting with humidity changes it can also warp if the piece only has a finish on one side this is because its easier for moisture to get inout on one side or the other and so that side expands or contracts faster than the other beautiful job though looks great you also mentioned maybe putting a coat of epoxy on i really like the look and effect of the epoxy especially with a piece where you left the bark on left untreated the bark will dry out and fall off but the epoxy can seal it all in and hold it together if youre looking for an example of what it might look like you can see a couple pictures of a clock i made here just use a cheap disposable chip brush to work the epoxy into all the nooks and crevices of the bark i can take some more detailed pics of the edges if you like
DIY,not_removed,did i see rust on a weld already you may want to put some sort of coating over those if so
DIY,not_removed,black walnut is also very stable and doesnt expandcontract as much during moisture and temperature changes
DIY,not_removed,well explained fbd op wood expands very little along its long grain you have two independent legs no stretcher or shelf etc you are good there as far as wood movement when i do a project like this i make the holes in the steel look more like little caplets rather than circles so that the wood can move a little perpendicular to the long grain if a project is solid wood it is going to move some species move more than others seasonally there are several wood movement calculators online you can use
DIY,not_removed,upper weld here looks orange maybe just the lighting
DIY,not_removed,heres the thing it might be fine but youve done too good of a job to let it tear up id do a bit of research on accounting for wood movement on tables and maybe adjust how you attached the legs
DIY,not_removed,if you didnt over tighten the screws taking them out and putting them back in once should be fine this is a case where theyre not going to have to withstand that much force ive taken screws in and out of particle board dozens of time on table legs that were putting up with a lot more weight and lateral motion than this is ever going to see that said if youre worried about it or if when you put thing together again you feel a lot of play in the screws then you can simply use a wider diameter screw its a simple thing to change as for whether or not you should take it all apart and widen the holes in the legs i cant say for sure i dont have that much experience with walnut but considering the time and expense you put into it for me i probably wouldnt risk letting it tear itself apart i know it can be frustrating to have to take things apart again but you likely wont notice anything wrong until its too late its always cheaper to prevent a problem than to fix one

DIY,not_removed,i agree theres a reason he didnt let on dont overwhelm him just tell him what youd like and tell him youll buy what he needs and let him go
DIY,not_removed,yeah do this d
DIY,not_removed,recently bought a fixer upper and replaced the shotty linoleum with wood look tile because there was a significant height difference i took out the metal piece under the door that leads to the garageand the wood that is under it my plan was to raise the whole thing to the height of the new floor i was going to drill pilot holes in a hammer into existing nails the nails are permanently in the concrete with some construction adhesive under it then sand it to be flush with the new tile then i was going to give the metal piece a fresh coat of paint and screw it back in i have since been told that this was totally the wrong thing to do is this not going to hold up what should i do instead
DIY,not_removed,if i understand correctly the piece you are talking about is referred to as a threshold you can actually buy replacements and trim them to fit set them to height and grout into place if wanted anyway good luck
DIY,not_removed,whats the condition of the metal piece you took off do you still have itare you planning on reusing it
DIY,not_removed,i dont see a big issue with most of what you said use a pressure treated anchor it into the concrete with some tapcons they are by far the best concrete anchor ive ever used the construction adhesive is a good idea too just wouldnt trust the rusty nails and i feel like you might have a hard time getting the to secure itself to the nails then paint your threshold and put it back in place
DIY,not_removed,yes i guess the term is threshold however the real problem is that i took out the wood underneath not really a standard thing to do my so was not pleased when i ripped it out but what can i say i like perfection and it wasnt level to new floor i laid
DIY,not_removed,yesit just needs to be cleaned up and given a fresh coat of paint
DIY,not_removed,i agree with this use an angle grinder with a cutoff blade to get rid of those nails then rebuild everything using pressure treated or and tapcon them into the cement you can use liquid nails if you want but you probably dont need to then once you have everything rebuilt you can replace the threshold and put some sort of trim planks on the sides if needed cedar or redwood to dress it up as they are very weather resistant but look nicer than pressure treated pine
DIY,not_removed,thanks i have never used tapcons i will check this out about how long do you recommend i use i am going through the wood and concrete with them is this right
DIY,not_removed,i see well you can either u put wooden fillers under it for a base or like i said use a grout good luck
DIY,not_removed,thanks what do you mean by trim planks on the sides sounds like a nice finish but not visualizing what you mean
DIY,not_removed,pressure treated pine will also likely eat up that metal threshold over time due to its high concentration of copper in the preservative if the threshold were to be placed right on the pt youd want some sort of barrier like vycor flashing to keep the metal from touching it
DIY,not_removed,correct they are a concrete specific screw by far the best one ive used id get one that will anchor at least an inch into the concrete so if youre going through a or should be enough they will hold a lot of weight so buy the smallest package you can get be sure to use the apropriate sized drill bit and pre drill the wood and concrete it would be preferred to use a hammer drill but for drilling a small hole you might get away with using a regular drill and a lot of pressure tapcon also makes bits which are very good
DIY,not_removed,i wasnt sure if you were just planning on just repairing the threshold or if you were planning on building one step below it also sort of seemed like a step right outside the door was there before since the area below the threshold looked damaged also
DIY,not_removed,and by over time you mean years right i dont think the copper will be an issue
DIY,not_removed,youre awesome thanks so much thought i destroyed the whole garage this is a perfect fix
DIY,not_removed,gotcha no the whole thing is just a half step down into the garage i think the angle of photo and unclean area is deceiving work in progress
DIY,not_removed,the acq treatment that theyre using in pressure treated wood can eat through a nail httpwwwdeckmagazinecomdesignconstructionfightingfastenercorrosiono under the right conditions some places are switching over to all ground contact pt lumber which has a higher acq concentration copper and aluminum are especially reactive while this is not a structural installation like a stairway or a deck and since its indoors where it wont be exposed to much moisture it is less of an issue its just something to consider a little piece of flashing or a coat of enamel paint on the underside of the threshold could mean he doesnt have to do this again in his lifetime
DIY,not_removed,oh i was confused that door is from the house to the garageand i thought it was from the garage to outdoors now it all makes sense
DIY,not_removed,to your idea over time i believe youll find that cork board will lose structure theyre really meant to be mounted to another surface another idea years ago i was in the same position as youre in today i went to the store and purchased one of those threetiered spice racks the while plastic kind that can expand and contract to fit whatever space you have i then glued black felt to it and used that to display my geode and geode slice collection
DIY,not_removed,ulordcornish is correct about holding up with that cardboard backing in addition to their suggestion you could find a cheap picture frame of a similar size toss in some matteboard to fill out gaps around the edges if needed and adhere a thin piece of hobbygrade plywood on the back for structure since youre renting and likely want to avoid holes in the walls an inexpensive easel would add an interesting touch to your diy display
DIY,not_removed,i think youre overthinking this what happens if it fails you fall several inches thats not going to injure anyone i have a hard time imagining those failing under this kind of application but if they do its not the end of the world
DIY,not_removed,if each riser is rated to then with ten of them they can support thats a pretty decent amount you should be fine for dynamic loads even if its of thats still minus for the bed leaves you with that would be fine for most average weight people my girlfriend and i raised our bed with four thick wood blocks i didnt secure them at all we just have the bed sitting on them no movement or issues at all you shouldnt have any problems with risers specifically designed for the job
DIY,not_removed,cant help your problem but i can give you an anecdotal story had these in our old apartment on a standard queen mattressbox spring combo lasted us for years and never felt anything but sturdy but one day the wife and i were running around and being stupid in the house playing around and i kind of tackled her into the foot of the bed and both legs punched right through the plastic we have a combined weight of but the force of us hitting was enough to break through both leg risers i know its just anecdotal but wanted to at least share my experience
DIY,not_removed,you have a platform bed with a box spring if its already that high why not ditch the box spring and do ikea expeditkallax with slats over top this is what i did and i have tons of storage space
DIY,not_removed,youre probably right as far as injuries to people gobut there are two other things to consider breakingdamaging the stuff were trying to store underneath the bed and if god forbid one of our dogs wandered underneath and the bed collapsed the chances of happening are very very lowwould only really be a concern when were away and family stays at the house to housesit and dogsit but its enough of a concern to cause me to overthink it could happen any time we have guests over and they are using the room in the end youre probably right that im overthinking it i have a tendency to do that but i just wanted to get some opinions and thoughts from the community
DIY,not_removed,thats what i wasnt sure of if it was a matter of just adding the weight limit for each riser together to get the total weight limit or if there were more advanced calculations that needed to be done
DIY,not_removed,we wanted enough room to put the christmas tree and ornaments under it there wasnt quite enough with the bed and legs on the floorthe risers give us enough room to put the tree under and also the totes with ornaments something like that would be great for storing smaller items but it wouldnt allow us to keep the tree underneathplus it would cost a whole lot more im guessing than the i spent on the sets of bed risers not to mention wed have to figure out what to do with the box spring its a tempurpedic box spring mattress set im not prepared to just ditch half of italso i believe tempurpedic voids the warranty if you dont use the box spring along with the mattress not sure on that though i will say thisthe damn thing is really high as we have it right now ill take some pictures later
DIY,not_removed,beautiful time to grab a glass of scotch neat and admire your work
DIY,not_removed,this is a functional timeless and visually appealing piece of furniture good job
DIY,not_removed,nice job that turned out fantastic
DIY,not_removed,surly solid
DIY,not_removed,very nice work how do you like your rigid table saw i need to upgrade my crappy saw and am thinking about getting that one
DIY,not_removed,looks very clean nice job
DIY,not_removed,stunning
DIY,not_removed,thank you
DIY,not_removed,i am a fan of it however the new design only has wheels vs so if i were going to buy new i would look at the delta from lowes as everything i hear is that it has a superior fence
DIY,not_removed,make two places for them build a conventional sand box with raised edges fill it with play sand and them them get in it then build a pit table for them to use some of the kinetic sand to make smaller projects keep the table with the ks on the patio or some place similar
DIY,not_removed,thats how its sometimes done at playgrounds helps keep the sand clean when different grades dont get mixed also putting a tarp or similar cover over the sand when its not used helps to keep animals and debris like tree leaves away you really dont want your three year old to ask daddymommy whats this while holding a coprolite of animal feces in hisher hands
DIY,not_removed,your timescale is no way possible ripping up the carpets removing the gripper strips pulling out all the staples and cleaning up will take you a weekend alone you will need to have a dumpster on site for the scrap once you have the floor cleared then each room will take you hours to sand you need a floor sander plus corneredge sanders and grit if stained if good condition then you could do just the finer grits you need to use the dust from the grit pass along with epoxy resin to fill any holes or gaps this will take over night to cure spot sant the fixes then do the pass a stain is like a watery paint it sits on the surface of the wood a dye soaks into the wood i preferred using a dye i then used good diamond hard polyurethane varnish dont use a brush to appy the varnish there are special mop heads you can use this is all covered in a multitude of youtube videos spend a weekend going through those you will learn a lot more than what can be posted here
DIY,not_removed,are you positive there is hardwood flooring underneath the carpet also days is not a reasonable timetable to coats of poly will take days just for drying time
DIY,not_removed,also are you you dont just have osb or plywood under the carpet how old is your home because stained osb or plywood sounds ghetto as fuck
DIY,not_removed,rip up the carpet then decide on a timeline it all depends on what you find under it
DIY,not_removed,weeks is more like it mask up when tearing out the carpet funky thing live in and under old carpets
DIY,not_removed,i also agree with others here who are saying to expect a longer timetable rent a drum sander and an edger especially for such a large space also figure out what kind of wood the floors are if they are pine or douglas fir i would highly recommend staying away from a poly finish and using an oilbased penetrative finish like waterlox poly doesnt hold up well because it doesnt flex with softwoods and youll find that it cracks and separates from the floor over time edit not a waterlox rep just an old house owner with pine floors
DIY,not_removed,youre very ambitious this will take much longer than you think unless youre on meth
DIY,not_removed,sounds like youre in way over your head for a first diy i have flipped multiple houses in the past several years and i can tell you right off the bat at years old good physical health the right tools and everything going as planned it would take me well over a days to do this project im no professional but neither are you by the sound of it ive done similar projects more than enough to know that if you dont give yourself full weeks to finish this project you are going to be kicking yourself in the ass later my suggestion would be to make an attempt to do one room and see how that goes before you get yourself between a rock a hard place as far as materials and tools are concerned i wont be much help but i just want you to be prepared for the shit show youre gonna get yourself into
DIY,not_removed,i grew up refinishing hardwood floors this job will take a professional three man crew one full week to complete your timeline does not stand a chance sorry for the bad news other posters are right you will really have no idea what you are dealing with until the carpet is up reevaluate then good luck sometimes diving in over your head is the only way to get something accomplished it always works out one way or another
DIY,not_removed,thanks everyone for great responses so its clear i was kidding myself in thinking i would be done in days so i am mentally ready to take days on each process now the thing is finding out the products to buy for stain and poly and how much of it avg room size is of those plus couple of passages any suggestions

DIY,not_removed,pulling out all the staples making sure that they are all gone so you dont destroy a a sanding belt plus filling up all of those holes and bleaching the inevitable black splotches left when a previous owner or renters dog peed on the floor would take in itself at least a week
DIY,not_removed,thanks for an indepth response i went through many videos on youtube and many articles i thought id be able to remove carpets in about hours hour per room and about hours of cleaning after that probably do that at night on thursday and friday i was going to rent square sander and just do sanding whole day on saturday i was then going to do one stain coat in evening then come back the next morning and do one more coating and then put on couple of poly layers on it the only thing i am unsure on from your response is the fillers can you tell me how to do that and what is the process for it
DIY,not_removed,thanks man i am not sure if its plywood under the carpet i think its not because the living room used to have carpet too before we ripped that out so bedroom should have the same floor
DIY,not_removed,i really dont think weeks is going to happen thats way too much
DIY,not_removed,i appreciate your enthusiasm tsigo i really do but youve forgotten rule of home renovation nothing ever gets done on time or within budget this is going to take longer than you plan guaranteed as for the difference in stain you might want to read about the comparison here water based is quicker to apply has a short drying time and easier to clean up after oil base takes longer between coats clean up requires solvent and you need to ventilate while it is drying on the other hand oil based is much more durable
DIY,not_removed,it is not uncommon to find holes or other faults that need to be rectified before you stain and varnish by using the dust from the sanding and mixing it with epoxy you can fill these defects the dust will take up the stain
DIY,not_removed,should unless at some point the old plank decking was pulled out and replaced for one reason or another best of luck to you and always account for the amount of time you think it will take this isnt your job you dont do it every day so things will take longer and may not be up to snuff
DIY,not_removed,well ive been a contractor for years but what do i know
DIY,not_removed,thank you i have basically from nov to nov to do this i am hoping i am able to finish this in that time i will start ripping the carpets out the same day i hope i can do it i am just curious about quality of the products i should use
DIY,not_removed,yep that is basically what i am hearing i have more weeks to plan everything out and figure out the timing
DIY,not_removed,i am not being an ass buddy just saying based on what i have read thanks for your responses
DIY,not_removed,in your title you asked for frugal i think that would limit your choices quite a bit it is my experience that many products that cost more provide a better product price is dictated by the cost of the raw materials the cost of manufacture and the cost to ship to the warehouse as the creator of the product you can do almost nothing about the shipping and it gets to a point where the manufacturing processed has been as streamlined as its ever going to be so that leaves us with the cost of the raw materials what can they leave out or substitute and still get you to purchase their product so select a price point then do your due diligence on researching the many companies that offer the products you are interested in you should be able to narrow down your choices to two or three of them then come back and ask what experience the hivemind has with those items hopefully you can find something you like at a price you can afford
DIY,not_removed,cheers good luck with your project its gonna look fantastic
DIY,not_removed,each stage of that takes about days i recently did square feet in my house and it took nearly a week all said and done and it wasnt the first time ive done it it sounds like you have a lot more floor space youre trying to do too youll probably spend more than a day just ripping out the carpet pads and tack strips and then cleaning the floors enough to even do anything especially if theres furniture in the rooms that needs to be removed its definitely doable but im not sure it is in your time line unless the house is empty you have help you work on it hours per day and absolutely nothing goes wrong in the process
DIY,not_removed,very nice
DIY,not_removed,they are beautiful
DIY,not_removed,yeah awesome love the shot with the ancient map underneath
DIY,not_removed,i love these do you sell them because you should
DIY,not_removed,these are really nice my wedding ring is carbon fibre and american rose wood its wearing out youve inspired me to make my new one
DIY,not_removed,this is the perfect tutorial im a long time wood working hobbyist taught by my father and my grandfather my partner recently told me that should would love a wood engagement ring instead of a worthless diamond im going to pm you with questions thanks again for sharing
DIY,not_removed,very cool thanks for sharing
DIY,not_removed,i do pm me if interested
DIY,not_removed,is it the surface of the wood is it wood or the water based stain that prevented the stain from absorbing its hard to see any wood grain but it could just be my pc
DIY,not_removed,i hadnt seen many posts changing the color of the ikea gerton table top or its bigger cousin the butcherblock table top so i hope this helps everywhere i read claimed that beech was really hard to stain due to blotchiness but i think the biggest thing that kept my coloring even was proper sanding followed by cleaning all dust off with mineral spirits
DIY,not_removed,the kind of stain you chose helped immensely with the blotchyness its more of a surface pigment than a penetrating stain
DIY,not_removed,absolutely i was originally going to go with the varathane onestep stain but i think this was the right choice
DIY,not_removed,what you will need leather razor cutting mat stitch groover optional edge beveler optional dye contact cement needle and thread awl or another way to punch holes ill be around if anyone has any comments or questions hope you like it
DIY,not_removed,i have so much trouble getting a nice even line with my stitch groover on leather especially near the edge where i find it tends to have more stretch what is your secret
DIY,not_removed,
DIY,not_removed,awesome
DIY,not_removed,what sort of groover are you using if the edge is straight you should be able to just follow it down using the guide
DIY,not_removed,
DIY,not_removed,check out the wallets on this website and see if you like them i backed this guy on kickstarter back in or i dont remember the exact date but ive been using his wallets ever since im able to hold around cards plus cash in between each leather piece httptengsupplycom
DIY,not_removed,there are three cards in each of the pockets and money in the middle large part
DIY,not_removed,awesome gif
DIY,not_removed,i was actually able to figure it out last night after posting this it had just gotten dull with use and so no longer had enough bite thanks though
DIY,not_removed,thats awesome it looks nice and neat as if it was meant to be
DIY,not_removed,not saying they dont get warm using them but you do know youre supposed to leave that plastic cover off when youre using it right then they get passive airflow with the outside air the fan setup might be more effective but just figured there was a chance you might have been putting that back on before so i thought i would mention it
DIY,not_removed,thats is cool how well does it work

DIY,not_removed,good to hear you should look into what it would take to make and sell those i bet you would have some customers
DIY,not_removed,wow good delivery op the noise level is definitely not a problem
DIY,not_removed,i think total cost of parts here is over bucks if i designed a proprietary board for it then maybe maybe a fun school project but not right now p
DIY,not_removed,wheres the step by step
DIY,not_removed,well done for a paper clip did you sterilize the thread and clip first
DIY,not_removed,by not flagging it as nsfw most users get a thumbnail preview also why a paperclip seems needlessly painful also i hope you didnt use thread because thread has wicking properties it can make keeping it clean very difficult i would recommend monofilament fishing line if you arent going to seek professional help alternatively ask a hospital for a sutures and a surgical needle its probably the safest option as its sterile and intended for this exact purpose full disclosure ive no idea if a hospital would sell or give you these things but they give junkies clean syringes so its worth a shot
DIY,not_removed,nsfw remember
DIY,not_removed,uhm can u tag that gore and is it supposed to be on rfrugal rnohealthinsurancelol
DIY,not_removed,believe me you do not want to see that
DIY,not_removed,because america
DIY,not_removed,yup in boiling water
DIY,not_removed,just tagged nsfw its my left hand how important can it be i had paperclip but no needle i had thread but no fishing line good tip though will update if hand falls off i might have watched too much mcgyver as a child
DIY,not_removed,the title didnt tip you off
DIY,not_removed,how the hell am i supposed to know how to do it if your dont show the process this is rdiy by the way
DIY,not_removed,my man
DIY,not_removed,your call if it starts to smell or turn yellow or black i would head to the hospital if it gets infected and left it can lead to the infection reaching the bone and in that case it really can cost you a hand
DIY,not_removed,i was jk i dont care but im sure someone does
DIY,not_removed,you can see the thumbnail nsfw hides it
DIY,not_removed,insert thread on sterilized paperclip and sew like the wind the step by step involves much vomiting
DIY,not_removed,oui chef my whole family is emts so ive heard the horror stories and i know what to look for so far so good but great advice nonetheless
DIY,not_removed,fair enough good with paperclips bad with reddit
DIY,not_removed,i need you to do it again and take some pictures
DIY,not_removed,fair enough stay safe
DIY,not_removed,hahahahaha why do you hate me
DIY,not_removed,i could ask the same of you what if i get cut real bad and all i got is some sterile paper clips huh
DIY,not_removed,hahaha then you at least know you are able to save yourself a few hundred dollars as long as you have something to bite down hard on
DIY,not_removed,maybe add way ball valve on the shopvac side as a way of reducing suction power as an experiment try putting a piece of tubing cardboard tube between the shopvac and vortex and cut a hole in it to add a leak and see if it improves performance
DIY,not_removed,how tight is the seal around the cyclone to the lid and the lid to the can things need to be pretty well sealed for it to work how full is the can above about it starts to lose its effectiveness pretty rapidly
DIY,not_removed,using a gallon as well and all makes it into the bucket as supposed to up to when its full no issues in two years
DIY,not_removed,the can is totally empty cyclone to the lid is as air tight as i can make it completely coated in silicone the lid to the can i have weather stripping to seal it for what its worth if i totally block the nozzle the shop vac can collapse the trash can so i feel that is about as air tight as i can get it edit thank you for your help much appreciated
DIY,not_removed,not sure what else to suggest then i have a dust deputy like that but on a gallon bucket and the same ridgid shopvac and it works great
DIY,not_removed,fair enough the only thing i can think of is that maybe there is simply to much air volume in the trash can so the shop vac tries to grab onto that first i just didnt want to use a gallon bucket as i feel i would have to empty it constantly do you find yourself having to stop working to empty it alot thanks again
DIY,not_removed,if i were working in my shop full time id probably empty it once a week maybe twice i dont know if its worth it for you to try it with a smaller container but thats one of the major differences between our setups so maybe it would have an effect
DIY,not_removed,yea thats my guess boo on their website oneida have theirs shown with a gallon steel drum maybe there is a limit to the size of the cyclone vs the size of the collection container hence why you see larger systems with a much larger cyclone
DIY,not_removed,maybe try putting baffles under the cyclone pretty much anything to make it harder for air to travel into the cyclone from below while still having enough room for dust to fall through if youre feeling particularly industrious perhaps a homebrew
DIY,not_removed,its for sex
DIY,not_removed,a beam like this is used to keep the walls from falling outward or at least wanting to this is what used to be called a hand stacked roof at the peak there is a ridge beam that runs the length of the room supported by a couple of boards until each individual roof jack is cut and set this was commonplace before truss manufacturing became popular the weight of the roof and gravity pushing downward will make the walls want to tip outwards at their top letting the roof come on down this beam is doing the same thing that the heel on a manufactured truss doesit keeps the truss from wanting to spread and collapse not just to hold sheetrock and light fixtures on the top side you need to open that beam up and see what actually is in there for support a lot of the structural has already been cut away for rounding it if its just a couple of that have been boxed in to look bigger then no not strong enough lagging into the top plates of the wall might be an option for a true hammock as you would just need to lengthen the end roping system am not an engineer just a builder with many years under his belt repost when you open the top up and see what is under that sheetrock cut the top so it patches and hides easily
DIY,not_removed,drilling holes for a couple bolts wouldnt significantly affect a beam that size on related note im not a structural engineer but unless theres something im not seeing i dont think that beam actually supports your roof in any way it just looks like some sort of cross member to give stability to the rafters
DIY,not_removed,hammock heh
DIY,not_removed,i am having a hard time envisioning how you would hang it from a beam a hammock is hung from two vertical posts that provide the headroom between them for usable space for the hammock the suspension lines should be at a angle how do you get that from a horizontal beam and still be able to use it
DIY,not_removed,thanks a mill this is great ill try to cut the top tonight and check whats inside
DIY,not_removed,thanks a lot if its just giving stability to the rafters does that make much of a difference
DIY,not_removed,i would say you may want to open up the drywall a bit and see how big the beam actually is if it is that big i would agree in saying a couple bolts wont affect it in any way
DIY,not_removed,oh yeah im picking up what youre putting down
DIY,not_removed,good luck repost results for more advice
DIY,not_removed,does having it make a difference again not a structural engineer but i dont really think so since there are no vertical members supporting the roof i believe those are just scissor joists which are engineered in a such a way that the weight of the roof is distributed between three points the peak and the two walls on either side up above the drywall where the slope of your ceiling flattens there is likely a very large beam running the length of your house or at least the length of the scissor joists why the crossmember beam is there assuming thats what its for i have no idea they make much larger scissor joists that can cover a wider expanse without vertical support than what you have there and ive never seen them with a beam going across like that there could be another reason for it a beam that large likely cost hundreds of dollars at least so i doubt they didnt have a good reason for it
DIY,not_removed,i installed a gas range with permit a few years back black iron pipe came up through the basement into the cabinet beneath the range inside the cabinet it connected to a shut off valve and then a flex line connected the range to the shut off valve this passed inspection in nj
DIY,not_removed,that is always the best way but some of these gas companies are using the flex yellow stainless just plain ask your gasplumbing inspector what is their standard the cost of either is very negligible
DIY,not_removed,i just chatted with the inspector i am mn based i guess the rule of thumb is within mn is copper through the cabinet and flex line has to be exposed i have the yellow stainless right now thats part of why it didnt pass code
DIY,not_removed,this is a good guide

DIY,not_removed,ill be following this very closely
DIY,not_removed,use green treated or synthetic for everthing get screws of appropriate size for your chosen lumber that a rated for outdoor use check out link that graphic basically shows how it all gets laid out deck goes on trusses which goes on main supports which are held up by posts which are anchored in concrete the next link when i googled build a porth is also pretty good httpwwwlowescomprojectsporchdeckandpatiodesignandbuildadeckarticle i bet the third is useful too
DIY,not_removed,use a ledger board attached to the foundation of the house as the base for everything in a small deck it seems like overkill but if you do that part right youll do it all right dont half ass it thats what the last guy dideverything should be treated lumber no lumber should come into contact with dirt use deck blocks or solotubes with simpson strongtie standoff deck bases you wont need to buy simpson joist hangers on a really small deck the difference in using high cost materials and cheap materials is minimal maybe look at ipe decking or something like that i would steer clear of synthetics if you shop around you might find mahogany or ironwood decking for a couple bucks more than treated lumber but dont build the taj mahal in front of a manufactured home it just doesnt look right
DIY,not_removed,your biggest issue will be building steps rise and run youll have to make it fit maybe the hdlowes treated stringers will work maybe youll have to buy stair points and design your own
DIY,not_removed,it sounds like your deck is going to be pretty small but you can still follow this guide this also covers a basic rundown of the materials needed actually it would be a good idea to find out if you need a permit from your local governing body some places require permits for structures attached to a house some say only if its over a certain height
DIY,not_removed,ot as a general rule i hate watching videos on the internet but i make an exception for this old house i love their website and videos
DIY,not_removed,thank you so much this is what i needed a lot of what i found was for huge decks and i just needed some basic info i really appreciate it
DIY,not_removed,thanks for the link but yeah its more of a landing to be honest i check my citys code and i will not need a permit im gonna do a cad rendering of it all have my grandfather best carpenter ive ever met built most of my families furniture check it over then help me build it
DIY,not_removed,yeah it shouldnt be too complicated youll just need to make sure you have proper footings and attach a proper ledger board which by the way cant be attached over top of your siding the guide should help with those things
DIY,not_removed,thanks we actually have a ledger board on there its just covered up its newer too like years old

DIY,not_removed,i find this hilarious on diy plus they look amazing what does letting them sit in the tinfoil do is that just to keep them warm
DIY,not_removed,umm what
DIY,not_removed,ive never had any problems putting any drill bit it in any drill put any bit in and tighten the chuck
DIY,not_removed,do you mean the makita bits have flats on them for the chuck jaws to locate on other round drills without the flats will still work fine as long as the chuck is tightened sufficiently
DIY,not_removed,makita put grooves on the bit to match the notches on the inside of the chuck so other drill bits will not grip if i use them yeah i dont think that thats a thing if you have a three jaw chuck just about any bit that fits in the opening should work
DIY,not_removed,pics
DIY,not_removed,that doesnt sound right do the drill bits the drill takes look anything like if so you have an sds drill and not a regular chuck
DIY,not_removed,open the chuck all the way and look in there should be a screw head maybe allen or torx staring at you it might be reverse threaded remove it now the chuck needs unscrewed from the drill driveshaft it also may be reverse threaded i simply cannot remember grab the chuck with either channel lock pliers or a large vice grip now is the fun part you need to unscrew the chuck while holding the drill armature from spinning you can put a phillips screw driver in the side vent holds and keep the impeller blade from spinning you can also tap the trigger while holding the vice grips and switching from forward to reverse be careful good luck hope it helped

DIY,not_removed,if thats the case you can buy a jaw chuck which goes into an sds chuck
DIY,not_removed,makita doesnt make special drill bits but you can find hex ends which would work as well
DIY,not_removed,no they wont not if the chuck is tight enough source im a machinist
DIY,not_removed,ive been using it to shorten the legs of my coffee table how have you been using a drill to shorten table legs
DIY,not_removed,mate drill bits with the flats on normal straight shank drills are the exception not the norm the flats are more common on shit like spade bits and holesaws i drill holes through boiler plate regularly with a normal round bit and it aint a problem as long as the chuck is tight enough and there is a pilot hole
DIY,not_removed,is it an sds drill you dont want to use hammer mode with metal or wood bits
DIY,not_removed,consider the relative costbenefit analysis it would be trivial to ground the pipes as opposed to the issues that may be caused by an unlikely lightning strike
DIY,not_removed,the safest option of course is to bond ground the pipe in with your houses system this has nothing to do really with lightning this is about making sure that if there is a metal object or surface that could become electrified through a frayed wire or other mishap there will be a lowresistance path back to the service panel and the breaker will trip without bonding the pipes to ground if the wire did ever get damaged and somehow the pipes became electrified at you could get a lethal shock from touching it
DIY,not_removed,no need to ground the lighting cords as well as the circuit they are being powered by is grounded this is exactly why every appliance in your house does not need independently grounded that said as long as the pole is lower than the highest point in your houses rooftop you should not be over worried about lightening of any sort if it happens well sht happens fate good luck now go stick a pole somewhere itll do some good
DIY,not_removed,grounded or not grounded doesnt make much difference to lightning dont be near the pole in a lightning storm
DIY,not_removed,my thought was that i didnt want to invite the lightning to touch down on my deck but the more im reading about it the more it seems like lightning isnt attracted by small metal objects on houses lightning protection is simply there to protect stuff in case it is randomly hit by lightning
DIY,not_removed,im not too worried about the pipe being electrified by a frayed wire besides the amperage drawn by the light string is pretty minimal
DIY,not_removed,i guess i didnt think of the ramifications of the pole getting hit by lightning either way i dont want to be near it if it does and its not like the pole is hooked up to any expensive electronics aside from a string of lights
DIY,not_removed,fwiw i have a x allaluminum patio cover both posts and roof and in years that its been here i see no evidence that it was ever struck and we live in a lightningprone area we get a brief thunderstorm most afternoons from may through august
DIY,not_removed,its not the amperage the light string draws that matters its how much amperage the circuit ie the plug can provide that matters btw its enough to kill you
DIY,not_removed,thats proof enough for me thanks
DIY,not_removed,but if the light string is drawing amps you are only going to see amps right nothing else is on the circuit
DIY,not_removed,what he meant is if its connected to a or breaker thats is the current the circuit can potentially provide before tripping its like saying your car can only go because that is the furthest you have pushed the accelerator down but the car is capable of much more
DIY,not_removed,thats a non issue its a amp circuit
DIY,not_removed,is still plenty to kill a person just take the couple minutes to ground the thing and prevent the risk of danger
DIY,not_removed,if your looking for a simple way you could buy two shelving units from walmart ikea or any store and place then in your formation leaving a square hole at the cornermiddle connection point then have a custom cut piece of wood cut for you at any hardware store to go over the top to make it a seamless piece bonus hidden storage in the center hole if to top is placed on with a hinge cheap by much easier if its a first project
DIY,not_removed,i agree with using instead of ply as for the sturdiness of the shelves if you build that front edge like a skirt all the way around the shelf it will be fine especially if you get a few screws into the wall also if you raise the bottom shelf a few inches it will keep a lot of dust and dirt out of the case plus it looks a little more finished good luck
DIY,not_removed,would more than likely bow and i think you would have to have some kind of support in those center corners to keep it from sagging there personally i would use some x framing with a x front shelf support for the shelves to sit on and corner supports in the center which would give me a good strong unit that would hold whatever i put on it
DIY,not_removed,after looking at it again i agree ill go with the
DIY,not_removed,thanks for the input i thought about doing the framing too maybe ill draw it up in sketch up to give me an idea what it would look like i think if i go with and put a support at the corner it should be fine and add enough strength
DIY,not_removed,take into account that having a trim piece on the front edge of each shelf board also adds stiffening strength as would a cleat under the back edge nothing worse than sagging shelves so it is worth doing it right the first time good luck
DIY,not_removed,thanks for posting to rdiy unfortunately your post has been removed please read this entire message carefully before you reply and before you contact the moderators your post appears to be to the wrong subreddit your post may have been removed because its more of a craft project than a diy project posts about paper projects origami candles small decorative items etc should probably be posted in rcrafts its about paying someone to do a job in this case you might try rhomeimprovement if youre not sure where your post belongs try posting to rfindareddit read this httpswwwredditcomrfindaredditwikidirectory or search the httpswwwredditcomsubreddits to find an appropriate subreddit see the httpswwwredditcomrdiywikiguidelines for more information if you believe this is a mistake please thank you
DIY,not_removed,there is a trim ring around the base of the handle that is the inside not the side with the hole it sort of just clips on you can tell because of that little indent thing on it so if you slip a flat bladed screwdriver carefully under it you might want to put a piece of blue painters tape on the wood finish to protect it and then pry it up it will pop off and the screws are underneath it that hole is for unlocking it in an emergency you can stick a piece of stiff wire like a coat hangar in the hole to unlock it edit looks like that hole might be on the bathroom side of the door so maybe someone installed it backwards does it have a locking mechanism on the opposite side of the door from the hole edit this might help
DIY,not_removed,my guess theres a screw in that hole have you tried to shine a light into it or just try poking it with different screw drivers and see if you can get a grip on somehting
DIY,not_removed,in the first picture there is an indentation in the cover of the handle base use that to pry the cover away towards the handle under it should be a metal frame of sorts where the screws are hidden usually the cover is simply held on with pressure points so you can pry it off to get to the screws
DIY,not_removed,rlocksmith or rlockpicking can help also put a shoe or something next to the door frame to prevent it from closing
DIY,not_removed,maybe a pair of wide set channel locks on the cover plate with a good twist
DIY,not_removed,use a flat head screw driver and pop the front cover off the one you can see with the hole it it will be stuck on pretty good theres a o ring under it to hold it on and it does its job well it is the locking side so that hole is like you said the locking pin it just unscrews if it was there so you can remove the cover id recommend using something alittle thicker than the blue tape use a envelope or something remember pull hard and twist the screw driver it will be hard under the cover you will find screws probably philips head undo these pull handle out it shouldnt be hard but take the latch out also cos its a pain if the door closes with no handle if its broken then replace it dont piss around trying to repair its not expensive to replace hope this helps and good luck remember pull hard the cover sucks
DIY,not_removed,dont know if this has been answered already but there is usually a small alan key hole around the rim that once you loosen will allow you to pull the handle apart if you are unable to find it you may have to pull the cover off with a little force it should be relatively easy to find and unscrew as long as you know what you are looking for
DIY,not_removed,ah that did it id tried prying it before but it didnt feel like it would come off and i was afraid that i might do some damage but when i tried again it was just as you said thanks i dont think i can fix the handle after all that but at least now i know whats wrong haha you were correct that the hole should have a locking mechanism in it but for some reason this particular handle didnt one of the previous tenants must have broken it along with the rest of the handle
DIY,not_removed,yep just what i was going to say if theres no screws visible it must just snap on unless theres a tiny screw on the very bottom that youre not seeing
DIY,not_removed,ah usually that hole is where you place the locking mechanism so you can lock the door but for some reason its missing here i thought the same thing as you at first but the hole just goes right through to the other side
DIY,not_removed,theres actually two indentations i tried to use them to pry the cover away as you suggested but the indentations are pretty shallow and its nearly impossible to get any kind of grip with them im not sure what purpose they serve but it doesnt seem like they are used for that purpose at least
DIY,not_removed,im kind of ashamed to admit that i didnt even think of putting something to block the door i immediately went and shoved something in there as soon as i read your comment haha and thanks for the subreddit suggestions ill give them a try if i cant find a solution anytime soon
DIY,not_removed,ah i eventually got it off it was just a question of prying with a little more force than i expected thanks though
DIY,not_removed,glad it worked i dont know where you live but here in florida a new handle is cheap less than easier just to replace the entire thing
DIY,not_removed,ah yes good point sometimes there is tiny set screw on the very bottom of the trim ring that needs a hex key or a tiny screwdriver to remove but this looks like a stamped trim ring which is very thin usually those are on heavy cast trim rings on the thin ones there is nothing for the threads of the tiny screw to grab onto so my guess is it probably just pops off
DIY,not_removed,hmmm most of my other ideas have been suggested already have you tried just pulling on the handles themselves ive seen a type that was only held in place by being inserted into eachother with friction
DIY,not_removed,probably had a thumb latch at one point to lock the handle but it has fallen off
DIY,not_removed,try to get a flat screwdriver or something under the lip of the cover instead the indentations may just be the pressure points themselves and not designed for prying
DIY,not_removed,yeah i eventually worked out that this was actually the solution haha
DIY,not_removed,am i the only one who just writes the color name on the wall below it im painting over it within a short time anyway

DIY,not_removed,what is your guys experience with flex lines through a cabinet id check local building code csst was banned in my home town for a couple of years early generations of csst are still banned but they are allowing csst that meets to be installed now thats a roundabout way of saying always check with local building codes when messing with gas
DIY,not_removed,the runner in the back that goes between the two sets of legs if you make it or tall you can use it to hide cables and to mount power strips etc the extra height will also give you more support in the center
DIY,not_removed,use for the legs cheap way more meat than plywood legs there is make magazine toolbench i would adapt cost me it has lasted years plus
DIY,not_removed,just throwing this out i built a desk about years ago that i still use daily using a hollow core door for the top instead of plywood i think its less likely to warp and the finish feels nice though less attractive
DIY,not_removed,i think you will have sag on the frontend of the desk with this long of a span when its only supported with an apron in the back a solidwood front edging strip could help but i second the idea to use a hollowcore door essentially youre benefiting from a torsionbox design without having to put the effort in to make it they can also be cut to width and plugged with inserts and theyd be a good fit for the size of your work surface if youre interested in computing sag check out the sagulator httpwwwwoodbincomcalcssagulator they have an option for plywood you can input load ratings and it will calculate the amount of sag
DIY,not_removed,in addition to the top sagging the legs will be wobbly if you used a double thickness of plywood it would keep the general look but it would be a lot sturdier you also should have an apron running under the front of the desk if you use a double thickness of ply on the top that might be enough to take care of that also
DIY,not_removed,i think youll be just fine with plywood legs for a point of reference see ron paulks knockdown work tables his paulk total station rests on folding saw legs made out of inch plywood ive built them and they are surprisingly rock solid way beyond what you need for a desk my greatest concern would be a method of joinery tying the legs to the top youll need to consider something to resist racking forces any lateral forces might shear the joint between the legs and top with enough load on top an apron could help in more ways than one unifying the vertical plane of the structure against horizontal racking while stiffening the horizontal plane of the top against vertical deflection but if you really want to keep the lighter profile perhaps plywood gussets at the legs could stiffen the connections to the top
DIY,not_removed,see
DIY,not_removed,do you have any pictures of it
DIY,not_removed,if you cant get access to an air compressor like ujohnsnowflake said i would recommend holding the case so that the side is facing the floor and shake the hell out of it then get one of those really soft paintbrushes or a neodymium magnet wrapped in paper and go through and sweep over the whole thing it doesnt really matter much if you miss a few shavings down at the bottom of the case but be sure to get everything from the top if something falls on your board or the back of your gpus it will probably short and fry everything it touches good luck nbsp edit words missing
DIY,not_removed,use a vacuum cleaner with the detail wand
DIY,not_removed,find a friend or family member with an air compressor spend some time with the blowgun in an open space where the shavings can fly out ps dont spend a lot of time blowing on the fans with the blowgun they will come apart and fan blades can cut at speed
DIY,not_removed,uraidenraptor do not put a magnet in your pc case especially anywhere near a hard drive
DIY,not_removed,thanks mate
DIY,not_removed,this would do the trick just be thorough
DIY,not_removed,thanks mate
DIY,not_removed,is there a problem holding the fans in place before you blow thats what ive always done but if im damaging them in some way i should stop
DIY,not_removed,no problem
DIY,not_removed,nah holding them in place is fine what happens with shooting the fans with compressed air is they spin way faster than they were designed to and the centrifugal forces can blow them apart also if you get your finger near those spinning blades at that speed they will slice through it like a ginsu knife
DIY,not_removed,ah if that is indeed the case no pun intended then ofc thats fine sorry if i misunderstood
DIY,not_removed,i learned this with my old btc mining rig remember when gpu mining was profitable gpu fan under its own power sliced right through my hand the gpu is sitting somewhere still waiting to be recycled and it still has blood on it
DIY,not_removed,it can also act as a generator when spinning and fry other parts
DIY,not_removed,you would also need an insanely powerful magnet to damage or wipe a modern hard drive one of those gigantic neodymium magnets that cost might do the trick
DIY,not_removed,it sounds like they are using the switch as a connector to another branch usually the hots would be tied together with a pig tail going to the switch then the other from the switch to the fixture
DIY,not_removed,cant really advise you without pictures of what youre talking about
DIY,not_removed,without any pictures id say replicate and replace but cant say for sure
DIY,not_removed,the terminal with wires is your power the terminal with just is your switch leg you have power coming in to the box and then power going out to something else another switch or a plug you attach both power wires together so you have power at the switch as well as at the next device this isnt strange and it isnt somebody piggybacking power this is how your entire house is wired ideally you would splice the two wires together with a third wire and have the one wire wrapped around the screw backstabbing is a shitty thing to do
DIY,not_removed,just take a pic and post it its not rocket surgery
DIY,not_removed,it sounds like a single pole switch which should have one hot wire on each terminal and two neutral wires wire nutted together i dont know where the other wire would be coming from is there a neutral wire in the box it could be going to another light or even a switched receptacle
DIY,not_removed,in the majority case of faulty switches and receptacles ive replaced over the years the diyer used the back stabbing option instead of properly terminating clockwise around the screw dont use shortcuts they can cause loose connections arcing and are a fire hazard
DIY,not_removed,that makes sense maybe there was no more room in the box or they were lazy all these switches and outlets are backstabbed whoever put them in was definitely lazy
DIY,not_removed,i mean imagine the back of a light switch its got a nut on the top left and the bottom left and the nuts also have backstab options theres a wire in both backstabs and a wire on one of the nuts im not sure a photo would illustrate it any better
DIY,not_removed,thanks im not sure either can you piggyback off a light switch a lot of the outlets are piggybacked but thats normal i dont know what it would be connected to
DIY,not_removed,yeah the people who wired this backstabbed everything ive been redoing it so this isnt unusual its just even lazier work
DIY,not_removed,thats the leading theory that its another hot wire piggybacking im guessing i just copy this onto the new switch and everything should work
DIY,not_removed,i have two questions is it okay for the wire to be touching the sides or should it be very tightly around the screw should it be so tight around the screw that makes it difficult to get off
DIY,not_removed,im aware of two types of nuts one threads onto a bolt one encloses a wire splice neither of those scenarios is applicable to a light switch switches usually have screws i suspect you mean screws but i have no idea how familiar you are with doing electrical work and since electricity can kill you id rather see what youre talking about than blindly assume things when giving advice
DIY,not_removed,you can i wouldnt say its typical but yes it can be done
DIY,not_removed,fuck it not like its gonna kill anyone am i right make sure the breaker is off if you dont know which breaker it is just touch a hot wire to a neutral wire to create a dead short which will trip the breaker if you die im not liable youre probably safe though
DIY,not_removed,the wire should be made into a hook that makes even contact where copper touches the screw furthermore the wire should come directly off the back of the device with copper only under the terminals no insulation should be under the screw if you back the screw out further it will easier to hook the wire on
DIY,not_removed,well ive fixed all the ones ive redone except for two the one that wasnt pigtailed and one that had no space in the box ive learned a lot about wiring ive learned that a lot of the instructions on switches are wrong and that there way switches arent built the same way and ive learned how to fix them swap the traveling wires
DIY,not_removed,yes theyre screws my bad i dont know what a photo would tell you that this description wont the point is theres three wires connected where i am used to there just being two
DIY,not_removed,you nonelectricians need to stop trying to give electrical advice
DIY,not_removed,i mean what else could this be i assume since its a light switch it doesnt matter what connects to what i dont like backstabbing so i could connect the other to a screw but one of them is gonna have to be backstabbed
DIY,not_removed,or i mean i use my tester on all the wires
DIY,not_removed,yeah i got all that but thats not what i asked is it okay if the wire is touching the sides of the box it makes contact with the screw but the tip of it is not curved around it and is close to hitting the box for example and should it be tight around the screw like encircling it at the end because that seems like itd become very difficult to take off but a fish hook can be loose or can be touching the edges of the box and i dont know if thats okay
DIY,not_removed,to the front page with you cannot upvote enough
DIY,not_removed,sorry but your tester wont break the circuit in all seriousness id just copy the old switch and you should be fine
DIY,not_removed,im having a bit of difficulty trying to picture what you mean however if an insulated wire is touching the box and there are to nicks or abrasions on it you should be fine
DIY,not_removed,i meant id just test the wires and see if theyre hot before getting my greasy hands all over them and yeah i knew this would be the answer it was just unexpected thank you
DIY,not_removed,use scraps of wood milk paint way more ecofriendly and less time consuming vs making moldsalso silicone and plastic resin are crazy expensive wood is easy enough anyone can whittle it into shape you can use simple hand tools drill it for velcro connections the benefits keep going on for actual casting of kids toys i dunno what your preferences are but ive used smooth on casting products in the past and they make tons of options ive used the smoothcast a few times it would likely work quite well my concern is the paints youll be using on the finished product can it go in a kids mouth also check and see if you have any stores selling used kids clothes and toys around us theres a place called once upon a child ive scored some nice toys there stuff like worth of tinker toys for

DIY,not_removed,thank you for the suggestions i am not sure the route i will end up taking wood does seem like the easiest options but i was hoping for something a little more realistic i will look into smoothcast thank you again
DIY,not_removed,well originally i was hoping for something more realisticbut those might be perfect thank you
DIY,not_removed,just google momentary computer switch theres a few popular sites that sell the components the hard part is getting your cut outs lined up because not everyone gives out dimensions

DIY,not_removed,solder epoxy
DIY,not_removed,gorilla glue makes a two part mixing epoxy in a little pair of testtube like applicator pretty strong stuff and would probably do the trick dries clear so you can clean up the join after its set and it wont be noticeable
DIY,not_removed,httpwwwinstructablescomidcopperroseallsteps
DIY,not_removed,solder with an iron instead of a torch much easier than epoxy if you dont like the idea of handling a degree f iron get a transformer type soldering gun they heat very quickly and cool off fast too copper does not discolor unless it is overheated your design is going to tarnish soon anyway isnt it
DIY,not_removed,solder is the reliable method tarnish after soldering can be removed with brasso
DIY,not_removed,bs yes its a specific question smdh

DIY,not_removed,solder would work but i hate to use a torch on the thin copper flowers unsure if ga would melt easily or not also wouldnt that turn the copper a darker ugly color dunno if epoxy will bond to copper
DIY,not_removed,no access to welde and im using copper as stem
DIY,not_removed,you can build it and then just let your wife stand out there and hold it up
DIY,not_removed,so the translation here is you want to shut your wife up by building a plant screen that can neither be anchored to the wall nor secured into the earth sounds like a nasa job to me i have only been at this for years and shes got me stumped do it this way ask her how it needs done then come back here for our reviews on that k
DIY,not_removed,dig the posts deeper and set your concrete under ground level if you ever want to move em just cut the posts off under ground level and bury evedence alternatively throw acid in your wifes eyes while shes asleep and just lie that its built to her spec personally i think blinding your wife is the easiest option
DIY,not_removed,i can help you build that very straight forward but making a woman happy is beyond mans ability to do
DIY,not_removed,place the post in a gal bucket full of cement then place the buckets in the ground tired of it just dig it up and move it
DIY,not_removed,why dont you just build it like a bench but instead of seating make it a planter weight of dirt should prevent it from tipping over
DIY,not_removed,instead of using concrete pour some pea gravel around the post and tamp it down i promise you it will be just as solid feeling as concrete ive done this many times for fence posts then if you ever decide to get rid of it then you should be able to get a good grip on it and pull it out after some aggressive post wiggling
DIY,not_removed,i have done the same in front of my garbage bins by my garage i dug a hole about three feet deep generally about of the above ground height is recommended i believe used pressure treated wood get wood plumb and dump in concrete mix then dump in water you can also use those cylinder tubes as well hopefully you dont have any roots like i did see if you need to check for utility lines when the posts are set slap on your horizontal pieces also you can set the posts in one of those cheap home depot homer buckets and then put the bucket in the ground edit stain it before you put it together
DIY,not_removed,its not that hard to pull out posts in concrete if you want to take it out later a chain and a high lift jack will take them out easy enough i would be pretty wary of not doing posts in concrete one windy day could cause you a lot of problems
DIY,not_removed,you can use steel post anchorsholders usually come in dimensions of inches that you hammer into the ground and fasten the wooden posts to it
DIY,not_removed,why couldnt you just build a bed like structure then nail the wall into it
DIY,not_removed,as a woman this made me laugh louder than i should no emily both hands
DIY,not_removed,happy wife happy life lol shes talking about building some kind of base let me ask this how hard would it be to remove this screen thing later on if i set the posts in the ground any other ways to set it without using concrete
DIY,not_removed,op do this sink the concrete not the acid thing seriously you could dig a hole just dont fill it to the top with concrete you can drill hammer rebar thru your legs for extra strength
DIY,not_removed,this a well thought out solution acid is a solution i laughed out loud with this comment pretty good idea burying the concrete though
DIY,not_removed,this or just use dirt around the post and tamp it down no need for concrete especially for a short length like the photos if youre concerned about it tilting you can always use a key against the bottom of the post then when you dont want it dig it up and remove
DIY,not_removed,i agree with you shes building it now bc i dont want to fight shes pretty stubborn
DIY,not_removed,she finally explained that she may want to move it one day either further up to the side further back or to the backyard etc shes on her own in this my job is to landscape so thats what ill be doing thanks for all of the suggestionsi think ill be needing them later lol
DIY,not_removed,at autoparts stores they have spray paint made for plastics mask off everything and spraypaint the red parts to green i dont think youll be able to disassemble and reassemble the chair to actually change the fabric as a side note do they make it in green why not just sell this one and buy one in green i think that is a safer bet than trying to change the color on this one and potentially making it unusable

DIY,not_removed,i am probably going to just paint the red things like you said i might try and change the red by finding an extremely thin piece of fabric to sew on theres not that much to do really and the green chairs are not the same as mine i want a fabric chair so it doesnt get really hot or cold whereas i can only find leather ones
DIY,not_removed,another option would be to find some green fabric cut it to the exact size of the red fabric find a way to keep the edges from unraveling then glue it over the top of the red fabric however cutting it to the exact size would be very difficult and finding a way to keep the edges from unraveling would be very difficult also but if you can find a way to do that then you could mask off the areas that arent red then put contact cement on the red fabric and apply the green fabric over it if you dont have a way to conceal the edges it probably wouldnt look that good after a few months the edges might begin to peel up
DIY,not_removed,yeah thats what i was thinking but im not sure
DIY,not_removed,one neutral will work just fine for getting to the panel i would cut a hole drop greenfield to the panel then put the other end of the greenfield into the back of a junction box mount it over the hole then pipe out of the side of the box no idea what panel your working with since i dont do residential work
DIY,not_removed,although you dont have a single main breaker you should have a series of breakers that function as main breakers for the lower end of the panel if you cannot locate them you would need the provider to cut power if you plan on doing some safe work i would think you only need one neutral run for the circuit going back to the panel gfci receptacles provide ground protection at that receptacle and down the stream the gfci breaker would take the role of the receptacles and having both wouldmight be redundant as long as the rest of the outlets are on the load side of the initial gfci you are ground fault protected for a garage i dont know if having multiple gfcis branches is going to benefit anything because if you overload the circuit it will trip at the breaker if you are at that point then you might need separate circuits to meet the demand but i doubt that is the case
DIY,not_removed,the wood grain of a shingle runs with the roofs slope even if it cups water will still flow downward cupping in a shingle is minimized by the overlapping row holding the shingle below flat a plank would likely cup a bit and even minimal amounts of pooled water will deteriorate the wood planks would also need to be quite wide to allow reasonable exposure and still permit sufficient lap the wider the plank the more likely it is that it will contain defects that could allow leakage
DIY,not_removed,i have a small cabin in the woods in the midwest we went with a metal roof like this we are very happy with it
DIY,not_removed,i think what you want are shakes
DIY,not_removed,the biggest reason it wont last as long requiring frequent replacement
DIY,not_removed,because it doesnt work as well as shingles
DIY,not_removed,weight might be a problem as well
DIY,not_removed,use sheet metal roofing
DIY,not_removed,malarkey shingles only require a or higher so pitch really isnt much of a concern it does require full icewater shield or a double layer of synthetic underlayment due to the lower slopes if it was a flatter roof id put metal on it for longevity sake
DIY,not_removed,how much did that roof cost
DIY,not_removed,could you explain why it seems like it should work just as well
DIY,not_removed,because its too big too flat and doesnt overlap enough youll end up with standing water
DIY,not_removed,youd need a steeply pitched roof else during a storm water could be driven under the shingles
DIY,not_removed,you should just be able to wedge a screwdriver under the nut and lift as you turn im having a hard time understanding why the nut wont come off if its turning if it can turn with just fingers just pull on it as you turn it what am i missing
DIY,not_removed,as your unscrewing pull in the direction that your unscrewing if you can replace both bolt and screw cut it off with a metabo or a file if its small sounds like you crosstheaded the nut and stipped it
DIY,not_removed,i cant turn it with my fingers but it is close to coming off my last resort is going to get the dremel and cutting it off but i really dont want to do that
DIY,not_removed,nutsplitter angle grinder hacksaw dremel maybe boltcutters cut it off and replace boltsnnuts are cheap

DIY,not_removed,buy a nutsplitter
DIY,not_removed,nut splitter
DIY,not_removed,i really dont want to do that why not the nut is useless
DIY,not_removed,if youre not careful you could also damage the bolt threads
DIY,not_removed,how much current do you want to send through it ie how much current will the circuits of the boombox draw and how much current will the charger deliver
DIY,not_removed,the boom box has to be able to be powered from outside with leftover laptop charger brick or from battery pack the balancing controller has b b for the batteries in series the in between connections of the series go to the special balancing contacts and then the p p are for output to the board i want to power but everywhere i look i can never find where to connect the input to charge the battery pack
DIY,not_removed,the battery pack delivers

DIY,not_removed,when you say the battery pack delivers that is simply multiplied by the batteries not sure if you added the mah rating in the same way but a couple of points to consider fully charged those batteries series would be capable of each so more like all kind of besides the point as in order to know the gauge of wire needed you need to know how much current will be traveling through them the bigger the current the bigger the wire this would be determined by measuring the draw on said batteries under load you might have a better chance posting in diy tech
DIY,not_removed,how does the patch job in front of the door look now that the floor is refinished
DIY,not_removed,itt op needs to move his tv
DIY,not_removed,not a fan of a tv over a mantlebut other than that nice work
DIY,not_removed,the tv would be better off on the right of the room at eye level where it should be above the fireplace is way too high up
DIY,not_removed,wow the wood flooring really goes well with the fireplace good job op
DIY,not_removed,the rule for me if the tv is placed up that high it needs to be a jumbo screen nice work though
DIY,not_removed,can you put the tv across from the sofa over the fireplace looks awful
DIY,not_removed,move the books on the top left down to the bottom right put receiver and console on the top left and move the tv to the center
DIY,not_removed,op that fireplace mantle you removed was load bearing and that wood flooring is actually asbestos your entire house is going to collapse and you now have cancer next time hire an engineer
DIY,not_removed,you said the house was built in im wondering if it had built ins next to the fireplace originally a lot of the home around here from the same era have the same window set up near the fireplace and they all have original built ins
DIY,not_removed,looks great can you explain again how you replaced the floor boards with tongue and groove especially the longer ones how did you get them in without damaging the tonguegroove thanks
DIY,not_removed,wall mount the tv and when possible sell that couch and get a more mature one that couch just seems like a bachelor couch in a room that deserves an chesterfield it would also match the lounge chair better
DIY,not_removed,the fireplace looks great the room needs some interior design help though update furniture mount tv clear out the clutter on the shelves
DIY,not_removed,mate great job im loving your work
DIY,not_removed,how much wall space is on the right looks like a much better place for a tv
DIY,not_removed,crown molding is not actually complicated at all if youre only doing degree corners set your mitre to degrees set your bevel to degrees cut the molding flat thats it theres a good chance your saw has those angles marked
DIY,not_removed,your decorating could use some improvement but the construction work is great looks good
DIY,not_removed,read that wonderbar as wonderbra jeez
DIY,not_removed,i honestly found the before room much clean and pretty than after
DIY,not_removed,time for a new couch that thing looks terrible lol sorry
DIY,not_removed,this inspires me
DIY,not_removed,i think it looks much better too nice job
DIY,not_removed,isnt it fun cutting upside down and backwards for crown good job though man not many take the timeeffort to trim things out right these days
DIY,not_removed,fantastic i really appreciate the writeup and pictorial of the process would view again keep up the good work and i hope you enjoy the new space
DIY,not_removed,anyone have advice or resourses that you can recommend for rehabing hardwood floors i am starting a remodel and i want to refinish the floors but there are some areas that i think will need some tlc there are some really creaky and worn areas in the interior doorways i am eventually planning to replace the flooring in the bedrooms and the living room and remodel the kitchendining area and put down tile but i am in sort of a transitional period at work starting up some new offices and i just dont have the time right now in a couple of years things will be better i just need to pull out the carpet and make the hardwood passable we have dogs and cats and the carpet will just be disgusting if we dont get it pulled out soon
DIY,not_removed,really nice job with the floor repair thanks for sharing
DIY,not_removed,we need closer pictures of those dogs oh yeah nice job on the living room
DIY,not_removed,posting finished results first buy this man gold
DIY,not_removed,neither of the two dogs in the first photo match the dog in the thirdfromlast photo i call shenanigans
DIY,not_removed,nice im about to start a project like this tell me about the fireplace heat did you look into it with regard to mantel fire proofing anything like that
DIY,not_removed,love the crown moulding and the new floor boards how long did this all take you
DIY,not_removed,i liked it better before
DIY,not_removed,i think you are living in the house i just bought
DIY,not_removed,lookin good also i love the idea of the dog going under the house with you just because i can imagine my lab doing the same thing he be crawling all over then get a massive case of the zoomies when we got back outside
DIY,not_removed,i moved into a house that is full wired coax and speaker wire to intercoms and speakers in every room they all terminate in a custom made cubby hole that only fits a tv with thin bezel above the fire place someone spent a lot of money or did a lot of work doing what ive just begun painstakingly undoing
DIY,not_removed,not to mention the couch is perpendicular it all looks good but damn upon closer inspection its gotta be uncomfortable
DIY,not_removed,yes get that tv down on a console or other low piece of furniture on an adjacentopposite wall
DIY,not_removed,the shade is a bit lighter than the older floors modern red oak and year old red oak look a bit different but being right next to the door and there being a couch there you cant really tell unless youre looking for it i think over time the sun from the front door will fade the new stuff to look a bit more like the old stuff im not super happy with the result and i probably could have stained the new part to sort of match the existing but i dont have the patience to do that sort of thing
DIY,not_removed,yeah i want to see it too
DIY,not_removed,wall mount and center the tv over the fireplace it will make the room so much better
DIY,not_removed,for real
DIY,not_removed,theres nowhere else in the house to put it im in the same boat but the space is small and thats the only spot that makes sense
DIY,not_removed,were gonna get a new tv one of these days
DIY,not_removed,no space it opens into the kitchen right there and the wall next to that is small and goes into the bedroom
DIY,not_removed,it looks quite disorderly along with the drab couches i thought the first picture was the before picture you did some amazing work with the flooring and the mantle but all the stuff you put on there is distracting id put some of that stuff in a nice looking chest you could also use as a coffee table also that tv is not doing your mantle any favours id put on a stand or hang it on the wall where the doorway is above your mantle id put an antique looking mirror ill make the room appear bigger and draw the attention to your mantle a nice warm bluegrey for the walls would go great with the floor edit thought i was posting this as a comment for the op whoops
DIY,not_removed,the receiver is too deep for the built ins it hangs over like inches once theres wires connected to it trust me thats not where i want it i might have to build a little shelf topper to put the receiver on one of the built ins
DIY,not_removed,exactly this
DIY,not_removed,yeah so you put two dots on each end of each piece of flooring and connect them so you end up with two long lines going down the middle of each board youre removing you take your circular saw set the depth a smidgin below the floor and rip along those lines that gives you a middle piece you can remove then you can take the groove side out of the opposing tongue then you can pry the last piece with the tongue and nails out on the ends of the boards where youre stopping it you use the oscillating multitool to cut it off square then you measure and cut your new pieces to fit and you start laying them like you would normal flooring if the space is really tight and you cant slide it into place youll have to rip the bottom little piece of the groove side so that you can put the tongue in first then whack the other side into place over the other tongue and the last piece loses the same piece of groove so it falls into place put down a little construction adhesive since you arent nailing that one and youre good to go
DIY,not_removed,they cut parts to fit and cut off the tongues then nailed them all down
DIY,not_removed,its all the clutter that was added
DIY,not_removed,dogs cant have nice things
DIY,not_removed,we cant burn anything in it yet the chimney needs to be lined that being said the general code is from the opening
DIY,not_removed,all in all we finished it over about months worth of weekends
DIY,not_removed,thats probably because ops furniture does not fit together at all guess op found his next project
DIY,not_removed,yeah i need to figure out how to center it and keep the receiver up there its not ideal
DIY,not_removed,put a large art there with a hinge so you can get to your stuff
DIY,not_removed,i own a year old bungalow that two people were murdered in during the the incident happened upstairs and when i bought the home there was carpet covering the floors up there naturally curious i ripped up the carpet and found two giant dark spots in the floor sanded it down again and again stains still very visible i had to stain that bitch so dark its almost black and you can still see it
DIY,not_removed,i refinish old hardwood floors yes the best idea would have been sanding down to extra raw wood doing a good fine sanding and then staining it all with a mid to dark stain it would have blended decently and had that old patina you were looking for as some of those big dark stains i saw are just not going to come out overall looks great for obviously doing the quick and dirty version however i cant see it up close what grit did you finish on and i assume you just used minwax floor poly or something
DIY,not_removed,nah man thats so played out and looks tacky as hell
DIY,not_removed,wall mounts make everything better
DIY,not_removed,stillnice work
DIY,not_removed,i did a mantelmount its kinda doofy but i have to respect how much i prefer it over craning my neck
DIY,not_removed,an option is tv and minimalist console in front of window with sofa in front of kitchen doorway not blocking but facing put a nice sofa back table there then you wont get direct light glare
DIY,not_removed,the chair is my grandpas and the couch we bought about years ago when we had a much larger space for it its done well with the dogs weve fostered at once and our current we want a smaller sectional that fits the space and is a bit less oversized but thats not in the budget quite yet well get there and then well ruin it because dogs
DIY,not_removed,thats probably it
DIY,not_removed,ill take one art please
DIY,not_removed,i ran it from up to minwax satin poly only over that coats
DIY,not_removed,so having it sitting awkwardly on top of the fireplace and off center is better
DIY,not_removed,the space is too small to be arranged too differently well eventually get a smaller couch to fit the space and it will more than likely go directly in front of the fireplace with the chair near the window but the space is just really awkward for a tv and theres not really anwhere else to put it in the house
DIY,not_removed,im sorry madam but we are all out of arts however we do have a large selection of garfunkels
DIY,not_removed,shrugs
DIY,not_removed,bort
DIY,not_removed,peel up grind to a fine powder and cast into the fan of your forced air system
DIY,not_removed,you dont want to be dealing with asbestos it will become airborne while removing the tiles you really should have a professional in take care of that they will need to seal off the area to prevent the particles from spreading to other parts of the house i like to save money on renos and do as much work as i can myself but i would gladly pay for the asbestos remediation and yes im willing to bet the wood paneling needs to be removed as well i wouldnt risk it
DIY,not_removed,super dusty job and quite dangerous im a carpenter you need to grind the concrete id hire a company
DIY,not_removed,floorcovering pro here youve been given mostly good advice so far that is definitely cutback and those tiles and adhesive definitely do have asbestos in them and as the homeowner in many locations in the us removal regulations do allow you to remove it yourself keeping dust down is as was already stated an important factor for you to consider wetting things down helps but its not foolproof anywhere dust can settle it can be stirred back up it the future having said all that a few more things to mention that type of glue isnt really affected all that much by water whats happened to the glue is it has naturally aged and undergone a process called crystallizing whereby it becomes naturally dried out and brittle it might be like that under the entire floor or it might not for any adhesive that is still holding tile down tight application of heat to the surface of the tile for a short period of time will cause the adhesive beneath to release the tile will get really soft during heating and can be scraped up with a putty knife as opposed to being popped up when cold the adhesive once heated up will reactivate and become a little messy though ardex feather finish is an awesome product but its used more for vinyl underlayment asjoint compound that skimcoat where im from for skimcoat here we use products with latex milk mix additive which is a strong binder but also seals the floor and prevents old potentially still active adhesive from bleeding up into whatever you lay on top of it
DIY,not_removed,ive read that if tiles are they will have asbestos in them
DIY,not_removed,i agree with garpt if you have asbestos concerns call in a professional i have run into several jobs like this and you really cant easily beat the equipment hepa filtration machines respirators and knowledge a professional company has asbestos is not something you want to mess with inside your home handled wrongly its a killer i used to work near libby montana where they made asbestos hundreds if not thousands of people there now have severe health concerns due to the microscopic fiber emissions good luck with your project let us know how it works out
DIY,not_removed,jokes on you no forced air here
DIY,not_removed,ive seen people on this subreddit saying they ripped up the old tile wearing a respirator and skimcoated over it also lots of other sources on the internet i was just looking for other possible methods im not worried about the asbestos if i seal off the basement and wear the right gear
DIY,not_removed,why does the concrete need to be ground why not use bean e doo or sentinel mastic remover
DIY,not_removed,this pretty well sums it up vat has a very low amount of asbestos in it and its not friable so youd have to actually grind it up and throw it into that fan to make it all that dangerous wetting the area is still a good idea of course there are machine you can rent that will slice this right off the floor with a large razor blade and minimal dust taking most of the adhesive with it we use mapei plani patch with plani patch plus for skimming stuff like this
DIY,not_removed,thanks i dont really have any experience with stuff like this just plumbing and electrical ill look into the armstrong floor finish is that latex meant to be applied directly to the floor or mixed with their concrete skimcoating
DIY,not_removed,health concerns arise after long term exposureas with a lot of things in life a project like this poses minimal risks keep the dust down wear a mask respirator if you want to be extra careful and throw your clothes in the wash after you finish the tiles and mastic are not friable why pay thousands for a job you can do yourself
DIY,not_removed,i work for an environmental engineeringconstruction company you could do this a tyvek onesie with a respirator wouldnt hurt and wouldnt be too expensive if there is enough standing moisture that there wouldnt be much dust generation you could scrape the adhesive yourself again dust generation is your key concern here if grinding is required you should go with an abatement company definitely spot check your wood paneling for the mildew concerns youre right in that it wouldnt absorb moisture like sheetrock your safest bet would be a remediation company but if you really cant afford it just cover your bases for airborne generation and removal safety
DIY,not_removed,more info on this machine i can rent the entire basement is covered in this stuff and its probably over sq ft
DIY,not_removed,thanks not much standing moisture in the basement theres a dehumidifier running full time down there the mold and mildew is from when the basement flooded a while back and wasnt properly dried out at the time there was also some mildew buildup on all surfaces from when the dehumidifier kicked off and i didnt realize it but thats all been cleaned up with a bleach spray solution
DIY,not_removed,something like which a lot of home depots rent there are probably similar machines available at various rental places
DIY,not_removed,excellent and not available at my home depot
DIY,not_removed,the perspective on image tripped me out so hard
DIY,not_removed,how does it work when i googled drift wagon i only got cars do two people use it
DIY,not_removed,would there not be fumes from the engine blowing back into the wagon
DIY,not_removed,i hate to say it but i would have loved to seen it kept the original radio flyer paint with just a clear coat old school ones like these are hard to find
DIY,not_removed,youre welcome
DIY,not_removed,well a person sits in the back and you go down the hill although this one was only built to pull my son in a parade coming up its mostly a show thing for this build im going to make another and run the axle through the inside of the wagon to lower it a bit it will be stronger to accommodate an adult rider
DIY,not_removed,as much as a lawn mower its the reason i made the hitch so long one of the pictures shows it after i extended it
DIY,not_removed,i feel you i have a few of them i am planning on repainting one to original etc also have one that i will keep the way it and file that under patina i just wanted this one to match the trike but i do love the radio flyer red its so iconic
DIY,not_removed,what size engine is that and did u also make bike
DIY,not_removed,its a harbor freight predator cc motor the trike is a flatout drift trike you can find them at wwwflatoutdrifttrikescom
DIY,not_removed,you can use a terminal block with one of there are many other options you can just loop a piece of wire along the terminals of any terminal block
DIY,not_removed,there is no such critter but due to the nature of what terminal blocks get used for theres products out there that will create one for you you can use wire jumpers to connect one side of the terminal blocks together or you can source out a compatible terminal block jumper strip to do the same easier
DIY,not_removed,not going to say to do this but one could use din rail mounted ground modular terminal blocks the ground terminal blocks are interconnected and power will transfer to every terminal these are intended for ground connections but for that low power level they would work but arent made for it they are cheap on ebay
DIY,not_removed,oh i know i can just cant find a terminal block large enough
DIY,not_removed,noone ever would want to distribute power to multiple sources over a bus i think im maybe not using the right words i just want to distribute over a buncha different wires whatever lets me do that outside of twisting the wires together im good with
DIY,not_removed,there we go thatll do it theyre rated up to amps so that should cover all my applications far and away
DIY,not_removed,just use two of
DIY,not_removed,buy a stripboard and solder your own
DIY,not_removed,damn clickbaitish title nice clock though clever
DIY,not_removed,the project took about hours if you do not include the code or the letting the epoxy harden this is a great project if you want an introduction to addressable leds let me know if you have any questions
DIY,not_removed,sorry i was trying to do a punny title because you have to mix two part epoxy not my best
DIY,not_removed,i work with epoxy at work sometimes to glue up furniture what are your thoughts on working with the amounts you used safely did you wear a mask or work in a room with adequate ventilation
DIY,not_removed,
DIY,not_removed,room was wellventilated and we stored the clock outside while it was hardening i have worked with a lot of different types of epoxy famowood the epoxy we used does not have the caustic property that i have observed a lot of other epoxies to have when they are curing i suspect this is because the famowood epoxy is meant only to act as a glaze and undergoes less cross linking as compared to epoxies meant for more structural applications thanks for your question
DIY,not_removed,thanks for the response
DIY,not_removed,did you do anything to prep the surfaces before priming good results from painting requires good prep
DIY,not_removed,you probably bought and used a flat finish paint and yes all it does is soak up dirt personally i cant see the value in ever using the stuff look at a semi gloss matte or high gloss finish next time but actually look at it before buying
DIY,not_removed,i have recently used ben moore advance paint in some trim i painted over it was finished and i deglossed it and primed it with bin primer and put a thin coat of that on top in white and buffed it with steel wool then put another thin coat on and it looks amazing its a great paint that is kind of a combo of oil and water based paints i is hard like oil based and takes hours between coats but damn it is smooth and looks sharp i plan to do the rest of the house and my bathroom cabinets with this downside is price though like per gallon
DIY,not_removed,behr ultra makes a latex acrylic in semi gloss one quart does quite a lot if you have primed get ultra pure white color at the home depot

DIY,not_removed,matte is flat
DIY,not_removed,i would just clean it up really good including the old adhesive on the wall and use a construction adhesive we call it pl if you can take a and put it flat on the trim and then run another one to the opposite wall and wedge it it will hold it tight till it dries
DIY,not_removed,deleted
DIY,not_removed,this is part of the dead load trex is about double the weight of treated wood but this still represents a very small portion of the total load dead live from a quick googling you are increasing the load by about lbs per sq foot imagine if this balcony were full of people it would probably be lbs per square foot plus dead load plus a factor of safety i think you would be fine to use trex if the balcony were designed and constructed correctly in the first place if you were very concerned you could sister the support joists back into the house but this will likely be difficultexpensive tearing open floor in house go for it youll be fine
DIY,not_removed,if you can tell me the size and spacing of the joists ie on centre for example then i can tell you what the maximum load the cantilevered joists can hold is
DIY,not_removed,thank you i think balcony is original to the house so i hope the builder did it right to pass code out of curiosity do you know about how many people max are cantilevered decks of this size rated for since cantilever decks feels springy in general we are always afraid to have more than people on our deck would having like people be to many thanks
DIY,not_removed,its by and on center and we of them thanks
DIY,not_removed,the floor of the original house should be designed based on a live load per sq ft per building code probably around so if we were extremely conservative and said ft times sq ft thats lbs total or about people at lbs each just for curiosity sake how thick are the joists and how far apart are they
DIY,not_removed,ok assuming you have spf lumber pressure treated most common thing youll find at a hardware store for deck building with appropriate exterior exposure and treatment reduction factors applied you can resist a maximum factored uniformly distributed load on the cantilever of kpa that maximum factored resistance covers dead and live or snow loads dead loads get factored and livesnow get factored live is usually kpa for residential stuff psf snow in my area goes as high as kpa psf dead is going to be much less than live so youre ok loadwise no matter what deflection however is another issue entirely if you want very little deflection im going to go with whats called in which your m cantilever is only allowed to deflect at the free end a maximum of mm about a this restricts your unfactored live load to kpa this is still greater than the kpa i mentioned earlier so you really should not be seeing any deflection issues if all of your guests are standing right at the rail at the end that same mm deflection can be achieved with a line load of knm or lbft this is still an incredibly high load youd have to have a lot of people more than adult every foot all grouped at the end of your deck if theyre all jumping up and down then maybe its a problem its possible that your deflection issues are related to something other than the joists the beam below may be undersized the joists may be improperly secured to the beam or there is insufficient blocking between joists tldr your joists are sized fine assuming all other portions of the deck are sized appropriately and constructed properly it should be very difficult for you to achieve deflections of greater than even with fairly large loads in excess of psf which is a pretty standard design live load
DIY,not_removed,i am pretty sure we have joist about inch thick that runs along the length of the deck that is spaced about a foot or so from each other and beams that are thick that is along the length of the house and protrudes to support the deck are the joist and beam thick enough
DIY,not_removed,wow thank you so much for all the info i dont feel like i need to start kicking people off my deck after people now very interesting stuff
DIY,not_removed,i should have said how tall are they
DIY,not_removed,just measured it inch thick by inches wide
DIY,not_removed,what about the beams you say are thick how wide are they
DIY,not_removed,for width and we have of them
DIY,not_removed,ok this seems to meet the eyeball test in my opinion take a look at this this was a sort of quick and dirty analysis you were probably looking for to begin with go for it

DIY,not_removed,itll fucking stink but whenever anything pisses me off it gets the angle grinder
DIY,not_removed,something with long handles and lots of leverage like a bolt cutter
DIY,not_removed,since its running off a and probably only pulling something in the hundreds of ma gauge would probably be more than enough
DIY,not_removed,just an observation the sample video shown near the beginning showing the slide in action seems to periodically slow then resume speed as the camera moves its subtle and you may not notice it until you look for it is this the motor slowing down or is it an artifact of pulldown or some other video thing
DIY,not_removed,what you need is entirely dependent on a few factors which are a current b voltage and c does it need to bend and d is there vibration so since that thing runs on batteries a stranded pvc should be more then enough though on video it looks more like cable which is over kill
DIY,not_removed,can you point me to a site to get such stuff the one recommended in the video ships from china
DIY,not_removed,you tube and google surface mount wiring walls are too thin this is the easiest and best looking option i think good luck
DIY,not_removed,gold wires conduct electricity best
DIY,not_removed,electronics guy here yes use stranded wire as its more flexible than solid wire stranded wire is several strands of smaller wire twisted together
DIY,not_removed,thank you
DIY,not_removed,ill find out when i make it but i noticed it too
DIY,not_removed,digikey and mouser have lots of electronic parts ul wire would probably work for you but really any stranded will be fine awg sounds good
DIY,not_removed,that is incorrect silver and copper both have lower resistivity httpwwwtibtechcomconductivityphp gold doesnt oxidize when exposed to airwater that is why it is used in sensitive electronics
DIY,not_removed,use tinsel wire for flexible electronics
DIY,not_removed,great work i cant tell from the photos but do you have the slates at an angle either downward or upward to accommodate heels finally the most important question is about the last photo it looks like you treated yourself to a baked good for a job well done what did you have
DIY,not_removed,what software are you using
DIY,not_removed,would love to see it in use
DIY,not_removed,haha thanks it was a deep fried mars bar that myself and my girlfriend had last year basically a heart attack on a plate the slats are all level as i thought when it comes to overall footwear style i own they all are skater type sneakers so no heel plus if i end up not liking it then i can repurpose it as just a standard shelving unit thanks for the comment
DIY,not_removed,also hopefully this could show a better example of the slats
DIY,not_removed,autocad

DIY,not_removed,another first post to diy an allinone arcade controller meant for portability
DIY,not_removed,awesome work very professional looking better looking than the one you said you were imitating
DIY,not_removed,what games do you plan on playing with it
DIY,not_removed,every arcade gamer should have one of these
DIY,not_removed,the epoxy for the button symbols is a very nice touch same with the leds nice work buddy d
DIY,not_removed,very nice i think it would be a cleaner look if you fogcloud up the epoxy
DIY,not_removed,love the button labels
DIY,not_removed,where is the knob how can you play tempest
DIY,not_removed,whatever the computer can handle so far it seems to play pretty much everything supported from this list
DIY,not_removed,yes if i was going to do one thing over it would be this id add a little cornstarch into the mix to make it diffuse and maybe even a little acrylic paint of the same color of the led as it stands i ended up using a diffuse sheet of plastic behind the epoxy anyway
DIY,not_removed,superglue
DIY,not_removed,you mean a window cling theyre not really adhesive use an adhesive spray
DIY,not_removed,like for models or do you mean bumper stickers because there is a difference if they are from models you need to follow the instructions for adhering them to a model if they are regular bumper sticker types then they should stick with out a problem unless the wood has a lacquer on it i would trace the sticker where you want it to go sand the inside of the area you traced and put the sticker on
DIY,not_removed,it is a cling thanks for helping me couldnt think of the word i thought i might have to resort to adhesive spray ill give it a shot thanks
DIY,not_removed,they are sort of like bumper stickers they are meant to go on the glass window of your car ill try what you said and see if it works thanks
DIY,not_removed,was this cheaper than buying a guitar or did you do it as a project for fun how much did it cost you this is really cool by the way
DIY,not_removed,looks great op
DIY,not_removed,nice construction fella turned out swell totaling at i assume usd this is a solid buy would love to make my own gat someday
DIY,not_removed,looks good a few things i noticed though the springs on your saddles actually go on the screws between the bridge and saddle not on the ends this is how you set the intonation the other thing i noticed is that you removed the ground wire from the tremolo claw the other end of that wire gets soldiered to the back of one of the pots if left off you can get a lot of buzzing when plugged into the amp other than those two easy fixes the guitar looks great
DIY,not_removed,looks awesome is there anything you would do differently next time im thinking of building a guitar myself next year and looking for any lessons learned im curious why you didnt refinish the body while you were at it it kind of looks like it has seen some better days maybe that was the look you were going for though

DIY,not_removed,thanks man it ended up coming up to about so a better price than most guitars i ended up getting the american strat neck for so im pretty proud of that it really was mostly for fun though
DIY,not_removed,thanks
DIY,not_removed,thanks i had read online that the ground wire on the tremolo claw wasnt necessary and i thought it would get in the way of the springs tt this is only the second one ive done though and the last one was a kit that just came with a wiring diagram for a setup with more pots than i got with the kit haha
DIY,not_removed,another dude told me that i kinda messed up on this one so id put the springs on the screw between the saddle and bridge instead of the end and keep the ground wire on the tremolo claw going to fix that up when i restring this one i think i might try and make the guitar body from scratch next time i just need to find someone who would let me use the tools haha as for the finish i really wanted it to look like it was used and used and used i wanted it to look like a part from another guitar that i had used for this one to be honest it does look kinda shitty and i would recommend anyone else go ahead and refinish it if looks like it was rode hard and put away wet isnt the look youre going for
DIY,not_removed,it wouldnt get in the way its usually soldered on that little nib in the middle on the claw and ran through the hole in the back of the body if you have any questions about it feel free to pm me ive wired and built a lot of guitars
DIY,not_removed,ive got a router so i could theoretically make my own body to my mind i think i could make my own neck too but everyone seems pretty unanimous that this is an absolutely awful idea for a to building guitars so ill end up buying that one if the used look was what you were going for then you got it and have no reason not to be happy with it

DIY,not_removed,i think ikea sells markers that match their color you could try filling it and then matching over another probably better option is to try the method people use for laminate flooring with dents
DIY,not_removed,it doesnt look scratched so much as indented youd have to fill the indent with something of a similar color or paintpen over it probably not worth it
DIY,not_removed,brown crayon then white chalk
DIY,not_removed,ive seen people marking wood when clamping it in place very hard they usually put humidity into the wood to make it pop back out you put water on a towel and iron the towel in contact with the dent i dont know if this would work with the ikea finish though
DIY,not_removed,oh i didnt watch the video completely i have seen others use an iron try searching around for one
DIY,not_removed,as udustinpdx suggests use a hot iron with a cloth underneath practice first on an inconspicuous bit ikea stuff is cheaply made so be careful trying to fix it
DIY,not_removed,its ikea its basically a chance of there actually being wood fibers under that youre more likely to have soggy cardboard i love ikea it serves a great purpose for inexpensive furniture that looks pretty good hell i just installed a full walk in closet from ikea including having to cut it for size in various areas it looks good but its basically cardboard anywhere that a screw doesnt directly enter
DIY,not_removed,this is exactly what i came to suggest just be careful doing it this looks like a veneered particle board and you dont want to release the veneer gluing

DIY,not_removed,it will be louder and the heat of compression will be inside as well not ideal at all
DIY,not_removed,the problem is that youre blowing room air out the ac needs to draw air for the hot side condenser from the outside move it back until the horizontal side slots are outside
DIY,not_removed,well speaking from a thermodynamic point of view it will exchange heat but why would you want to do it like that they are designed to be flush with the window if you are worried about supporting the back of the unit get one of these
DIY,not_removed,get a split unit
DIY,not_removed,the vertical slots are for the gapfilling accordion fold spacers they are supposed to be over the windowsill
DIY,not_removed,the only problem is that the window casing we have seems to be fixedglued in or even all one piece we were trying to pry it out but it seems like its not going to happen here is a pic of the window the one that slides came out but the fixed one seems to have no give at all do you have any ideas of how i may be able to remove that window or do you think its a lost cause thanks man
DIY,not_removed,support is not the problem the problem the window is too narrow as only one of the windows slides the other one seems to be glued in or something do you know anything about trying to remove a window like that we tryed prying it out but no luck heres what it looks like
DIY,not_removed,i would try running a thin blade like a putty knife all the way around inside and out between the window and frame also look for security screws
DIY,not_removed,the other problem youll have is the condensate drain may drip onto your floor
DIY,not_removed,if the window really is fixed then you need a casementslider ac
DIY,not_removed,push the window up and the bottom will clear the lower track then gently push it out bottom first

DIY,not_removed,professional woodworker for years chiming in oil based finishes are able to be toned to even out the color with a good hvlp or lvlp gun you will want to do a scruff coat on your poly first and then spray your toner very sparingly to even out the color i would go with a dye and shellac or poly from
DIY,not_removed,without providing pics it sound like the only option is sanding and restaining which isnt an option try doing that and using way less stain let dry in a couple layers
DIY,not_removed,use wood conditioner prior to staining as well cuts down on the blotch
DIY,not_removed,resanding and staining is not an option its your only option
DIY,not_removed,the panel must come off after the lock comes out the inverse of how it must have been put together to be on there like that see if you can remove the lock cylinder then remove the plate tighten the screws up then replace the plate then the lock the screw to release the lock cylinder will be on the small edge of the door usually just below the latch
DIY,not_removed,there should be a set screw in the handle
DIY,not_removed,got it ended up having to take out essentially every screw forcing the lock out when it was turned to the right position and handdrilling a new hole with a spare screw and my screwdriver for a missing screw that the original installers never bothered to put in the existing threads were fucked and the wood was split so i suppose it was sort of a blessing anyway its a bodge job but it works and its a student house so most things are sort of bodged together anyway cheers
DIY,not_removed,no problem good job getting it sorted

DIY,not_removed,id replace it it might warp and that would suck after laying tile
DIY,not_removed,depends on the climate you are in the more humid the more you should just replace it if mold will be easy to control dry it out with some heat and fans make sure you confirm where the leak was coming from find some kind of product you can put on the wood to make sure it wont get mold if you can pull it up to get a better look at it that would be good then go from there in restoring or replacing as for the drywall if you have mold resistant you should be okay letting it dry just keep an eye on it
DIY,not_removed,definitely pull it out spray the joists with something like concrobium to kill the moldmildew spore then put some nailers between the joists so you have something to secure the new plywood to along the walls just remember not to tile directly tot he plywood that is not an acceptable installation method if you use something good like tg advantech you can use a later of ditra membrane before tile and your install will last virtually forever
DIY,not_removed,plumber here 😊 theres a pretty good chance the water is coming from either a blown wax seal under the toilet or leakage from the supply line to the toilet i just did a reno for a customer with the same situation in there ensuite bathroom the toilet flange was level with the height of the floor so when the seal gave water would leak with every flush i removed all the subfloor then replaced it with plywood installed a flange extension then reinstalled the toilet good bye leak 😊 a good way to tell if the sub floor needs replacing is by using a flat head screw driver and test how solid the wood is if its breaking apart with ease then replace
DIY,not_removed,so yes i did crawl under the house past midnight on a weeknight swearing profusely would it have killed them to build the house an extra inches off the ground the damage doesnt actually look too bad but i am leaning towards going ahead and replacing the plywood anyway im just going to cut it along the walls the drywall is still dry and it doesnt appear to have spread past the walls plus it gives me an excuse to buy that milwaukee cordless multi tool heres some shots from underneath
DIY,not_removed,replace the subfloor youll probably lose any trim around the perimeter when you do this but youll get a good look at the drywall at the same time if the drywall is damaged its probably only the bottom foot or less you can draw a line and score it with a blade to remove a section then cut the same width out of a new sheet and screw it intape and mud seams new trim could be installed after you tile this will allow you to avoid installing shoe mold later to cover gaps
DIY,not_removed,what is the question here should you replace that subfloor my god look at it your current subfloor is toast it going to take you how long to pull up the existing subfloor floor and replace it with cement board why would anyone even consider spending time and money tiling over that subfloor pull out the toilet pull out the subfloor check and replace damaged joist install new cement board subfloor tile on new clean level surface clean out closet flange install new wax ring reinstall toilet with new fasteners twenty year life span tile over what you show in your photographs five year life span max
DIY,not_removed,thanks for the info im in northern california so its bone dry for most of the year i used greenboard so it should be mold resistant ive got a fan running in there right now so hopefully it will dry out in a couple days its just that moment of panic when you pull up a floor and its wet underneath ill be crawling under the house tomorrow and see just how bad it looks under there
DIY,not_removed,thanks for the advice im pretty sure it was the wax gasket i did a partial renovation about years ago new tub shower surround fixtures drywall but ran out of money before i got to replace the floor and toilet it was always one of those round tuits that i kept putting off but i remember that the toilet flange was below the floor level and the standard wax gasket that i put in seemed iffy when i put the toilet back in ill check out those flange extensions when i go to the hardware store today hopefully that will prevent this issue from happening again
DIY,not_removed,yeah i think youre right the floor still feels solid but after drying it out it seems pretty warped i already have backer board and all the materials i need to to lay the tile so ill only be out the cost of a sheet of plywood and a couple to go ahead and replace it thanks for pointing me in the right direction
DIY,not_removed,yeah water is no joke especially here in florida sounds like you have it under control good luck
DIY,not_removed,it looks like its been leaking for a while but i dont see a lot of mold if the drywall is soft you will probably have to cut the bottom few inches and replace
DIY,not_removed,good man its so much better to do it right the first time than do have to do it over again

DIY,not_removed,go to your local used appliance store or habitat for humanity and find the smallest refrigerator you can find think dorm room size if possible get a hole saw and drill two four inch holes in the sides one high on the right side and the other low on the left side over the lower hole screw one of these the other hole gets one of these screwed to the outside now buy a few pieces of pvc straight elbows anything you think would be good to direct the air to the area the plants are sitting since cold air falls perhaps run it to the roof of the enclosure over the plant stands now turn it on in a few minutes you should feel cool air falling gently over the open rack shelving that your plants will sit on now you need to control it buy one or two of these plug the small fridge into one outlet and the fan into the other if you want them separate turn the internal thermostat on the fridge to the lowest setting you can it will stay there till the end of time it will not be needed to control the temps the outlet controller will do that finished total cost maybe to usd depending on what kind of bargain you drive for the little fridge and you can use it for a second duty it will keep your drinks cold while you are puttering amongst the greenery
DIY,not_removed,you could also use a peltier cooler not as efficient as phase change cooling but a lot smaller since you only need to chill a small area by a relatively small temp it should work well just a peltier cooler heat sinks and fans cpu heat sinks would work well then you need a temp controller
DIY,not_removed,fyi a better option is storm water pipe than pvc when not under pressure works just as good as a sleeve etc but cost you about for instead of
DIY,not_removed,wow thanks so much thats an awesome idea
DIY,not_removed,wow fuarked you pay many times more for pvc than we do out here meters would be a little over usd and or per coupling wonder why that is
DIY,not_removed,for class pvc wow im in aus so that would be why i guess but didnt expect that big of a difference
DIY,not_removed,i am surprised as well perhaps construction costs are much higher in your part of the world
DIY,not_removed,looks like veneer and looks like its toast but for or less it would be fun to see what you could do with it
DIY,not_removed,you could try a chemical stripper and then follow up with very light sanding just to get it smooth again then stain and reseal

DIY,not_removed,or op could after stripping and sanding use paint or varnish depending on the lookfinish required
DIY,not_removed,well he said refinish the top but paint the legs so im guessing he wants to stain it again or he could have just said he wants to paint it

DIY,not_removed,aye its all good i taped the barrel back on now i can run around in the street with it
DIY,not_removed,nawww son power rangers bandaids
DIY,not_removed,not arguing the legal status of yours but intent or ability to make it functional again is the same legally as it being fully functional like having a rifle with no barrel attached and a inch barrel stored in a closet can be used to charge you with illegal possession of an unregistered short barreled rifle
DIY,not_removed,youll want something like this for the frame httpwwwanythinginstainedglasscomfinishingzincbrassrebarhtml probably what they call h channel has a slot for the glass on either side the glass ones would be common for a smaller one local glass shop should be able to get you a or sheet of clear glass cheaper than youll get it from home depot local artscrafts store or stained glass place would have the framingchannel or find a place that repairs leaded glass front doors they would also probably have it

DIY,not_removed,maybe i am just ignorant but what is your questionwhat are you trying to achieve
DIY,not_removed,are you asking if you should replace the sheetrock
DIY,not_removed,i believe the question is does he need to put up a beam because the walls were in fact load bearing i am not an expert on the topic i know typically the joists are joined at the support beam but can they be joined without a support beam for other reasons i do not know if this is the center of the joists then i would guess you need to put something back whether it be a wall or a beam not an expert though

DIY,not_removed,you are correct you sun has really faded it quite a bit i would differ on one part of your plan if you are thinking about using an oil based stain then you should use an oil based deck oil or sealer dont mix water and oil based products i dont think you will have much luck with removing the old stain because it is in the pores of the decking you want it gone you are going to have to sand the deck clean down to unstained product id use oil based products when coloring it because ive found that they are much more durable than water based products and i am too damn busy to keep doing this over and over im lazy i admit it deck work cuts into my beer time
DIY,not_removed,shouldnt there be gaps between the boards i guess its too late to worry about that i built a deck a month ago using red cedar stained with one coat of house brand stainsealer from home depot us supposedly good for years rain water stays beaded up on the surface all night so it seems to be well sealed
DIY,not_removed,i would pressure wash the deck first and see if some of those places will clean up dont get the spray nozzle too close to the surface
DIY,not_removed,that looks like a hardwood deck not the stuff we commonly use in the states most hardwoods used for decking are naturally rot resistant so you are looking mainly at a cosmetic issue definitely start with a good cleaning via pressure washer and detergent let it dry out well for about days then apply an appropriate stain deck stains are generally a one product system now meaning you dont need multiple products sometimes you will need more than one coat depending on what the specific product you are using calls for in you case having a hardwood deck dont over do it with stain application those types of woods tend to not absorb as much product as a softer pine or cedar would some of the really good decking woods like ipe are so oily and dense that you actually have to wipe them down with acetone before staining to get then to absorb any stain at all
DIY,not_removed,thanks
DIY,not_removed,get scrubbing then stain it
DIY,not_removed,hard to tell exactly what wood this is to me it looks like teak do some research to figure what it is of the products you find will be for pine or cedar and may not be appropriate for your wood if it is teak it would have cost a lot more than even a cedar deck do your research
DIY,not_removed,shouldnt there be gaps between the boards depends if its a soft wood the school of thought is to push it close together and let the spaces form naturally as the wood dries up the fear is if you gap a soft wood when it dries your gap will be too big i think everyone has their own way of doing it though as i have heard both schools of thought several times from several professional builders
DIY,not_removed,thanks
DIY,not_removed,thanks staining the last step no deck oil on top
DIY,not_removed,with quarterinch or so gaps its a lot easier to sweep the deck if you have a lot of leaves and crap that fall on it stuff doesnt get jammed in the crevices i dont suppose its an issue if there arent any trees around
DIY,not_removed,the bolt will not be enough unless it is connected to metal that is connected to the negative post of the battery you have to complete a circuit for a light to work
DIY,not_removed,the ground needs a continous metal connection back to the battery negative the bolt in wood that you are describing attaching it to attaching it to would be a floating metal that is not considered grounded
DIY,not_removed,is this a kit harbor freighthaul master if yes my experience is that the frame makes a horrible ground because its painted i had to run a separate ground wire on mine to the trailer tounge
DIY,not_removed,green right turnbrake yellow left turnbrake brown clearance blue elecbrakes large white is ground black is supply to trailer for accessories the white is often connected to the frame making the frame part of the circuit if the trailer lights blink on and off when moving the ground is probably going through the ball hitch and the wiringwhite is open back to the tow vehicle
DIY,not_removed,the red goes to positive the black goes to negative the ground goes to any bare metal the bolt wont be enough but use your grinder and grind a bare spot on the frame and bolt the ground through the bare spot spray paint over top so it doesnt rust after
DIY,not_removed,this you need to ground it to the frame of the trailer if you dont believe us try it your way and youll find out that the lights wont work and then youll do it correctly
DIY,not_removed,the ground is not intended to be connected to the negative part of the battery though that would also work they advise you to connect it to the frame of the trailer but it would require me drilling a hole in the frame to place a bolt which id like to avoid if i can edit i was wrong looks like connecting it to the trailer frame connects back to a ground wire from the harness from my car which is also attached to the trailer frame makes sense now
DIY,not_removed,black goes to negative which is a ground same thing the negative post of a battery is connected to the frame so anywhere on the frame is a ground
DIY,not_removed,i believe you thats why im asking one thing i did not realize is the wiring harness from my car has a groundnegative wire and when connected to the harness on my trailer that wire connects to a bolt on my trailer frame so connecting the ground wire of the light to the trailer frame essentially completes the circuit makes sense now for some reason i didnt make the mental connection of ground negative
DIY,not_removed,i think the point is the frame of the trailer is connected to the frame of the tow vehicle which is connected to the battery so a bolt going only through wood isnt grounding anything
DIY,not_removed,thru the tailer ball or receiver from the trailer frame the light will find the ground of the car or truck battery a single steel bolt in wood doesnt get to ground when you take the advice about screwing it to the frame yes drill the hole you provide the pathway to the car battery negative you dont have to run a wire to the battery but the metal of the frame through to the car is your ground edit to add metal large or small doesnt ground a circuit by itself
DIY,not_removed,i see that now thank you exactly what i was trying to figure out somehow i didnt mentally make the connection that the groundwire negative on the battery to complete the circuit
DIY,not_removed,the mass of the metal does not matter it simply needs to attached to the frame the plug at the tongue is also grounded to the frame and thats how the system is grounded to the car and the battery because the battery is grounded to the frame of the car just attach the ground to the frame
DIY,not_removed,now i see that thank you
DIY,not_removed,thank you this is what i was looking for
DIY,not_removed,stick dynamat to the back of it
DIY,not_removed,pull it off line it with thin weather stripping screw the back plate back on tightly no more rattles
DIY,not_removed,caulk it from the inside
DIY,not_removed,remove it
DIY,not_removed,rent a grinder and a diamond cup wheel grind the whole thing vac and epoxy it source years of epoxy application
DIY,not_removed,we use a lot of general polymers you can get it at sherwin williams its about a gallon so its not much more than a good paint with it being a gym i would highly suggest tossing quarts sand into the epoxy after its rolled on they call it ceramic carpet at sherwin williams
DIY,not_removed,if your just wanting to resurface the floor and level it out id use a concrete floor topping like dayton superior level topping its a very user friendly product depending on your location you can usually find a local distributor on the manufacturers website source years sales rep selling concrete related construction products
DIY,not_removed,the guy who does the polished concrete makes the big bucks
DIY,not_removed,thank ive spent some time with a grinder any epoxy recommendations
DIY,not_removed,yeah and do a diy once you get it done you can do it
DIY,not_removed,this may be a dumb question but why do you need to grind the floor first
DIY,not_removed,never trust a sandy vag
DIY,not_removed,your not going to find general polymers in every sw location also they shouldnt be selling to gp to home owners as its a difficult system to apply for someone off the street a two part epoxy like tile clad is a easier system to apply you would only need kit gallon a gallon b couldnt probably even do coats with it
DIY,not_removed,is the dayton product one you could simply seal and have as the flooring or is it typically used as a substrate is it susceptible to cracking i realize any thin cementbased material will crack but some leveling compounds seem to crack more than others
DIY,not_removed,on the angle grinder youre better off buying one rental is diamond cup purchase for i bought a nice milwaukee angle grinder useful tool to have anyhow i just epoxied my garage i bought all my product from a place out of michigan
DIY,not_removed,to open op the surface of the concrete so the epoxy or any paint for that matter can really grab the surface
DIY,not_removed,you can always trust a sandyvag on the floor just not in the bed
DIY,not_removed,thankfully i have about three of every hand tool imaginable including angle grinders that being said id probably just rent a concrete floor grinder with a couple of different grits of grinding blocks its pretty rough and that would make fairly quick work of it
DIY,not_removed,thanks
DIY,not_removed,lol just confirmed skeptical at first but its true
DIY,not_removed,exploding bricks looks very nice btw
DIY,not_removed,i really like this project ive been looking to doing this same thing this summer every example i find is very involved dig down a minimum amount line with various grades of fill lay bricks lay more a different bricks ect yours is nice and simple and only semipermanent great post thanks very much
DIY,not_removed,im old and in decades ive only seen one explosion from a fire ring or pit and that was a fresh river rock wet and it probably was steam that caused it to break with some violence the whole ring was river rock and only the one broke apart fire was hot enough to melt beer bottles and cans tooso there is that the main issue is one of longevity and ongoing maintenance cycles of heat rain sun etc are accelerated in a fire pit so using rated materials will prolong your enjoyment without having to rebuild fix repair etc
DIY,not_removed,keep an eye on those retaining wall blocks those are usually not rated for fire pits like that and can break from the heat i would look into a steel ring to act as a fire barrier in the inside of that unless you just want to keep buying new blocks when those break looks great
DIY,not_removed,very nice im curious if you had a reason for building the pit on top of the base bricks rather than the ground just curious as i have plans to do something similar down the road
DIY,not_removed,are the bricks upside down
DIY,not_removed,looks much betteri have a similar one to your old one and the wife hates it btw its tamper and tamping not stamper etc heres a nice tamper if you ever decide to get one
DIY,not_removed,every thread has people warning about exploding bricks ignoring the countless number of people who do this without issue the reality is that the most likely worst case scenario is that the bricks show age maybe one splits and one or more need replacing in or years
DIY,not_removed,thanks i told my wife when planning it i want this to be done for about and us be able to do it in less than a day worked out pretty well hopefully itll give ya some inspiration
DIY,not_removed,these look like the blocks i was going to use in my project they manufacturer actually puts out plans including them in building a fire pit
DIY,not_removed,my yard doesnt drain that well being in a coastal southern city it rains a lot especially during the summer so reasons really i wanted to make sure that i built it raised off the ground so when it did rain the firepit would drain because my yard doesnt drain that well i was concerned just building it on the ground wet soggy dirt may shift under the weight of the stones after a hard rain and cause it to become unlevel i dont think it would have ever collapsed because of this reason but i didnt want to take the chance just do it right the first time kinda thing
DIY,not_removed,yes because we knocked off the lips we could have placed them the other way round but it really didnt matter
DIY,not_removed,somehow i knew when i was typing it that wasnt correct hah ill fix that the next project ill need a tamper for will be large enough new paved patio im going to rend a motorized one
DIY,not_removed,i could probably work without incident for years without wearing safety glasses but that doesnt mean im going to stop wearing them
DIY,not_removed,sucks doesnt it my yard is all kinds of sloped and the ground is all kinds of shitty im at the lowest point on the block and end up with a lake in one side of the yard im going to be digging down about tamping the hell out of it and filling with gravel before i lay down my pit
DIY,not_removed,lol its all good i used that particular tamper to do a patio from crushed granite probably square feet its an upper body workout for sure if i had to do it again id probably just rent the one from hd but the thing really comes in handy in the back yard so i like to have it around
DIY,not_removed,but i can find you examples of people who have suffered eye injury and i cant find you examples of people who have suffered from exploding firepit bricks i find references to the idea that they could explode sure but thats all anyone offers and contractors love to tell you stories like this lest you diy instead of hire a contractor can you find examples the internet is too littered by people throwing gasoline in fires to return any decent results which end of the spectrum are you on are these like dynamite bricks blowing up the whole yard or would any little crack do to justify your worry if one pops and splits into pieces is that enough is it something most people would look at and say wow for aesthetic reasons its time to replace that brick ive known too many people to use any random bricks on firepits to be remotely worried about the idea of exploding bricks im more worried about the people around the firepit doing something stupid it is more likely right and yet ill still chill and have a beer
DIY,not_removed,im actually near the end of a culdesac so everything in the front yard drains into the street rather well but the back yard has so many low and and uneven spots i get quite a few yard lake situations one of my next projects will be to install french drains through my backyard and tie them into the curb in the front yard to help with the drainage it really concerns me because part of the low spots are near the house and i dont want the foundation getting messed up over the long term the house is only years old trying to protect my investment while making it pretty
DIY,not_removed,its an upper body workout for sure you can say that again i bought a tamp years ago coincidentally when i built a fire pit at our last house and i can attest to the forearm soreness that set in
DIY,not_removed,yeah worth it unfortunately mine is years old and im renting the i sink into doing the fire pit right is about all the money ill leave behind at this place
DIY,not_removed,if possible post a pic of where youre trying to mount it that would give a better idea of your options
DIY,not_removed,as long as the brackets you are using to hold up the table are rated for the weight it should be fine make sure they are secured into studs in the wall that countertop seems very expensive for what you want they sell laminated boards are home depotlowes that would cost you way less it is a good idea to get it cut down to the size you need also the brackets will have a hole on the top for a screw put at least one screw from underneath to hold the tabletop in place
DIY,not_removed,i speak from experience put something to protect your window from your feet lattice clear acrylic whatever to prevent you from kicking out your window
DIY,not_removed,this took me about hours to complete i was asked by our local all out baseball league to build a sign for their annual fundraiser let me know what you think

DIY,not_removed,the style is called damask i think
DIY,not_removed,not sure what the fabric is made of but the pattern is called damask
DIY,not_removed,it might just be a printed pattern on cotton try searching damask print sheets not ideal for sewing but it will give you a big piece
DIY,not_removed,to add to what others have said unfortunately its not likely that youll find the exact same style or colour scheme because there is a ton of variation in damask prints your best bet is to look for something similar that you like on a website with a large inventory like httpswwwfabriccomhomedecorfabricaspxfabricpatterndamask hope this helps
DIY,not_removed,if its any help fabrics that are a jacquard weave or just jacquard often have this sort of pattern and will give you dimension and texture more accurate to your image
DIY,not_removed,the pattern is sort of a hybrid its like a paisley design in a damask pattern you could find something similar by searching for some of the following keywords paisley damask indian red i found these which are similar but not exactly spot on it looks like you found the fabric from an ok go album cover it would be worth sending them an email to see if they have any information on it they actually list contact emails on their website httpokgonetinfo lastly i once had luck finding a bit of lace by contacting an etsy seller based out of china i sent her a few pictures of the lace i needed that was discontinued a few years prior she was able to find one that was identical and it was very affordable the seller i used only sells lace otherwise i would recommend her im sure it wont be hard to find a chinabased fabric supplier
DIY,not_removed,that pantry is nicer than most peoples room very fancy i love the contrasting dark and light bright wallpaper
DIY,not_removed,awesome idea for the vertical can goods going to put it to good use looks great
DIY,not_removed,awesome job definitely has inspired me to redo our pantry in the same fashion from what i could see in the pictures it appears that the vertical load is being handled by the ikea cabinet cleats and the pocket screws have you found this to be more than sufficient in holding up the shelving and miscellaneous pantry items
DIY,not_removed,you either have a big family or are preparing for the end of the world
DIY,not_removed,this pantry is now amazing fantastic work
DIY,not_removed,do you have any pictures of how the shelves are pocket screwed in to the walls it looks ridiculously clean
DIY,not_removed,first half of this project is
DIY,not_removed,good job i like the vertical can dispensers
DIY,not_removed,great job how did you anchor the shelves to the wall simply with pocket hole screws
DIY,not_removed,looks beautiful im not that experienced and i suspect a lot of it is having the right tools but i tried making a desk out of by this week the glue is currently drying similar to how you made the counter tops out of biscuited together unfortunately my desk has gaps in between the boards because i over sanded the edges in some areas could you elaborate on how you made the counter tops a tad
DIY,not_removed,great work it looks phenomenal i really appreciate the use of for the shelving
DIY,not_removed,i love it what stain did you use on the stool
DIY,not_removed,love the organization looks great and functional more importantly though you are one badass mom
DIY,not_removed,can you link to the ikea cabinets you used
DIY,not_removed,i thought the pic with the wire shelving was your finished project and i screamed inside myself im slowly eradicating it all in my house i have come to hate that stuff i like your whole project the can storage is impressive
DIY,not_removed,til existence of httpswwwredditcomrpantryporn sugest xpost
DIY,not_removed,the can rack is intriguing where did you find that at
DIY,not_removed,great now install sink fridge and an oven and you have yourself a spare kitchen
DIY,not_removed,how much tomato soup do yall eat
DIY,not_removed,ive uploaded a video walkthrough for anyone who is interested it has some more up close views of how the shelves are attached as well umildlystiff ukramericallc uborox uworklogin
DIY,not_removed,looks awesome out of curiosity since i couldnt find it mentioned what are the dimensions of the pantry if you dont mind i am trying to figure out some plans with mine and the size seems similar
DIY,not_removed,i hope you die for putting up wallpaper i just bought a house that has wallpaper everywhere and removing it makes me want to kill myself all jokes aside looks good
DIY,not_removed,i hope you beefed up the size of the screws holding the hinges on that door
DIY,not_removed,thanks im a little afraid of wallpaper so i figured this was a good place to try some out
DIY,not_removed,we do use it all the time its definitely a space saver
DIY,not_removed,its very sturdy the shelves to the right of the cabinet are screwed into the side of the cabinet as well the shelves on the back wall are only held by pocket screws but they are screwed into walls some of the side ones didnt hit a stud because they were only deep so i used drywall anchors that shelf on the bottom of the back wall is usually filled with bottled and canned drinks and it hasnt moved or sagged at all
DIY,not_removed,there are six of us of which are teenage boys
DIY,not_removed,my family has only and we have way more than this and we arent heavy eaters
DIY,not_removed,i appreciate that i like to go in there when the rest of my house is wrecked and take a few deep breaths 😄
DIY,not_removed,i think i might if not ill take a few pics tomorrow 😊 edit httpwwwwoodbincomcalcssagulator it determines the amount of sag your shelf will have over a given distance and weight yep i was in there weighing my groceries because im that person
DIY,not_removed,in the meantime you can see the screwholes in the shelves themselves on the pictures of me staining them when i dryfitted them i marked where they would hit studs and predrilled them since the pocketholes go in at an angle from above it makes them extra sturdy like when you drive a nail at an angle to hold a heavy frame
DIY,not_removed,thanks 😊 edit added link
DIY,not_removed,mostly the shelve above and below the cabinet as well as the ones to the right of it are screwed directly to the cabinet also the back wall is all pocket hole screws screwed into walls on one side it didnt reach another stud so i used metal drywall anchors however it holds a lot of weight i usually fill the bottom shelf with bottled and canned drinks and there is no sag or movement
DIY,not_removed,no problem the tool that helped the most was a planer instead of trying to rip or sand the edges down i sent the boards through the planer on their sides i would send or through together so they supported each other and made it like one thick block of wood you probably couldnt do that way because it would be too thick however i really recommend the even though it seems like more work to me it seems like they are easier to force together thats why butcherblock pieces are thin but if you were able to get the edges very square it would be no problem i helped a friend do a counter with and it didnt turn out as well it had a lot of gaps like you described she ended up just using some filler and staining it its not that noticeable and she was going for rustic so it all worked out after planing the edges i biscuited glued and clamped in sections or less so i could send the whole thing through the planer the shallower shelf sections were able to go through in one piece the deep sections in two i tried to get them as close to the same thickness as possible so id have less sanding after all was glued in its final widths i used a belt sander to level it then a palm sander to smooth it out after dyeing it one time i lightly sanded again two more coats of dye to get it really dark then three coats of poly thats it this whole pantry project was a practice run for building cabinets and counters in my craft room i needed an countertop in there and wanted to make sure i could do it before i wasted that much wood 😳
DIY,not_removed,the same as the counters
DIY,not_removed,😘
DIY,not_removed,i bought these when they still had akurum cabinet frames theyve now switched to sektion which i think is a little deeper the bottom one is x the top is x
DIY,not_removed,yeah i kinda messed up my imgur album i tried to fix it but it still wont show up the right way on reddit thanks for taking the time to give it a second look i am vehemently anti wire shelving were doing the same im going to make this same shelving for all of the closets in the house eventually
DIY,not_removed,thanks i will
DIY,not_removed,i designed and built it
DIY,not_removed,😂 there actually is a mini fridge right across from the door i guess i better get working on that sink
DIY,not_removed,there are cans there not sure how thats overkill but ok
DIY,not_removed,thanks it is almost exactly x
DIY,not_removed,im in the same boat thought it was a regular painted wall but apparently the people before us just painted over the wallpaper so when i pulled down the curtain rod hardware some of it peeled off surprise now i want to burn down the house
DIY,not_removed,i do agree im not a wallpaper fan because ive had to remove it before i used to be a real estate agent and i had this one listing where every freaking room was wallpapered even the ceiling in the frog was done i tried and tried to get them to have it removed man that thing sat on the market forever but im trying to expand my horizons a little i figured a closet it the safest place to experiment😆
DIY,not_removed,its hung on the wall not the door it just utilizes the wall space behind the door
DIY,not_removed,op should just rehang the door to be outward swinging or maybe go with half doors
DIY,not_removed,roughly equivalent to adults
DIY,not_removed,it really isnt that much food i buy a lot of fresh stuff too but its good to have staples on hand i have more in the garage shhh dont tell the others edit clarification
DIY,not_removed,that is such a neat tool makes me want to be more handy nice job on your pantry
DIY,not_removed,thanks for the response a planer would definitely of helped my endeavors nevertheless with a bit of filler and stain i think its going to come out nicely keep an eye out for my first diy post in the next few days d
DIY,not_removed,i might have missed it but how did you attach the shelves to the wall it looks like you used a single bracket against the studs but is that enough to secure weight on the shelves i would love not to use the standard angle brackets but i worried about too much products breaking the shelves and young kids trying to climb on them as we have a toddler that will probably try climbing things eventually here
DIY,not_removed,i could but its really not an inconvenience to have to go in and open the door a bit to get to the very back it seems like more work than its worth it to have to mortise for hinges and strike plate then fill the old holes not to mention everyone leaves that door open all the time and it would block the hallway from kitchen to dining room i appreciate your input though thanks for taking the time to comment 😊
DIY,not_removed,😂 yes at least
DIY,not_removed,absolutely i recall eating boxes of cereal and most of a gallon of milk in a sitting perhaps once a month normally it was one box per meal large pizza no sweat dozen tacos hope we have chips and salsa too teenage boys dont eat food they hide it in their stomachs
DIY,not_removed,sweet cant wait to see it
DIY,not_removed,the bracket you see is actually the rail that the ikea cabinets come with to hang them i only used pocket hole screws to attach the shelves to the studs its much stronger than you think i have a and year old who also climb and ive even stood on the counter section myself at the end i show how theyre attached and how sturdy they are hope that helps
DIY,not_removed,it extends beyond the door itself so we keep the items we use most on that end but it isnt as inconvenient as it seems if youre facing the rack you may have to pull the door out a bit to reach something back there but it doesnt seem like a big deal the whole pantry is with counter on the back wall and counter on the right the can holder is so you have a space to stand in thats edit removed link because im an idiot and posted the link to this same post 😜
DIY,not_removed,at least the shelves were positioned to not interfere with the inner handle looks like it works for you thats kinda important
DIY,not_removed,jethro bowl ftw thats what my dad called it back around entire box of cereal in one go
DIY,not_removed,😂
DIY,not_removed,definitely thanks for you help and video
DIY,not_removed,i just have to remember not to put glass jars there 😳
DIY,not_removed,youre welcome
DIY,not_removed,not ones you want to keep anyways
DIY,not_removed,sorry one more thing i assume the first shelf height is just a standard counter height shelf like the counters in my kitchen are from the floor i like the spacing of your pantry setup but what height is the first shelf setup at also how how high did you place each shelf after im assuming yours was setup on an wall
DIY,not_removed,yep the counter is about the cabinet was and i placed it above our baseboard the next one is about the next have in between the height of the upper cabinet is but you could use another cabinet instead that left me with about a foot above the top shelf
DIY,not_removed,i just thought of one more thing when you joined the together did you use wood filler in between the so the shelf was smooth overall seems like any dip would gather up a lot of dustdirt
DIY,not_removed,the tool that helped the most was a planer instead of trying to rip or sand the edges down i sent the boards through the planer on their sides i would send or through together so they supported each other and made it like one thick block of wood you could use a jointer if you have access to one but its probably easier to find a friend with a planer than a jointer you could always rip the edges with a table saw to square it up if you can find either one after planing the edges i biscuited glued and clamped in sections of or less so i could send the whole thing through the planer the shallower shelf sections were able to go through in one piece the deep sections in two i tried to get them as close to the same thickness as possible so id have less sanding after all was glued in its final widths i used a belt sander to level it then a palm sander to smooth it out after dyeing it one time i lightly sanded again two more coats of dye to get it really dark then three coats of poly
DIY,not_removed,actually i dont have either i was thinking about using a circular saw with a rip guide to take a little off then biscuit joining them together
DIY,not_removed,that should work squeeze together pretty well maybe just dryfit them together first to see which way has fewer gaps or try to put all of the gaps on the side you wont see
DIY,not_removed,the phone comes with an adapter

DIY,not_removed,if your fridge is pulling more that amps on the line then yes you need bigger switches you might want to research the model and find out what is it supposed to be pulling as far as amperage is concerned
DIY,not_removed,well first the switch you linked to doesnt have a dc rating at all but since you said the ac side failed thats probably not your problem have you confirmed the fridge is still operating it sounds to me like it failed and took the switch with it which is another huge red flag since it should have burned a fuse or breaker before the switch failed
DIY,not_removed,did you save the old switches a spray of some electronic cleaner deoxit and cycling then several times might bring the switches back
DIY,not_removed,thanks for the reply the fridge was made in poland in the and probably originally from an rv before it was installed in my camper van in information on the appliance is not available according to my searches seems like a lot for a fridge buying a new fridge would probably get me a more energy efficient model but i think that will be my last resort as i would like to keep the integrity of the vintage look of my van the old switches were rated it might be possible i just had bad luck with bad switches or that in fact they poorly made and dont hold up to the rating i will have to see if i can get stronger switches
DIY,not_removed,the fridge was working on ac prior to replacing the switch it did not work on dc which i suspected was the switch and is the reason why i am replacing them
DIY,not_removed,it is amazing how such a small detail like this can change the whole space i have been wanting a ceiling like this for a long time but it just would not fit in any part of my house
DIY,not_removed,that looks great is that pine
DIY,not_removed,looks awesome looks like mine mine is from so its a classic look to say the least
DIY,not_removed,very clean and great colors i want a patio grill set up like that
DIY,not_removed,looks great huge improvement
DIY,not_removed,is that sold in the flooring department
DIY,not_removed,can i ask how much the project cost was i dont know much about the cost of lumber
DIY,not_removed,yes american knotty pine from home depot
DIY,not_removed,no its in lumber the backside of this is the bead boardwainscot design
DIY,not_removed,roughly for the materials per board for spar urethane sealant for stain
DIY,not_removed,is this for a show piece i wouldnt want to use a knife on that with a metal inlay

DIY,not_removed,httpiimgurcomtgtbmvrjpg is the evidence on my shame i am a design major industrial design at that so im pretty appalled at how noncircley these are but as long as they work i suppose its okay next time i know to practice with my new tool on scrap wood first

DIY,not_removed,wheres the table i like to envision people just sitting and staring at each other can i ask why you went with mulch youll have to redo you patio at least every year much better than dirt though
DIY,not_removed,how are those lights powered some pavers would be really nice if you ever get sick of the mulch
DIY,not_removed,table was at walmart in back order haha i went with mulch because if costlabor and i absolutely love the way it lookssmells redoing it every year is a pain in the rear but gets me an excuse to go outside and drink beer while breaking a sweat
DIY,not_removed,solar powered i was contemplating pavers this year but currently in the process of replacing the fence

DIY,not_removed,all i could thing was groot
DIY,not_removed,its not terribly pretty but the technique is correct looks like maybe unless you lost a finger somewhere then no this isnt how to
DIY,not_removed,forgot to mention it in the caption but wear a respirator when sanding the epoxy dont breathe that dust
DIY,not_removed,get a mic mixer the simplest ones are passive better ones are amplified
DIY,not_removed,i have eight players and its ambient sound in a house not looking for production quality just good enough to transcribe later
DIY,not_removed,how many players do you have what kind of budget are you looking at spending
DIY,not_removed,depending on the quality of the raw sound and the capabilities of your editing software postrecording compression with high gain may be an option with just one mic
DIY,not_removed,this post appears to be to the wrong subreddit perhaps you should post this to rsomethingimade rcrafts rhomeimprovement or some other more appropriate subreddit try posting to rfindareddit or searching the httpswwwredditcomsubreddits to find an appropriate subreddit your post has been removed see the httpswwwredditcomrdiywikiguidelines for more information if you believe this is a mistake please thank you
DIY,not_removed,so basically you want something with channels in it players you a good pickup would be for example a behringer xenyx it has inputs is powered amp and there is a usb version you can hook up any dynamic mic with either a jack into the channels or use adapters from a jack into the and then master output via usb to your computer something like that however has two channels per faderlevel adjust past channel so youd probably want to hook it up so that your two soft spoken players are on and independantly volume controlled and then the others are paired or both softies on the same channel line in and they can be volume boosted by the same amount
DIY,not_removed,the new obs studio i dont think that the op has the expertise and enough time to learn how to use that software
DIY,not_removed,take your comment karma somewhere else that sounds so rude and stupid and you are the one who simply recommending go take your misleading business elsewhere
DIY,not_removed,meh just stab it with a screwdriver edit or realistically a corkscrew will leave only a small hole
DIY,not_removed,if you arent bothered about destroying them what i suggest is using a hacksaw and chopping the ends off or drilling two holes in the middle of each and threading wire through to yank them out
DIY,not_removed,do you have access to the other side
DIY,not_removed,you want to lift from opposite sides at the same time putty knives should do the trick as you lift on one side only it puts more pressure on the other side instead you want to lift is straight out
DIY,not_removed,could you wrap wire around it and just keep twisting to pull the sides inward why do you need to remove these edit i ask because maybe we can solve the main problem a different way
DIY,not_removed,do you have one or even better two flat head screw drivers if you get one under the edge you can pry a little up at a time as you switch back and forth to opposite sides if you have two you can put one in the middle of opposite sides and pry evenly up and that should do it
DIY,not_removed,thanks for everyones help i ended up drilling into them i wanted to avoid damage but it was just not gonna happen even after drilling it was still extremely hard to remove them if i could fucking meet the motherfucker who designed this shit i would beat the living shit out of him i think im going to have to get some white fridge magnets and stick them on the base instead of these stupid plastic caps
DIY,not_removed,corkscrew good idea
DIY,not_removed,i do but the other side is just solid metal it has no entry or access to the inside
DIY,not_removed,i will try the putty knife trick im a bit afraid i might cut myself surprised i didnt already the other thing is the metal around the cap blocks the tools a bit as in the handle will eventually be blocked by the metal bar so you cant push it as much thats why i was hoping to find something that i can use to pull it out at a degree angle like a claw on a stick
DIY,not_removed,i tried wrapping wire but it didnt work it didnt pull the sides that much then i tried pulling the ends of the wire to pull it out didnt work i dont know what kind of moron designed this i have to pull them out because i have to disassemble the desk to move it and the nuts and bolts are behind the cap i dont have a workshop or a lot of tools so cant really do something super crafty
DIY,not_removed,what about lifting the leg is it hollow on the end where you could stick a long possibly curvedbent tool up and pry push at an angle from the inside
DIY,not_removed,hmmmmdo you have some credit card type cards library card shopper card something like that maybe you could shove a couple in there at a corner or opposing sides or both or all four and then ease it out that way or you could cut or drill a hole in it so you can get a finger in there to get it out or even just screw a screw into part way and use that to pull it out
DIY,not_removed,another option is to cut two opposite sides with a razor blade so you can fold them inward then maybe the other two side flaps can release not sure if that made sense
DIY,not_removed,am contractor yes always a good idea to have someone look you can remove the sheetrock on that dividing wall and maybe it will be obvious that you can pull it out i can hardly imagine a situation where that would he structural
DIY,not_removed,this may seem odd but it might be worth it to check dimensions before doing anything else measure the distance from the edges of the doors on the outside and then from edge of door to wall on each side if it turns out the difference is only its a single stud wall your next step should probably be to tear the drywall off your side to check the framing advice from a husband rather than a diyer disrupt her closet as little as possible if its wider the architects hid a utility run in there i mention this because we were going to put in a doorway to connect two bedrooms one was eventually going to be turned into a master bath instead of the expected messy business of cutting through old plaster and lath knocking out a couple of studs and sliding a prehung door into place a oneweekend job we found the walls were actually over apart and the space between a minefield of wiring steamheating pipes plumbing vents etc we also found at one end a builtin ladder that took us all the way down two floors to a hatch in the basement ceiling
DIY,not_removed,the only way to know for sure is to get the blueprints and see if it is load bearing edit im not a contractor or anything ive just seen the stories here on reddit where people messed up just do a search for load bearing
DIY,not_removed,you might need to rebuild the header above the door frames if it sags it probably wasnt built to span that length without the support
DIY,not_removed,its non load lifetime builder here if its just the interior wall you want out rip it but if what you want to do is remove the section of wall between the two sets of doors for a huge opening you will need to definitely rebuild a solid header spanning both openings hope it helped
DIY,not_removed,yup thats what im hoping to do this weekend or so can you let me know what i should look for im on a top floor of a floor condo
DIY,not_removed,ive done tons of research and figured its non load bearing but wanted additional thoughts and yeah i sawread too many horror stories and wanted to get more opinions
DIY,not_removed,yeah that was my thought process that and the fact that its just wide enough for a single stud and i really cant imagine someone wouldve designed a single stud to be load bearing i thought its a good idea to ask around
DIY,not_removed,ummmm if there are beams that end on the top of your wall thats a problem if you can wiggle the one or two in there and see that they are not jammed in under pressure thats a good sign kinda have to look at it though there are so many odd variations still id be real surprised if it were load bearing

DIY,not_removed,free got the log from a friend salvaged the lamp
DIY,not_removed,a pair of dice
DIY,not_removed,i took the idea from him but i only had a hand saw slabs is enough lol
DIY,not_removed,its decorative but nice attempt at a troll
DIY,not_removed,nice thats the way to do it haha
DIY,not_removed,nicely done thanks for showing taping work also thats a beautiful dog breed
DIY,not_removed,looks great thanks for sharing
DIY,not_removed,wonderful job
DIY,not_removed,thats great how about some climbing holds
DIY,not_removed,i saw the beginning of that and thought well thats going to be weird something about the straight lines and the taping after all was said and done though it looked really cute well done
DIY,not_removed,thanks he is a long haired german shepherd
DIY,not_removed,thanks i love gsds and the long haired ones are extra beautiful
DIY,not_removed,for a split second i thought it was a belgian shepherd groenendael but now i see that it is in fact a gsd good boy
DIY,not_removed,nice skull what kind of beer is your classy apparat serving
DIY,not_removed,badass this is totally the kind of tap id want in my house
DIY,not_removed,the british in india will be slaughtered then we will overrun the moslems and force their allah to bow to kali and then the hebrew god will fall and finally the christian god will be cast down and forgotten
DIY,not_removed,you should sell these or at least one of these to me
DIY,not_removed,that is metal cheers
DIY,not_removed,badass i love it
DIY,not_removed,amazuhzing
DIY,not_removed,thanks left side is an session ipa citra hops right side is same ipa but sat on mangos for a week
DIY,not_removed,wat
DIY,not_removed,its from indiana jones and the temple of doom return that upvote now
DIY,not_removed,neither will give you a discount for brand loyalty but both will give you discounts for large purchases both also offer programs for home renovators they will supply you with their credit card and you have no interest payments for the first six months then you get a relatively low interest rate i dont know about lowes but my local hd has what they call the bid room go to the commercial desk with an order of or more and they will come back with an offer to fill it at a minimum it is less but sometimes it is much higher i got off for all my plumbing all in all during my renovation i got an additional off the regular prices hey money talks left me a few dollars for the beer
DIY,not_removed,you can buy a lowes off coupon on ebay for like they are emailed almost instantly they are from the change of address form at the post office
DIY,not_removed,lowes typically has better finishings hd often has better prices on building materials tools just depend on your brand preferences i get bosch tools from lowes and milwaukee and makita tools from hd just depending on the reviews i read
DIY,not_removed,maybe its just me but i find the employees in my local lowes are always willing to spend time with me answer questions intelligently and give me good ideas i didnt even think of the employees in my local home depot are well hard to find the lowes website is genius in that you can buy on line and pick the item up in your store super timesaving
DIY,not_removed,one is orange the other is blue other than that they offer extremely similar pricing and services if they are close shop both to see which has the better deal or sale at the time on whatever items you are looking for
DIY,not_removed,lowers has coupons depot has prices ebay has tools plan your projects with price in mind and make sure you thank the store manager for whomever helps you
DIY,not_removed,if you are in the us the postal service gives a off coupon for lowes as part of change of address packet as stated little difference home depot has rentals by me i was on a first name basis with about employees if you are doing tile or a backsplash it is worth checking both to see what they offer
DIY,not_removed,if you are looking for standard stuff they are both the same i think lowes is a bit cheaper however hd has a bigger selection so if you need something more unique i find hd often has it while lowes does not hd is more geared towards contractors and lowes is about design imo
DIY,not_removed,it is always worth it to compare the two for stuff since they have all their things online sometimes one is having a crazy sale and the other isnt sometimes the item isnt your style

DIY,not_removed,if i were to make something like this i would do it from one solid piece of redwood burl but redwood is readily available here in humboldt county too
DIY,not_removed,so many salty comments here nice work op
DIY,not_removed,hey man i think its awesome coming from a fellow pourover lover i just wish it had a bit more clearance for larger cups but thats just my preference 😁 looks great otherwise does the meter go all the way through the wood or does the coffee actually flow through the wood
DIY,not_removed,why
DIY,not_removed,when did this start being called pour over its a filter like you get in europe that sits on a mug or a jug if you make lots like i do without a support at the bottom they go in a filter coffee machine that wooden box is just something else to clean
DIY,not_removed,seems like the acidity of the coffee would eat away at the finish and leech into the brew
DIY,not_removed,wow ive never seen someone need so many fancy tools for such a simple project also he could have used his palm sander by holding the wood in his hand i have done it many times
DIY,not_removed,that would be very cool i just happened to have this old redwood on hand and decided it might look cool
DIY,not_removed,hah thanks everyones a critic
DIY,not_removed,how much coffee do you drink i thought my water brew was pretty big the dimensions are really easy to scale so build it to fit whatever you want not sure about the meter guessing thats a typo the coffee wont touch the wood
DIY,not_removed,for brewing coffee
DIY,not_removed,i dont know like years ago its become extremely popular in the third wave coffee scene here in the us as we can see a cup being brewed freshly instead of having to trust hoursold drip machines
DIY,not_removed,the coffee should not touch the woodfinish there is plenty of clearance there are only three small holes in the center of the bottom of the pour over cone
DIY,not_removed,to be fair he didnt need those tools to make this he had them so he used them
DIY,not_removed,i use a oz starbucks mug so its not really practical for me but my wife would use it i do french press but she is a pour over type
DIY,not_removed,the pour over filter holder you have goes on the cup for pour over coffee the frame is entirely unnecessary
DIY,not_removed,its not really practical for me just make a taller one
DIY,not_removed,as i said in the video you can change the proportions of the piece very easily to accommodate other cups
DIY,not_removed,its mostly decorative although some other pour over cones do need this type of support
DIY,not_removed,i have mugs too large to support the filter holder but the frame seems mostly for aesthetics i like it regardless
DIY,not_removed,its beautiful but it seems a little redundant
DIY,not_removed,ugh i dont want say it but i am not to impressed by it dont kill me i like dove tails and hate metal fasteners
DIY,not_removed,its literally boards screwed together with a hole im also not impressed im also not impressed by naming this a pour over its god damn filter coffee
DIY,not_removed,im also not impressed who cares it wasnt posted here to impress you or anyone else the point of this subreddit is to teach people how to make things simple projects like this one are important for people who have few diy skills and not many tools its a simple useful project thats well within the reach of someone who wants to start making things your opinion of what its called is also irrelevant
DIY,not_removed,that was exactly my goal not every project needs to be crazy complex
DIY,not_removed,the issue is probably less the tool and more that you may be only hitting drywall make sure you are using long enough brads to go through trim drywall and sink a good distance into a stud and make sure your are hitting studs or the bottom plate i use a crown stapler note but have used bread or trim nailers in the past
DIY,not_removed,you are aiming for the bottom plate or the studs nothing will hold in just drywall
DIY,not_removed,nothing will hold in drywall you have to hit the stud there should be one every sixteen inches the brads will work if long enough ie the molding is inches drywall is inches so you would need at least inch to get a quarter inch penetration into the stud longer would be better
DIY,not_removed,thanks everybody
DIY,not_removed,yes long nails angled down to hit the base of the framed wall i add a few up high angled up to try and pinch the base board into the wall in spit it is bowed out studs are better of course then caulk

DIY,not_removed,youre going to want a metric fuckload of rubber isolators to keep the vibration from using your roof cavity as a resonator
DIY,not_removed,is there a particular reason you are planning on mounting on the roof the less holes you have in your roof in general the better vibration from that badboy will also shake through your entire house i would also recommend something of a larger gauge to support the mechanical equipment those little slotted angles are designed to hold things like garage door openers not rooftop equipment
DIY,not_removed,edit ill need a larger gauge because this particular one is not strong enough this is the slotted angle i was talking about
DIY,not_removed,and this is the closest thing i could find online that i imagined the project to turn out like httpwwwrelenergycomwpcontentgalleryroofinstallationsroofacinstallationsjpg
DIY,not_removed,im deaf so i dont think this will be a concern but yes i will look into adding rubber isolators
DIY,not_removed,wouldnt it be more efficient in a shady spot on the ground rather than in direct sunlight on the roof
DIY,not_removed,our backyard is small and the condenser was put smack in the middle of the yard once removed we can fit in a flower bed a bistro table a bench grill etc right now the ac is right there making it useless and ugly i want to renovate the backyard over the next four years so relocating the ac to the roof just above the backyard will make renovation a lot more feasible
DIY,not_removed,i installed ductwork through the roof for a kitchen ventilation hood above the stove no water dripping or seeping through since then this was september the whole roof is also relatively new under years old for a house thats years old

DIY,not_removed,take a gander at the garage door opener itself the thing attached to the ceiling in the garage and the garage door itself there are usually instructions there or hints as to what to search for online this isnt rocket surgery

DIY,not_removed,i think the problem with skateboards is their shape and standard clamps on them probably wont press them evenly enough you could probably make a jig with pieces that are skateboard shaped for top and bottom and then clamp on that with the skateboards in between good luck
DIY,not_removed,theres a company that recycles skateboards and makes them into guitars theyre called prisma guitars check em out
DIY,not_removed,what kind of jig could be hard enough to bend skateboard decks when sandwiched in between it
DIY,not_removed,that is what my link went to and where i got the idea from
DIY,not_removed,i dont think those guys bend the skateboard flat just need to press evenly enough to get the deck to glue well to each other i think what they end up with is essentially a footthick skateboard deck and work or down from there
DIY,not_removed,agree with this assessment one option would be to just clamp across the width of the board with a couple sets of clamps using cauls across the width then you dont have to jack around with the arc of the board probably would need quite a few clamps though or so another more permanent idea comes to mind maybe buy a couple of these or something like this as the recent reviews seem sketchy and set them on spacers to gives yourself some thickness capacity
DIY,not_removed,i belive he cuts off the nose and tail just beyond the bolts and then flattens the concave that goes side to side would your suggestion work for that
DIY,not_removed,yea i think if you were working on a flatter piece then it would just be easier to get a good surfacetosurface mating for the glue maybe try gluing one piece on at a time instead of a full stack and see how that goes first
DIY,not_removed,the lack of brakes makes me anxious
DIY,not_removed,i like it nice fabricating skills im jealous anybody interested in this concept without the welding skills check this out i got to ride one of these last week and its a sweet friggin setup for a pretty good price
DIY,not_removed,bravo i always wanted to make one of these but then i sold my welder and most of my tools and all of my bicycles and my huge garage and house and moved into an apartment in a new state thank you for letting me live vicariously through you
DIY,not_removed,id like to see that too how hard is it to get it going from a complete stop when it has full cargo and the rider
DIY,not_removed,looks just like a bakfiets httpwwwbakfietsnl
DIY,not_removed,great work i love how it looks like a hybrid with a boat that cuts through the air in terms of carrying load though how would this be better than a regular lightweight bike with a trailer attached
DIY,not_removed,noice
DIY,not_removed,welcome to portland oregon
DIY,not_removed,i think the only thing i would change about this would be to make it a trike must be really hard to keep stable with a load
DIY,not_removed,i have no idea about bikes and the whatnot but am truly curious what are the advantage of putting the cargo load in the front as opposed to behind in front of the rear tire
DIY,not_removed,wouldnt you want three wheels on something like this i imagine it can get a bit unwieldy when fully loaded and trying to make a turn
DIY,not_removed,looks like a fucking death trap
DIY,not_removed,i second this motion all in favor chime your bells
DIY,not_removed,
DIY,not_removed,the rear coaster is ok for now since this town is extremely flat with a high elevation of above sea level id like to put an electric front wheel with regenerative braking
DIY,not_removed,that is a really good point op should keep an eye out for an old tandem or moped to salvage the drum brakes or perhaps a cheap mountain bike for the discs
DIY,not_removed,wow that is such a neat idea thanks for sharing i dont see how the keel tube connects to the crankset housing pipe in the video but i like the forward headset pipe being through the keel tube that seems stronger than my truss design
DIY,not_removed,not op depends on the gearing but even are certainly noticeable and make routes with lots of stops very exhausting and annoying for safety reasons id be more concerned about stopping
DIY,not_removed,its not difficult on flat ground i cant find any hills nearby to see otherwise beating into a headwind with an umbrella for shade is quite the workout and it is a quite heavy bike
DIY,not_removed,i tried but i cant seem to get the leverage
DIY,not_removed,loved these in europe
DIY,not_removed,lots of manufacturers httpwwwlarryvsharrycom and many more
DIY,not_removed,well it cost about less im sure a trailer is more efficient but it doesnt look as cool so its not better just different
DIY,not_removed,youre off by about miles
DIY,not_removed,i might make a wheel version someday but the lean into turns is what makes it easy to ride
DIY,not_removed,for riding stability i have no idea ive seen those hurley long bikes that have the stretch in the rear but ive never loaded one up and ridden it as for building them i find that its simpler to build a long steering arm than route and suspend a long chain
DIY,not_removed,its much more stable cornering than a wheeler especial when loaded rear wheel trikes tend to be tippy and when loaded and the rider begins to lumber it can lift the drive wheel on the down stroke front wheel trikes have a much wider turning radius i think making a wheel version would be great for gardens and small farms ive not had reason to build one yet
DIY,not_removed,
DIY,not_removed,i guess properly mounting them will be the greatest problem
DIY,not_removed,theres a part that mounts to the bike permanently on the bottom bracket and then there is a thru axle that attaches to that for the easy onoff the version i got to ride was an earlier prototype so im not sure what the final product will look like it definitely seemed super strong though
DIY,not_removed,i did not know that other companies made them too very cool thanks
DIY,not_removed,ah ive seen trailers around here for ££ looked into them a few weeks ago as im thinking of getting a bike but could do with something for our dog to get in when shes knackered wouldnt look as nice though have you oiled that wood i reckon itd look even nicer with some oil to darken and protect the wood a bit id recommend osmo clear oil the colour is great and you only need two coats
DIY,not_removed,i should think theres a lot more inefficiency in using a trailer too extra wheels particularly small ones should add rolling resistance for a start
DIY,not_removed,cargo bikes are all over portland though i ride a longtail mostly because i dont have the money to buy a bakfiets or the skills to build one it gets no notice in portland though when ive taken out other places i get a lot of looks thats a cool build the box reminds me of a boat
DIY,not_removed,when the cargo space is up front you can get the load lower and it is more stable
DIY,not_removed,ah that makes sense for the building of it from your video it looks pretty east to steerride cheers
DIY,not_removed,that is seriously beauty in motion i honestly didnt think it would turn that easily so i have to ask where did you get the idea to do this
DIY,not_removed,you i like you p
DIY,not_removed,i used a clear water sealant on it im not too happy with the wood and will replace it when it wears out time will tell when that will be
DIY,not_removed,is portland flat it looks like it is a long way from the sea
DIY,not_removed,that is seriously beauty in motion thank you as for the idea origin i saw a photo of a but i didnt like the square box or the small front wheel so i adapted the design to fit the local environment
DIY,not_removed,there are some hills but its not nearly as hilly as say seattle or san francisco there are a few places with more daunting hills in the city core you can get away with a or speed bike without issue fixed gear bikes are popular in part because its possible to ride them most places to get to the coast theres a smaller mountain range and then there are the cascade mountains to the east bit thats definitely outside the city
DIY,not_removed,dutchman here its called a httpstranslategooglecomnlenbakfiets for the pronunciation click on the speaker icon in google translate literally translated a bakfiets would mean container bicycle and in the olden days they looked this is a bakers bakfiets for delivering bread and the like as you can see theyre monstrously heavy due to the solid construction so riding them wasnt easy there were many types of bakfiets in use in the netherlands in the first six decades of the century before cars and vans became commonplace later on became available as well
DIY,not_removed,my buddy had a bakfiet it was unbelievably smooth for such a big bike
DIY,not_removed,youre welcome
DIY,not_removed,portland is very hilly some parts hillyer than others sw portland is all hills steep ones se and ne not as bad portland is also the home of tall bikes and unicycles but only if youre wearing a darth vader mask and a kilt playing bagpipes

DIY,not_removed,why not supplies add up to less than usd
DIY,not_removed,httpswwwredditcomrdiywikiguidelines
DIY,not_removed,i prefer this method over the puck in the tank because the puck seems to corrode things in the tank the replacement cartridges are each so i wanted to find a cheaper way to use them i think the next one i modify i might try to make the bottom cap a lot easier to remove instead the reason for the slice in the side is so i can just pull the cartridge up and slip a new chlorine tab in there and be done rather than remove the cartridge turn it upside down and pry the cap off and then insert chlorine
DIY,not_removed,why would one need this
DIY,not_removed,if you live in an area with really bad water where you get hard to remove water stains in the bowls etc this simply drizzles bleach in the bowl every time you flush its a way to keep the bowl reasonably clean between proper cleanings
DIY,not_removed,thanks for the explanation
DIY,not_removed,never use a purchased weed barrier eventually they work their way up and look horrible layers of newspaper will work just about as good and if it works its way up it will either disintegrate right away or can clean it up easily eventually weeds will have enough to grow on top of what ever you use anyways so using nothing is a choice
DIY,not_removed,im in tx but i never use weed barrier under dg unless its specifically requested by a homeowner even then ill implore them to reconsider just make sure to compact the subsurface and then compact the dg really well and youll be fine

DIY,not_removed,why the hell would you use cinder blo woah are those ittybitty cinder blocks
DIY,not_removed,i lost it at the mini cinder blocks is this for part of a collection or model or just for fun
DIY,not_removed,what is this a table for ants
DIY,not_removed,that is great my wife wants me to build a table like that maybe i should make her the mini version
DIY,not_removed,i remember when this website took off and was just selling cinder blocks and i think pallets its nice to see they have expanded and found a cool niche i wonder if they will do scale stuff that seems more popular
DIY,not_removed,great looking table but how did you account for seasonal wood movement
DIY,not_removed,i feel like this table is too good to be used in a doll house where no child will appreciate it
DIY,not_removed,this is beautiful id been brainstorming all night how i was gonna do the legs on a table project and now im gonna steal yours edit just went past picture you genius bastard
DIY,not_removed,it doesnt look like you accounted for wood movement when you attached the base to the table top with a table that size youre looking at expansioncontraction of at least in over the course of the season your table is probably going to explode and kill your entire family rwoodworking
DIY,not_removed,if your into building models i reccomend this stuff dries faster than woodglue and it tacks so you dont have to hold your pieces together long before their solid
DIY,not_removed,uminimaterials im just taken back by your work holy heifers your cinder blocks are amazing looking at your products i can only imagine a tiny train city haha fantastic work
DIY,not_removed,wut
DIY,not_removed,i would have preferred it with a first tube
DIY,not_removed,but is it level
DIY,not_removed,dude wtf
DIY,not_removed,yep i make mini cinder blocks mainly
DIY,not_removed,just fun i make mini lumber and cinder blocks and make stuff
DIY,not_removed,we do have cinder blocks
DIY,not_removed,how far do you think itll move
DIY,not_removed,those look like concrete not cinder
DIY,not_removed,how far can you throw it
DIY,not_removed,maybe a
DIY,not_removed,yea theyre concrete its just an easy identifiable name most people wouldnt know what a cmu is
DIY,not_removed,avoid screwing into the endgrain of boards the end it looks like the two base pieces may be designed this way so all your screw should go through the magenta pieces into the yellow predrill these holes while clamped to avoid any splitting and put your screw in before you remove the clamp also tie all corners on the bottom together so you have a full square keeping the corners from moving at all
DIY,not_removed,both your design and the pictures are over kill lateral bracing the xs and the horizontal members are absolutely necessary but the amount used is redundant over engineered source im an engineer
DIY,not_removed,you have no diagonals on the sides id use same xtype design on the sides too otherwise itll easily collapse front or back unless the bottom is notably wider than the top two questions why do u want to build a tower who doesnt allow u to build one
DIY,not_removed,thanks for your reply i not planning on using screws but bolts actually coach bolts httpwwwtuincoukimagesdcoachboltjpg indeed predrilling is a wise thing i almost always do this when using screws on ends on on thicker planks although i now i some kind of screw with a red tip which prevents splitting still need to do a bit of experimenting with that tieing all four corners at the bottom makes sence ill add that to the design
DIY,not_removed,cheers in a new design i removed the top x mainly because i had to reserve about cm of space because it will go into the ground but good to know it wasnt needed either way
DIY,not_removed,you cant get in the chair with xs on the sides
DIY,not_removed,the local goverment you need a permit for that in the netherlands i could go through the whole process but i highly suspect there are many regulations regarding how to build an tower giving this whole project a more serious note with my lifeguard chair i can give it a try get a bit experience and maybe in the winter ill take a look at the whole legal process of building a tower i didnt do the x on the side mainly because it wasnt there on my inspiration photo but if it would become unstable i should be able to create a x on the inside or maybe just a diagonal
DIY,not_removed,thats fine just center the x bracing along the verticals ie put the x in the middle of the legs

DIY,not_removed,to busy joists i run on most pergolas i do are about apart by the time you have battened it and it looks like you have all the battens scarfed into the joists makes this very labour intensive
DIY,not_removed,you dont have a ledger board in place yet are you sure you know how to properly install one will this require a permit if you attach it to the house have you considered making it freestanding
DIY,not_removed,the biggest problem with your span isnt the capacity of the its that lumber isnt really readily available is probably about the longest pt lumber youll find available in stock thats not to say you cant get longer lengths ordered through a real lumber yard but the cost will go up considerably id put a third post in the center and solve both problems just use on the posts itll be much easier to notch for beams than a and wont look so spindly way way to many cross beams and purlins or inch spacing you cant reliably attach post bases to the patio blocks youll need to remove them in the area of the post and digpour real footings the blocks can be cut and replaced around the poured footings
DIY,not_removed,grow strawberries or grapes up there or any vine would be awesome
DIY,not_removed,ill try to be quick first you need to dig holes for post brackets set in concrete about across and deep need a center post span is too wide not to have one i would do this a little different on centersplenty close from the house out have a drop from house to headder this is for watershed measure this to be sure you still have headroom on the post header use flat across the top for fabric support centers also the stairs are the problem as simple as i can explain it you need head clearance on stairs at least on interior apps that is measured from the outside edge of the step upwards so basically your first trusses need to be headded off and leave it open over the stairsthis will change your layout altogether just double up the first truss directly above that areawill be the on coming inward from stair end now you run the ledger board on the house out to the stair edge cut it cut a truss to go from the ledger back to the doubled truss creating an l do the same on the other side of the stepsn ow you will need a short post here i would just surface mount a post anchor to that top step it should be sturdy enough my reason for the and sloping is they will be nailers for future solid roof material corrugated pvc comes in many shades and is cheap and durable sorry so long ask any questions you need
DIY,not_removed,are terrible they twist and bend horribly use or instead or you can make laminated posts and wrap them with more attractive material
DIY,not_removed,foundation foundation foundation your current wallpatio is not an appropriate base dig a hole to your frost depth and backfill with cement and post footing i hate installing ledger boards because your intentionally poking holes in your houses weather proofing its also a reason for permitting in some counties as opposed to independent structure id change the following to to or laminated
DIY,not_removed,i built something similar recently hopefully it gives you some more ideas as for shade consider passive design to allow sun in winter and shade in summer although it wont give you any rain cover i didnt take mine to the extent described in the attached link httpwwwyourhomegovaupassivedesignshading but you can see in the third pic the theoretical effect of the slats over the year using sketchup and google earth pics
DIY,not_removed,ok hard getting a sense of the crowding from just sketch up i was planning to look at neighbors porch tomorrow and measure the spacing of his setting them ft apart does reduce the work and cost
DIY,not_removed,free standing was a thought no ledger in place yet you can see an old ledger board attached by a previous owner that is still in place there was a badly built pergola of only pt wood when i moved in held together by nail plates and every hole had a nail it was ridiculous i removed the whole thing aside from the ledger board not sure on permits probably will and havent checked that yet
DIY,not_removed,the span isnt using pt the only pt is the post holding it up but i dont want it visible so i was going to wrap it option for the posts was seeing price of red cedar and notching them the span was planned on using red cedar but im worried its too long of a span seems generally others believe the same all the lumber will be from a real lumber yard this isnt a big box store project imo envisioning the crossbeams spacing in comparison to studs of a wall i can see theyre too close now i think i will lift all blocks and dig footings i couldnt imagine attaching to the blocks below was sufficient and ive got confirmation from others here im right thanks for the advice edit broke grammar rule
DIY,not_removed,wife would kill me might look nice but that would invite too many bugs to nest next to a wood house
DIY,not_removed,thats a pretty big footer i raised the height of the entire thing to give me clearance on the top step i prefer not putting in a cutout i still think the notched upright is better to keep the crossbeams spaced right plus aesthetic reasons corrugated pvc is not pleasing to look at if im building this out of red cedar i want it nice i really do appreciate the advice ill take any and all
DIY,not_removed,ill check prices of cedar and notch it might be more attractive as you say
DIY,not_removed,no frost depth as im aware this is coastal ca never gets colder than but a few times a year never snows permits due to attaching to house is something i havent checked yet im not opposed to just posts next to house is too large id rather third post it
DIY,not_removed,looks nice and large you use the area often thanks for the link good read the patio faces the setting sun so its plenty cool during most of the day i think id prefer to go shade cloth since it will block all the light and not allow small bits still through its only about hrs of afternoon sun that is the problem
DIY,not_removed,you want to keep the front as open as you can the less posts the better i cant work imperial metric but inch would span that doubled up how you have drawn it im sure
DIY,not_removed,youd probably still struggle to find untreated lumber that length without it becoming cost prohibitive although there is also some cost associated with adding a third post dealing with really long lumber is just a pain its hard to transport hard to maneuver around a job site its heavy etc
DIY,not_removed,i assumed pt pine cedar isnt nearly as bad in though generally larger boards are better in scale for appearance
DIY,not_removed,ive only just finished and being the middle of winter here let me get back to you in six months phase two will include a covered area attached behind the shed with an outdoor fire
DIY,not_removed,the pt here is doug fir i believe i dont know elsewhere in the country if other wood is used pt cased by cedar was just a cost cutting idea i might just go a solid cedar if cost difference isnt high
DIY,not_removed,thats a job that is best dug by hand i dont blame you for not wanting to do it but id hire someone to come dig it by hand or with their equipment and insurance before using a piece of rental equipment im not very familiar with that close to a building
DIY,not_removed,thanks for the responses i ended up calling a pro to come out and get me a quote not very diy but ill still be installing the drain myself and gutters and backfill
DIY,not_removed,traditional bobcat would suck hit up craigslist and find someone with a backhoe they can have that done in less than hours or hit up home depot where i am you can rent a mini excavator rental for for a day or for or a trencher for
DIY,not_removed,call before you dig not sure you have that where you are but httpalbertaonecallcom
DIY,not_removed,
DIY,not_removed,a plain old shovel one with a good lip and a strong and long handle i recommend fiskars shovels it is backbreaking but its the best and mostly only way to do it now you dont have to do the shoveling so the best rental is or dudes who enjoy manual labor and bucks for each of em
DIY,not_removed,the mini excavator would work ive used them in the past what id think is most useful would be a dingo think walk behind skid steer
DIY,not_removed,this one is pocket sized
DIY,not_removed,nothing wrong with hiring a bit of help
DIY,not_removed,in the us you just dial
DIY,not_removed,that is awesome i want one so bad my husband is the worlds biggest spider man fan so i cant wait to show him how amazing this is
DIY,not_removed,this is so cool i love reading the process giving me some ideas for a present for my bf thanks for sharing
DIY,not_removed,amazing work my brother and i used to make custom figures when we were kids they never turned out anywhere near this professional looking of course but i love the idea of making the figure you want when its otherwise unavailable
DIY,not_removed,wish i was in toronto id join your club
DIY,not_removed,far out man have you done any other ones i used to do the old assemble gi joes with other parts thing but never went this far
DIY,not_removed,when you make the casts for the custom pieces like the claws are you using an epoxy clay and then making silicone molds of them to cast resin replicas respectively here is a suggestion to help you with your written tutorials httpwwwwikihowcomimagessampledocsatooandtousagepdf
DIY,not_removed,what part is it leaking from
DIY,not_removed,cant tell from the pic is it leaking from the orange pex tube or the valve handle
DIY,not_removed,those valves are notorious for leaking over time you can shut the main stop off remove that valve make a clean cut on the pex orange tube and install a proper valve for that at the bottom of the faucet supply tube like this one
DIY,not_removed,best i can tell its at the blue handle
DIY,not_removed,the blue handle then running down the line
DIY,not_removed,definitely going to have to replace the valve its an easy job orange tube pushes in to the valve and is sealed by orings remove the old valve and connect the braided supply tube directly to the faucet remove the end of the supply tube at the angle stop and put this guy in there
DIY,not_removed,
DIY,not_removed,thanks
DIY,not_removed,and they are available on amazon prime
DIY,not_removed,it has two pieces of spring wire bent in a v shape doesnt it they are called torsion springs if so look up into the mechanism and see if you can find two small hooks or ears on either side this video shows what they might look like if your fan does not have that look for small slots cut into the side

DIY,not_removed,its dumb that this is being removed a poster gave me my answer and i did a fucking ton of googling its just goddamn hard when you dont know what parts are called and and the manufacturer doesnt make a comprehensive manual sometimes its nice to have a person who knows answer the question instead of being stuck in a google hell dumb
DIY,not_removed,your description sounds correct but the interior of that cylinder is really smooth heres a couple pictures there are those two small holes near the screws that look like youre supposed to insert something but the angle of the springs wont let you theres also the slot but i cant imagine that im supposed to slide the springs into the sides of the fan that would be so impractical youd have to remove the whole unit to do the most minor thing
DIY,not_removed,those two slots is what you are supposed to use clear the drywall out of them so that they are open the springs go into the slots honest
DIY,not_removed,oh thats kind of a bummer guess thats what i gotta do
DIY,not_removed,you may be able to slide a thin blade up through the slots and saw away at it as youve found sheetrock is pretty easy to cut
DIY,not_removed,yeah it rained down on me in surprising quantities
DIY,not_removed,honestly you can wrap wires around each screw but its not going to be rated for that and would not meet nec requirements the proper way is to pigtail the wires
DIY,not_removed,on the switches where there is a wire under the screw and directly into the back those will be your coming into the box then going out to the next device off the other side of each switch bottom is your switch legs you need to make the wires in the tops of each switch together the ones under the screws and also add pigtails to it you should end up with wires under one wire nut the pigtails will go to the top side of your new switches then just put the switch legs to the bottom of the switches as per the old switches
DIY,not_removed,you can always wrap the wire around the screw itself and tighten it but make sure its off at the breaker before you touch it
DIY,not_removed,you shouldnt put both wires under the same screw pigtail it with a marrette and call it a day
DIY,not_removed,yes you can i also wrap the posts with electrical tape
DIY,not_removed,yup it doesnt meet national electrical code but if it is something temporary maybe you can use do that
DIY,not_removed,i could never get away with skimping on the base like that because the ground freezes where i live if anyone is starting something like this putting landscape fabric down under the base will help prevent weeds from growing up through the patio looks good
DIY,not_removed,of base and of sand whats the point you should have just put it on dirt if you were gonna skimp like that
DIY,not_removed,lpt one step at a time lay the base first level the base pack the base then lay the sand then level the sand then pack the sand then lay the bricks dont do half of one thing before starting another it usually works out better looking in the end this way
DIY,not_removed,a quick review of time and cost pavers edging spikes paver base paver sand hand tamp wood total digging took about afternoons as the rain ruined some progress and we had to redo some actual time of laying the base edging sand and pavers was sunday afternoons about hours
DIY,not_removed,if anyone has questions on timing and budget i am more than happy to share but i feel that most people on here are way ahead of me diywise and you probably have an idea either way hope you enjoy the post
DIY,not_removed,now put a hot tub on it
DIY,not_removed,thats a great tip i was just thinking that i wish i had put some kind of fabric down as i was mowing the weeds on my gravel parking spot
DIY,not_removed,i live in the northeast the ground will definitely freeze on me however it is mostly clay underneath and i think i should be fine time will tell though
DIY,not_removed,can you if you wanted to go cheap
DIY,not_removed,do girls like hot tubs
DIY,not_removed,i would never recommend it it just wont last and will look terrible after only a couple years
DIY,not_removed,build a birdhouse for it
DIY,not_removed,why couldnt you attach it to the porch ceiling or to the top of the post near your rain gutter how many cameras you have you have a lot of crime in your neighborhood
DIY,not_removed,seems like you could get an acrylic plastic box of sorts to put the camera in think like the ones they put the room thermostats in at commercial buildings the open by key only ones the only problem with this is i have heard enclosing these ir cameras or using them through windows messes with the infra red light so it doesnt project out well good luck i would search home security websites and you tube there has to be an easy answer for ya
DIY,not_removed,how about a light fixture take the light workings out and put your camera inside it would be protected and not look out of place i also like the fake birdhouse idea from bobnb
DIY,not_removed,i would get something like that
DIY,not_removed,why couldnt you attach it to the porch ceiling or to the top of the post near your rain gutter how many cameras you have you have a lot of crime in your neighborhood tried that before i hung it but the angle wouldnt let it see into the backyard enough to see every access point of the house a few years ago we had some kids going around spray painting on fences and the sides of houses and also breaking into cars lived here for about years and only had problems that one year

DIY,not_removed,what do you mean by insulate
DIY,not_removed,well the first thing you should do is find a nice barren area of yard put the drum in the center and have a fire in it if it holds then you need only insulate the exterior enough that it doesnt immediately harm anything that touches it edit barren no plants or flammable material just to clarify then make it pretty if it doesnt hold up you know for the next old dryer you find that you need to figure out how to insulate the center
DIY,not_removed,you might want to check if there are any prohibitions or permits required for burning in your area
DIY,not_removed,fire bricks
DIY,not_removed,deleted
DIY,not_removed,family business is flooring and ive installed hardwood floors with and for my dad on and off for years for saws i like dewalt weve had the same dewalt miter saw see daily abuse for almost ten years youll need a table saw for sure and you can do all you cuts with one but also having a miter saw makes it so much easier faster and cleaner a small jig saw is handy too if you have to cut out around and non standard features like a stone fireplace or round columns delta is good quality too but more expensive nice thing about saws is that once you have one you can use it for all kinds of work for nailers and air tools bosch no questions asked youll need a specialty floor nailer that will cost a bit more but its necessary the install instructions for your wood should say what size nailer and nailsstaples to use if you do any other diy work on a regular basis a good air compressor and finish brad nailed will be super handy plus get an accessory kit and youll have the ability to blow dust off stuff pump up tires etc air compressors are handy to have in the garage i cant give you specific models off hand but read some amazon reviews and youll be able to find something realiable if dewalt and bosch are too expensive then home depots house brand ryobi is a good value buy for saws i havent really found cheap air tools that were good some other tools that are handy for installing wood floors pry bar tapping block to not mar the wood when installing rubber mallet vice grips to pull out nails that are misshot coping saw if a jig saw is unavailable flat head screw driver utility knife just some other wood installation tips make sure you put down aquabar between the underlayment and hardwood it acts as a moisture barrier if your not on a basement and also helps reduce squeaks as the floor settles in also make sure to acclimatize the wood for a few days in the house for it to get the temp and humidity you keep your house at start on the long wall and run the wood with the length of the room if you can itll look better and be easier to keep square snap square chalk lines across to reference for keeping the floor square save the boxes the wood comes in to protect the floor you already laid as your working thats all the big things i can think of and way more than asked about but i hope it helps

DIY,not_removed,i just bought a cheap miter saw i made the purchase knowing what issues id face with it one is accuracy im not doing fine woodworking every time i hit the trigger the torque makes it jump just a bit off the mark its due to the crap design of the adjustment release you can make it work by tweaking it a bit or just checking before you make your cut also the nailers for tongue and groove flooring can be rented id do that instead of buying just make sure the foot on the nailer doesnt have burrs or other damage a burr or other issue can cause damaage you might not notice until you look across the floor at the right angle and youve already laid or runs yea it happened to me once the saw will get used for everything later on so definitely buy range will be good enough
DIY,not_removed,i feel like a quick google search would be faster than posting to reddit
DIY,not_removed,weve had the same dewalt miter saw see daily abuse for almost ten years brands and tools change so dewalt is no more what it was years ago another example is makita that i dont trust anymore because it has became cheap stuff but retained the premium price well regarded is the bosch make sure you choose the professional line as well as the metabo i believe its superior but that is much more expensive if you are going to be easy with the power tools you could buy something cheaper like the ryobi just dont pretend and dont stress it too much
DIY,not_removed,thanks so much for taking the time to respond i may have some follow up questions for you once were in the thick of it i really appreciate your input we can use any help we can get
DIY,not_removed,yes thanks for the helpful advice ive been scouring the internet for the last several days just thought to hit up reddit for some firsthand feedback
DIY,not_removed,miter saws are miter saws thats the way they are unless you spent on one its going to be just as good as the rest of them and even then its still likely to be similar to the rest they arent made for accuracy of course you can make it really accurate if you want and they certainly arent made to last
DIY,not_removed,wow you must really suck at the internet because i found this in less than seconds httpwwwuptownfloorscomtoolsgeneralhtm
DIY,not_removed,its still likely to be similar to the rest where did you read this stuff its clear you never had any professional experience in the trade there are some brands they are good enough for people like you but for the professional stuff we said what are the brands
DIY,not_removed,youre right i dont have professional experience but that doesnt mean that im not around people who do everyone ive ever talked to about tools laughs when it comes to miter saws personally ive only ever used various dewalts and the bosch axial arm one ive seen a lot of them and there really isnt much of a difference in them i have yet to see the perfect miter saw they are really only made for trimmouldingflooringframing so why should the industry pop an amazing accurate well built made to last saw out
DIY,not_removed,i dont have professional experience and it wasnt and offense but youre just a kind of user different from professional users believe me dont ever suggest a ryobi or black and decker to a professional trade person because you would get a bad feedback let other people say this and that because they just need to show that they know but they never had any experience bosch milwakee metabo and a few others cost much more because there is a reason to other people who need to say bla bla bla give them a ryobi and similar stuff
DIY,not_removed,yeah im a little bit across the board with tools i have a ryobi drill thats beat to shit but still works great a ryobi circular saw that i hate makita impact driver that i love dewalt miter saw the cheapest whatever model that is pc air tools milwaukee recip saw and a few other smaller dewalt tools i usually end up getting whatever has a good reputation but also fits the budget i use my impact driver the most but other than that everything is fairly light use just doing stuff around the house but still didnt want crap tools but i can say as far as the features of miter saws not talking about the users they are all the same theres literally no difference in operation between my dewalt saw and the sliding dewalt with the fancy light that ive used only different uses like my is good for and smaller work trim work ect and the sliding is good for wide boards and shelvinglarge crown work still the same cut quality and overall build quality and yeah bosch has a good rep and the features on the axial arm one are nice like the adjustments in the front and the trigger lock and all that but still it is built with the same materials as the rest it still seems like a great saw i guess i just see it from a different perspective than do you but i hear what youre saying
DIY,not_removed,i have a ryobi makita dewalt milwakee woww so many tools and you dont run a trade and service business dewalt with the fancy light that is because manufacturers need to sell and in order to do that they do a market research and find out that people will like the fancy light because they dont have a professional working experience i also in the factory had to use a dewalt mitresaw which had a beautiful look like laser which i always disliked because im used to do the job without the need of these noob gadgets said that all tools are necessary because they will fit for the right person and the right budget

DIY,not_removed,spend the big bucks for a bottle of white nail polish dude
DIY,not_removed,office supply stores have white and color paint pens about bucks and lasts a long time i sometimes use tham for my leatherwork as well
DIY,not_removed,or use white out
DIY,not_removed,is that what it is any suggestions lol
DIY,not_removed,hmm thats a good idea too it should have that sheen to it
DIY,not_removed,yes hes being sarcastic on the big bucks of course white out or a paint pen is going to have a fairly thin paint in them nail polish is your best bet in my opinion
DIY,not_removed,white out is kind of flat i have used paint pens on the screws in remodeling
DIY,not_removed,im not a nail polish guy will any drug store nail polish do
DIY,not_removed,whats a paint pen as in where would i find one
DIY,not_removed,yes almost all drug stores carry a supply of cosmetics if you dont mind the wait amazon will also have it
DIY,not_removed,amazon or a craft store its kind of like a highlighter but instead of florescence they dispense paint
DIY,not_removed,nail polish is really handy stuff to have around its perfect for repairing deep scratches on your car if you want to prevent rust for example a close color match is a bonus
DIY,not_removed,lowes willshould have them also michaels or art stores heck wal mart probably has them
DIY,not_removed,its possible if the wall is not load bearing but why would you want to go to all that trouble i would either use some sort of wiremold type of surface conduit or simply build some sort of wainscoting or maybe a chair rail or some sort of baseboard molding around the bottom of the wall and hide it in there
DIY,not_removed,another possibility would be crownduit its a crown molding made to run wires through they used it on this old house and it looked good
DIY,not_removed,i would think your best plan would be to just find a way to do surface mount conduit or plastic channels httpwwwcabletiesandmorecomimageshingedracewayshingedoverviewjpg but there are lots of ways to camoflauge them or decorate them so they seem more artistic rather than functional httpsistackimgurcometzlcpng you could try to make the channel part of the design of the room or you could just go with a very industrial look and leave them all exposed as is a good electrician can bend conduit amazingly well without having to chisel away any plaster so i would find a guy who is very experienced at that it is as much an art as a science so spend the money and let an expert impress you with his skills
DIY,not_removed,is there an attic space above the ceilings you could do all the conduit runs above and drop down with surface mount wire moulding the other option is running below in the basementfloor framing and install infloor mounted boxes like thesehttpwwwlewelectriccom
DIY,not_removed,why dont you just run the wires in the walls without the channels you normaly only put channels in the wall so that you can add cables afterwards but if you open the walls just put the cables in and plaster over them
DIY,not_removed,ah my apologies i missed a detail the inside corners all have a curve to them about radius ive updated the imgur album with of what happened when the previous owners hacked ° corner conduit into the curves that makes me think that wainscoting chair rails crown molding things like that which would have been nice and simple are not good options for me thanks for the reply though
DIY,not_removed,thanks for the reply unfortunately i should have mentioned that the interior corners are all curved meaning i think molding chair rails etc wouldnt work for me more details in
DIY,not_removed,wow thanks so much for all the ideas in our region of spain theres a very traditional manufacturer called fontini who make fabriccovered cabling and porcelain fittings which are meant to be on show httpsalmacenelectricidadesimgcmsmecanismosfontinicablejpg definitely planning on using that in some places but i dont think its practical to wire a full modern room with it i think of all the options wellbent conduit – probably run low down less visible – is my favourite thanks again i appreciate it
DIY,not_removed,great idea i have not investigated exactly whats above the ceiling yet – i will there is an attic room upstairs which currently has a rough tiled floor we were thinking about replacing that anyway so perhaps we could kill two birds with one stone and hopefully not myself at the same time
DIY,not_removed,depending on your local electrical code or well in this part of the eu anyway you cant run a cable inside a structure that might damage it when dragged or when left in place be exposed to such as on stone work where children and animals might have access to it etc nor can it be run inside the insulation
DIY,not_removed,oh interesting i had assumed conduit was necessary i guess the downsides would be if something goes wrong with a particular or junction id have to open up the wall to fix if we wanted to add new cabling in the future wed have to open up the wall is there anything else i should consider as a potential downside to this also interested whether you would keep the junctions mounted on the wall and just run the individual cables under the plaster thanks for the advice
DIY,not_removed,you dont have many good options plus that wall is so thin to begin with that i think it would make it unacceptably weak to hack a mm deep channel into it is there a possibility of running things under the floor or above the ceiling
DIY,not_removed,you can flex wiremold either by heating it or buying preradiused corners
DIY,not_removed,yeah i think you would not only kill yourself trying to chisel into those thin walls but you would probably punch holes all the way through the walls and mess them up in a bunch of places it would be a nightmare
DIY,not_removed,very traditional indeed especially that cabling there is ultra illegal to do any where in eu these days no color code and especially no pipe for those single insulation wires and twisted like that together though caveat is that if that is according to code at the time it was done it can be fixed as is
DIY,not_removed,you shouldnt do what this person suggested you would need to put wire in conduit if you put it in a channel and plaster it i would also use rigid conduit and not the flex conduit that you posted im lost places that type of conduit wouldnt be able to be used for residential wiring except in certain circumstances i think if you were channeling out this brick to run conduit then you should cut out sections for the junction box your wall seems very thin though and id make sure you wont mess up the structure trying this i think there are better options out there for you that would run the wire on the surface of the wall
DIY,not_removed,just make sure youre cables are rated to go in the wall for junctions and outlets you put such a box in and a lid over it which you can remove for access i dont know what its called in english but its unterputzdose under plaster box in german nothing should go wrong with your cable in the wall pretty much all cables aber plastered in the wall in germany if youre putting new cables in just put enough in if you have the possibility add empty channels to your wall but they arent necessary in my house theres one empty channel from every room to the distribution board they are all empty so far but i will put ethernet cables in shortly one possible downside is that you have to be carefull if you nail anything to the wall if they arent deep in it but lay them in the wall like this so you know aproximately where they are
DIY,not_removed,with walls that thin you require conduit mostly to prevent damaging wire when later hanging a painting and not knowing where the wire went you or more likely the next owner in the us we very often run bare wire through walls but thats in the center of standard walls so you dont hit the wire when hanging something with a screw later ah standard dimensions suck wish we went metric those are some damn thin walls you have they are for sure not loadbearing walls if theyre only brick in the middle those curves in the corners do give it another fun element as well this is really going to work best if you have access to under the floor or above the ceiling where you can run some romex lines back to your box then the solution is going to be cutting a channel down from the ceiling all the way through the wall just use a circular saw with a masonry blade cut your channel all the down to where you want your outlet replace the brick part with your conduit hook everything up you may or may not able to find interior outlet boxes that will be lowprofile enough for the actual outlets might have to use some metal ones that protrude a bit then plaster both sides back up and sand to level basically youre doing vertical channels for every box where the conduit replaces the brick wall center dont do horizontal will not be stable especially if you are using lowprofile outlet boxes or light switches do all your connections to the home run wire up in the ceiling in a covered box if youre going through the floor just replace down with up for everything in there and repair those corners they look cool rounded good luck
DIY,not_removed,what i would do is use some and plywood to make a coffered ceiling tray ceiling ceiling beams crown molldings andor fake pillars to get the lines across long distances then use chair rails andor baseboards to run the lines to specific spots or you can run it under the floor but it doesnt look like an option here with old houses that doesnt have thicker hollow walls this is pretty much your only option if you dont want visible wires
DIY,not_removed,i did not know that – amazing thanks for the tip ill take a look measure up the curves more carefully and see if theres a match
DIY,not_removed,a lot of those retro manufacturers are using modern color coded cable and then just putting a fabric sleeve over that so although it looks retro and feels like the original type of wiring from the it actually meets all modern codes
DIY,not_removed,its standard practice to plaster the cables in the walls
DIY,not_removed,getting access to either above the ceiling or under the floor is really the only way this or any wiring inside the walls will work otherwise i say do rigid conduit on top of the plaster for an industrial look ive seen that in old houses and it looks pretty cool
DIY,not_removed,dont do horizontal will not be stable oh man im glad you said this i could just imagine myself circular sawing along the base of a whole wall only for it to drop on my head this is a fantastic set of tips and ideas thanks so much for your input definitely going to check what the deal is with the ceiling but even if its not viable a curved conduit running round the room horizontally combined with hidden down pipes like you describe could be a great approach
DIY,not_removed,i got the impression that hes trying to preserve the look of the original plaster walls with their curved corners i think exposed conduit will be the only way to go building an entire false ceiling would be nice but probably insanely expensive
DIY,not_removed,sounds like i need to find someone who can tell me if running cables directly in the walls would be up to code in catalunya thanks for the ideas
DIY,not_removed,i suppose i am only talking about this side of the ocean b specifically says you cannot put bare romex in a shallow channel in brick and cover it in plaster you could protect it but it would be easier to use metal sheathed cable or just do the conduit
DIY,not_removed,tray ceilings and coffered ceilings are dirt cheap to do if you do it yourself you can use either plywood or more expensive i built a coffered ceiling in a room for under and i used finger jointed primed with prefinished mouldings if you do a tray ceiling it would cost even less and easier to do you just need to know what youre doing youre not replacing the ceiling youre just adding some parts to give it the look then smooth every out trim putty caulk and paint
DIY,not_removed,ujimthesoundman is right that id like to preserve the curves if possible – theyre present throughout the house ceiling beams would be lower impact but in my case id either need them crisscross the room or still have those pesky inside curved corners to figure out
DIY,not_removed,i work on electric guitars but i dont build pickups so i should be able to at least answer assuming you build the pickup correctly there is no necessary wiring except to connect both ends to the female jack for passive pickups all the extra stuff you see is also passive and only modifiesattenuates the signal coming straight off the pickup adding switches or pots between the pickup and the jack can be done just like guitars the sleeve of the jack is your local ground and everything should be grounded to it sometimes singlecoil pickups will buzz and youll have to connect any metal parts of the instrument to ground as well a volume pot or acts as a voltage divider to send some or all of the hot side of the pickup to ground when turned down as for your other questions have you looked at stewmac they appear to have parts and kits for building your own pickups and they seem to sell bobbins that have cutouts for either pole pieces or a blade and space to wrap the wire around though theyre shaped and spaced for electric guitar it should give you some idea httpwwwstewmaccompickupsandelectronicspickupkitsandparts
DIY,not_removed,thats great info about the wiring especially the grounding thank you and thanks as well for the link that will definitely save a good amount of searching

DIY,not_removed,looks like a moderator agreed its a little heavy on the advertising side and less on how to replicatebuild it
DIY,not_removed,why not test for yourself using a small mdf scrap piece likely result is a permanent ring and eventually minor swelling if you want to keep the surface wood colored looking seal it with a polyurethane or stain it then polyurethane you can also paint it
DIY,not_removed,it could start growing mold over time so i wouldnt let it go for too long get a coaster

DIY,not_removed,the little switch locks the deadbolt open so it doesnt lock you out when the door closes that style of deadbolt has a self latching catch
DIY,not_removed,you need to move that small button before you can turn the lock
DIY,not_removed,yes likely those are spring loaded so when locked open you really just need to push the switch to the other position and the latch springs out shouldnt even need to turn it
DIY,not_removed,yeah those locks are super old if i remember you hold them down to unlock

DIY,not_removed,ahaha i imagine that wouldnt be much work i dont paint them if i sell them so yours would just be a ball with a threaded hole p
DIY,not_removed,duskball idk what it does but apparently theres more than great ultra master and safari balls now
DIY,not_removed,
DIY,not_removed,thanks
DIY,not_removed,the lathe jaws are only barely able to hold the ball and id be afraid of chipping something the ball is bade of a resin and it is slightly brittle even hand tapping it almost always chips the entrance of the hole i started the tap with the lathe to get it straight but then did the rest by hand
DIY,not_removed,i added that its a cue ball and the machine is a lathe but short of writing an essay i cant see what more details one could want
DIY,not_removed,oh jeez i see that now thank you
DIY,not_removed,o
DIY,not_removed,thats what i was getting at it seemed odd that youd choose to center everything on a lathe and then risk having offcenter mounting threads by tapping by hand
DIY,not_removed,yes i did the very very start on the lathe for centering but as you can see a considerable amount of force was needed to drive the tap and the ball would have either slipped in the lathe or cracked if id tightened the jaws so it wouldnt slip

DIY,not_removed,this sub is about asking for help with how to do diy project general tool recommendations should probably be asked in rtools thanks
DIY,not_removed,well they are likely different diameters table saws are usually diameter could be up to though circular saws are typically but can be or a bunch of other diameters miter saws are usually or you need to make sure the arbor size the hole diameter is right but for wood saws it is usually you need to know what tooth count he wants higher tooth counts produce a finer finish but cut slower but other than that generally wood saw blades that are say with a arbor will work for any wood saw that needs that size blade
DIY,not_removed,you need to know the diameter of the blade the size of the arbor hole mounting hole in center and the tooth count of the blade most handheld circular saw blades use the same arbor and diameter although some battery operated ones are different table saw blades are usually or inches and the arbor size varies the tooth count is relevant to what type of material is being cut and the quality of finish low tooth counts cut fast but leave rough finishes with more tear out this is fine for cutting but not when you are cutting finish wood that is going to be visible the tooth count you may be able to read off the old blade otherwise mark the first tooth with a sharpie and rotate and count you dont have to be exact if you take the model numbers of the equipment and post them here or bring them with you to a good store they can help you select the correct blade also what you described for the last one doesnt sound like a miter saw might need a picture of that one

DIY,not_removed,he does a lot of carpentry so wood blades are what id get him we were working on a project well he was working i was holding a light and his miter saw didnt have any blades and he ended up using something else that didnt do as good a job to cut out the hole he wanted
DIY,not_removed,it has straight narrow blades for cutting a hole in a solid board

DIY,not_removed,go here httpduplicolorcomvideo watch some videos these guys are the experts
DIY,not_removed,not for sure on this unit but it seems like it is low on freon you cannot addcheck this your self you will need to call a cert tech out it may also be the capacitor for the fan
DIY,not_removed,did they check the refrigerant charge a low refrigerant level can cause the compressor to short cycle cutting out on low pressure
DIY,not_removed,i dont know if this is common but for my house my ac is able to be deactivated by the power company in times of high energy usage i get a bonus at the end of the year for being part of the program for the first summer i lived here i though something was wrong with my ac because it would randomly cycle on and off i could opt out if i wanted but once i found out about it i decided to stay anyway if you had someone look at it and they couldnt find anything wrong check to see if you might have an arrangement like this with the power company
DIY,not_removed,if should have an anti cycle board on it the inside thermistat should also anti cycle sounds like you need to have a hvac person come check it out and fix the wiring problem
DIY,not_removed,had this happen to me twice before once it was just the condenser cycling that was a capacitor issue in the other instance the blower would also stop that turned out to be a clog in the condensation drain the slow drain would occasionally back up to the overflow sensor and stop the system until it drained down blew it out with an air compressor and it started working normally
DIY,not_removed,they checked charging while they were here and it was fine
DIY,not_removed,this need to see working pressures with gauges
DIY,not_removed,they checked it no issues with it
DIY,not_removed,no agreement at all happens at all times of the day not just during peak usage
DIY,not_removed,that would probably start adding up pretty fast id rather let this limp along and get a whole new setup if this lasts the summer
DIY,not_removed,hey thats a great idea going to blow that a out now
DIY,not_removed,well ive blown it out wife said about a quarter cup of water came out the drain pipe ends in a u presumably to keep things from trying to crawl up it
DIY,not_removed,i didnt see the gauges myself but if the refrigerant was low i dont see why they wouldnt have added it and charged me
DIY,not_removed,with it cycling like that its not limping its slamming the compressor and it will lock up eventually this is why they have a short cycle timer built in you can add them if you are handy all it does it set a timer to prevent it from cycling causing the compressor to lock up
DIY,not_removed,really just step in diagnoses for high and low pressure cutoff switches then probably checking for power in places and see whats causing the motor to cut out i dont know specifics about house hold ac
DIY,not_removed,great learning and diy to get traffic
DIY,not_removed,yup go w the homax stuff but ive found that the small bottles waterbased i believe spray much more evenly than the large bottles and are far easier to use and adjust the large bottles tend to spray at a higher pressure and are often runny small bottles are the way to go
DIY,not_removed,thank you both for the suggestions but the pattern i have doesnt appear to be producible by a sprayed method seems like a thin layered was rolled on followed by a sponge or something depressed into the mud to create the pattern
DIY,not_removed,install a through wall split system

DIY,not_removed,lots of auto winder options from the previous post other options include things like using one of the generator builds to be powered off your walking stride sky is the limit
DIY,not_removed,you could get a hoop house with a fine mesh to stretch over the top like a greenhouse at a nursery but not glassplexiglass i know people that raise birds pheasants doves they use these for pens
DIY,not_removed,have you ever seen a picture of sandys tree dome
DIY,not_removed,i dont know why i expected anything less from reddit gg
DIY,not_removed,put him in one of those hamster balls
DIY,not_removed,you could use an old rabbit hutch and just take a few panels out so its on grass or similar with a chicken coop type of layout theyre premade so you would only have to attach them to your out house thingy
DIY,not_removed,i have the same concerns we have a lot of hawks and there have now been two instances i know of a neighbor dog being approached by hawks mine is still too small and its too cold for walks in the neighborhood or playing in the back yard but that time will come soon id be interested in finding out what you do im thinking of simply a fenced in area with a fence roof im also thinking of a pergola type area on our deck
DIY,not_removed,have you considered a mossberg the pump action may be a little difficult due to the lack of thumbs
DIY,not_removed,hey thats a great idea i will look into this may be able to just bury some pvc in the ground then stick some pipe in there and bend it up that would give me a decent frame for the pupper run
DIY,not_removed,thermocouple
DIY,not_removed,if you have a voltmeter you can test the thermocouple disconnect it put your voltmeter across the open end and you should have about milli volts with the pilot on it
DIY,not_removed,if it were just the thermocouple i would think you should still hear the gas and be able to light the pilot i would double check the gas supply itself
DIY,not_removed,run it past a wire brush
DIY,not_removed,ive got a couple of gas fireplaces sometimes when i light the pilot lights for the first time in the fall they wont stay lit i take a small strip of sandpaper and sand the thermocouple a bit and its good to go it doesnt take much
DIY,not_removed,pilot should still light with bad thermocouple but will go out when you release the ignition button either no gas at valve need to bleed gas line longer pilot gas line is sooted up very common if unit has not been serviced failed gas valve
DIY,not_removed,clean the burner compartment really well and replace the thermocouple they are cheap enough to try that first half of the time water heaters i go on are so dirty they cant get air so they choke out it is very rarely a gas valve
DIY,not_removed,if its an older furnace gas valve its possible that you turned the knob just enough that it isnt quite in the pilot position when you tried to light it the first time does it go all the way down when you press down on the knob the thermocouple wont keep gas from flowing while youre pushing the button it doesnt mean the thermocouple is good but you have to get the flame to light to know if it needs replacing
DIY,not_removed,yes it does depress at first its normal both a hiss and flame but then the flame slowly dies then depressing it does not produce either update i replaced the thermocouple it didnt seem to make any difference
DIY,not_removed,wellif i were still in the acheat business id probably be replacing the gas valve right now thats an odd problem but gas valves usually arent considered serviceable even though its not that hard to take them apart to see how they work putting them back together without any gas leaks is the real issue there you didnt really say whether this was a furnace water heater fire log or something else gas water heater thermostats are a little more complicated you dont want a water leak either but oldstyle furnace gas valves are an easy job if you know what youre doing if you dont know what youre doing you can burn your house down or blow it up if you use propane its even easier to ignite than natural gas and takes less of it to explode if you dont know what youre doing hire a professional or at least recruit a friend who really doesand remember its your house thats going to blow up if she doesnt
DIY,not_removed,oh sorry i thought i mentioned but yes you are right that i forgot to define it this is a space heater that im talking about also yes i draw the line at the thermocouple i will be calling in a pro from this point forward

DIY,not_removed,that dispenser is worth more than anything you would put in it
DIY,not_removed,alcohol sanitizes it hahahahhaha
DIY,not_removed,ughhh why the fuck would you do that to perfectly good scotch the nozzle is placed so that the first dram every time will be marinating in copper disgusting
DIY,not_removed,i was thinking the same thing that and im not sure why but everything about storing alcohol in galvanized seems wrong to me
DIY,not_removed,also to the scotch lover the subtle notes of flavour are to be savored this would offend a scotsman
DIY,not_removed,though ive never tried that particular blend its only glenlivet so its not much of a loss
DIY,not_removed,allscotchisbeautiful
DIY,not_removed,turn it into a sourdough starter split it up between family members and it will last in some form indefinitely
DIY,not_removed,freeze it mix a clear part resin and polish the crap out of it though inviting the family over and finish baking it for the family and have a little wake for her might be a great goodbye

DIY,not_removed,that is just really cool
DIY,not_removed,looks like it came out perfectly i assume youve done this before if you dont mind me asking how long did the whole project end up taking and how much did you spend as a side note how many frogs could you house in there i dont know anything about frogs
DIY,not_removed,i read the title as dog fart o
DIY,not_removed,i read dog fart vivarium thats not at all what this is and im glad very nice place you created for the little buggers
DIY,not_removed,i misread dart frog as dog fart and feel like i should apologize
DIY,not_removed,thats really cool but i read your title as dog fart vivarium which is on me but it got me to look anyway
DIY,not_removed,where is the frog
DIY,not_removed,well done hoping to get back into dart frogs when my son is a bit older so for now projects like these have to suffice
DIY,not_removed,leca beans are even cheaper if you buy them from hardware store nice habitat in any case
DIY,not_removed,really neat ive always wanted to have a riparium tank kinda like that does the cork and bark attached to the wall rot eventually or is that not an issue
DIY,not_removed,nice leucs and viv of course
DIY,not_removed,looks like it came out perfectly i assume youve done this before thanks i havent actually done this before the first tank i had the frogs in was a gallon and i didnt make any background i did a lot of reading and based my plan on guides like this one if you dont mind me asking how long did the whole project end up taking and how much did you spend time painting day black silicone day days to fully dry cork spray foam day days to fully dry coconut husk day days to fully dry cleanup base setup day total days start to finish but only of those days including actual work cost terrarium cork coconut mopani clay balls thermostat heater total about as a side note how many frogs could you house in there i dont know anything about frogs i could probably comfortably fit another two frogs in there im planning to get a couple more soon
DIY,not_removed,there are two in the first photo you can see one in the middle log and one on the bottomright peeking his head out from under the mopani wood
DIY,not_removed,cork doesnt really rot which is why most people use it for backgrounds like this httpwwwcorklinkcomindexphptheamazingnaturalpropertiesofcork

DIY,not_removed,for accurate measurements this may help
DIY,not_removed,go to a craft store ac moore or blick and look around maybe a combination of foam and foam board ive been on that bridge lovely
DIY,not_removed,given the model is available why not print it it gives you a solid base to work from and you can always finish the surface with more detail if you want printers are pretty easily accessible nowadays check if your local libraryuniversity has one if not check if theres a makerspace or other group workshop nearby
DIY,not_removed,you should adjust the leveling so its all running to the drain do not drill holes in the gutters the whole point of gutters is to funnel water away from the foundation of your house to a controlled outlet
DIY,not_removed,moving would be the easiest
DIY,not_removed,if you cant adjust the levels then a hole would work as a temporary fix its better to overflow on the outside than on to the wall an overflow pipe would be better to send the water a little further away however you do it do it quickly overflowing gutters can cause a lot of damage

DIY,not_removed,will the whole gutter need to be adjusted or just that one end do you think
DIY,not_removed,i have become super ocd about gutters holding water since they are relatively new and because i think my old gutters overflow rotted the wood they were connected to and i would like to avoid that at all costs i will try to readjust it and see how it goes
DIY,not_removed,you have a low spot in your gutters the water sits in the low spot solution remove the screws spikes nails from the gutter directly above the low spot and lift that section until its at least level with the rest of the gutter reinstall the screws this will displace the water and unless the installer was very incompetent should cause the water to drain into the nearest downspout source my father owns a gutter installation company edit please dont drill a hole in your guttering
DIY,not_removed,you wont be able to soak and scrape that so id try getting between the texture and the plaster or less likely sheetrock you have that open end to start at with your scraper if it doesnt come off easy take it all down to the studs and replace with sheetrock i actually like that texture over knockdown orange peel and certainly popcorn but if the goal is flat it either comes off easy or us easier to replace
DIY,not_removed,that is what i was thinking it seems way too thick they only put it in one room so only about sqft i figured tearing down and replacing might be the best option
DIY,not_removed,yeah it looks painted no way to spray with water and scrape away might as well save your shoulder and take down the ceiling and replace with sheet rock
DIY,not_removed,this appeared over the two days we were away at christmas it doesnt feel wet
DIY,not_removed,get an adhesive or vent clip magnetic mount one with adhesive wont damage the surface schosch magic mount is what i use the suction ones fucking suck dude

DIY,not_removed,link to more images and goodies ive had issues with using the pucks you throw in the tank they corrode the flappers and cause little leaks im sure there are bleach resistant flappers but i like a little diy these things deposit the bleach directly into the bowl and leave the water in the tank untouched but the cartridges are each locally so i did this mod to be able to use the far cheaper pool tabs

DIY,not_removed,ive heard you can mix paints with textile medium to make them appropriate for fabrics
DIY,not_removed,check with rcrafts
DIY,not_removed,what ive done in the past that works fairly well is mixing parts acrylic paint with part water making a stencil and spongebrushing it on dont overly saturate the brush or itll bleed past the stencil
DIY,not_removed,you could use regular fabric paint if you water it down a little it will soak in better and not crack may need two coats of paint though

DIY,not_removed,im looking for a marker based solution since it will be easier to draw what i want than to paint google says the oil may seep through to the other side but im not worried about that so i might buy a small one test it in a pocket and see how i like it
DIY,not_removed,too lazy for words but nice why not pvc pipe and plumbing fixtures no silly silicone needed that way
DIY,not_removed,like the setup and ingenuity my only concern would be the gutter material not being light proof i have built a few hydro setups indoors and made the mistake of not making sure one was light proof and ended up with a big algae problem in my tubes i wasnt doing nft though which dries a little in between floods i hope it works well for you
DIY,not_removed,you can spread silicone with your fingers but you need top keep a cup with water where you dip your fingers in before touching the silicone thats the trick edit absolutely add soap to the water forgot to mention that thanks to udaddyrappin
DIY,not_removed,this is how all diy articles should be written especially in magazines and on tv
DIY,not_removed,reddits fuckin shit yo
DIY,not_removed,dont buy a truck source i have a truck
DIY,not_removed,donkey kong
DIY,not_removed,im always interested to see how people do hydro setups because ive seen people fuck it up a million times best of luck to you
DIY,not_removed,why so negative about your work and everything you described you did a good job dont beat yourself up about it
DIY,not_removed,outside hydro that is a very nice setup with the mat on the bottom everything else elevated you should not need worry about insects you can grow a beautiful organic garden with that baby well done keep us updated please
DIY,not_removed,well fuck me made the mistake of showing this to the old lady guess ive fuckered myself into having to build one hopefully the fact that it freezes here indiana will be enough to nix this project from her list rant looks good man would love to see how it turns out
DIY,not_removed,seeing that you are in houston you are right water temp may be your most important factor you should look into buy nutrients from morgan seed in mizzou and a bag of and a decent ph kit and you sir are ready to roll
DIY,not_removed,but why why not a garden in the dirt
DIY,not_removed,i was like why did he hook it to his ac unit nice job
DIY,not_removed,i couldnt give shits about gardening but damn that was fun to read
DIY,not_removed,good job paying the dog tax at the end there
DIY,not_removed,fyi op wet your finger before you smooth silicone with it much easier
DIY,not_removed,nice job op whilst i can already see youve dug your reservoir into the ground when my dad and i made a hydro system we had another reservoir above the height of the plants so you just pump the water up into the res and it gravity feeds down through your system via variable rate tap this way you only need your pump on long enough to fill your top res we used an power socket timer and just timed how long it took to fill the res then run the timer at whatever intervals you want food for thought
DIY,not_removed,houston is so humid hook up your condenser to the top of your system and your ac run off with water your garden
DIY,not_removed,very nice job a couple of words from my experiences using hydroponics systems for uh herbs roots grow like you would not credit they will do their damndest to grow down your outfall and up the inlet youll generally need access to these to clean the roots out and stop the system flooding over also see if you can get a small inline filter aquarium style one should be fine so much algae crap grows in the nitrated water its unreal and get a bubbler an air pump connected to somethign like a pumice stone or diffuser to put in your water tank to keep the water oxygenated itll help loads with the general well being of your plants inthe long run
DIY,not_removed,i want to do something similar
DIY,not_removed,sweet setup is this the same thing as aquaponics or are there no fish in the tank this set up looks like maybe it could work either way
DIY,not_removed,why isnt the water pipe at the top
DIY,not_removed,why not bury the drainfeed pipes rid yourself of the trippinghazard i would think gravity would get the water back into the reservoir even if it came in a little low no
DIY,not_removed,i like the gasparilla reference
DIY,not_removed,crackplants
DIY,not_removed,thats awesome looks very japanese my mother did a similar outdoor setup a few years ago to grow herbs but a nosey neighbor called the cops and the hoa to report my sweet old mother was growing dope in her back yard hoa made her take it down
DIY,not_removed,do you play on only grown lettuces
DIY,not_removed,i like your fost
DIY,not_removed,looks great and nice st
DIY,not_removed,i couldnt tell from the photos but did you redirect your ac drain into that reservoir if not i suggest you do because free water
DIY,not_removed,thoroughly enjoyed your explanation of the pictures a little humor goes a long way for first time projects
DIY,not_removed,nice i enjoy experimentingbuilding home hydro systems myself since this appears to be your first home hydro system a couple of tips watch the reservoir fill level when i started my first outdoor system with a gallon reservoir i only needed to fill every weeks as the plants exploded in size i needed to refill every days the correct recommended way to do things is to dump the reservoir to clear excess nutrients i cheated and was simply adding new water with the correct amount of nutrients for that amount of water leading to excess nutrient build up i started then adding water only without nutrients and was able to go two months before my plants showed any signs of nutrient deficiency you should be using nutrient mixes that are designed for hydroponics and not soil watch out for chewing by that dog in your pic my systems uses more of the black tubing rather than pvc and some of our foster dogs have periodically created their own water park rather than the pvc pipes you used for the ramp to ramp connection it may have been cheapereasier to use some of the downspout flex tubing
DIY,not_removed,if you want to save mad cash on silicone sealant hot glue
DIY,not_removed,all right im lazy and dont want to look this stuff up so you have a reservoir of water buried thats being pumped to the top of the gutters feeding the plants so you have to add nutrients to that water i assume the bubbles are for keeping the nutrients evenly distributed
DIY,not_removed,so maybe im dumb but i never really knew what hydroponics actually was despite hearing the term often enough i had no clue you could grow veggies in water instead of dirt cool project op
DIY,not_removed,for the silicon use a wet cloth to wipe it off periodically as you as working make sure to deep the cloth damp as you go it makes life less bleh and more yay
DIY,not_removed,kudos that puppy is sweet
DIY,not_removed,omfg the commentary why arent all diy articles written like this seriously with these descriptions and your pics i dont feel so daunted to try it out myself safety goggles will be worn lol
DIY,not_removed,nice st i have a tuxedo black i gotta be honest i dont know anything about hydroponic gardening it looks pretty neat though what are the advantagesdisadvantages for this setup i could use a new project
DIY,not_removed,its called shade cloth not uv block fabric thats why no one you called carried it because everyone carries that loweshd as well
DIY,not_removed,like your st fun cars
DIY,not_removed,gutters have flat bottoms and a larger cross section than most pipe which is good for hydroponics
DIY,not_removed,op is cheapskate
DIY,not_removed,i agree op should paint all exposed white pvc black if not algae and autotrophic bacteria will most likely find the piping a perfect growth medium
DIY,not_removed,dad taught me to use dishwashing soap lasts longer on your fingers
DIY,not_removed,or saliva spit is always handy
DIY,not_removed,actually the trick is to spend on a box of rubber surgical gloves
DIY,not_removed,ky jelly works too
DIY,not_removed,hes running the water to a cooler on the ac pad if he buried it he would need a pump i think im just some dumb ass on the internet
DIY,not_removed,its a defense mechanism also its funny self deprecating humor is generally well received if he makes fun of or criticizes himself it prevents people from thinking hes taking this seriously and therefore they wont be critical but what do i know im just an idiot
DIY,not_removed,yes itll be interesting to follow up on this and you did a great job on both the construction and the commentary
DIY,not_removed,hey indiana isnt that bad im lying you could always drain the tank in the winter like you drain everything else for winter time i was debating this but i already have a yard for the garden
DIY,not_removed,build it indoors
DIY,not_removed,dirt is so last year
DIY,not_removed,much higher yield per plant much much higher yield per square foot of garden with a vertical garden like this far fewer problems with bugs and disease ability to tweak the nutrients plus the ph and temperature of the feed to suit the plants needs at any given time depending on setup automatic watering and lower consumption of water no weeding faster growth
DIY,not_removed,why not
DIY,not_removed,water comes out of the evaporator inside your blower duct not the condenser right
DIY,not_removed,oxygenated or
DIY,not_removed,pic he mentions using a bubbler
DIY,not_removed,theres no water coming off of the outdoor unit it only comes off of the condenser inside the furnace
DIY,not_removed,then why not use gutters instead of downspouts i know the tops are open but ive just seen so many built with or pvc and will eventually do it myself
DIY,not_removed,can confirm op is a cheapskate source i used to live with him
DIY,not_removed,id paint it white wont black will cook the plants
DIY,not_removed,confirm last longer than water and smoother slidefinish on face of silicone
DIY,not_removed,relevant username
DIY,not_removed,as long as the last gutter piece that is feeding into the pipe is higher than the top level of the reservoir it will have enough pressure to push regardless of what height it enters the tank at you could make it come into the bottom even if your flow rates are really high it could cause a little bit of a backup but should still work
DIY,not_removed,
DIY,not_removed,spiders are only an issue if youre afraid of them ants it depends some wont really cause any issues others could start farming aphids keep an eye on them and see how it goes
DIY,not_removed,just get some diatomaceous earth and spread it around get food grade so you can eat it if you really want or if your dog does it causes insects to dehydrate
DIY,not_removed,how horrible was digging for you
DIY,not_removed,really i have about a garden in my backyard i rototill it at the beginning of the year and its maintenance free except watering until the end of the summer
DIY,not_removed,why not not because this is a lot of work compared to having a regular garden
DIY,not_removed,the witty selfdeprecating picture captions are the shining star of a reddit degree
DIY,not_removed,well it just needs to be as high as the top of the setup no real maintenance closed res the same size as your bottom one in the ground could be half the size also but just run the pump again to fill it after it drains depends how much throughput youre after
DIY,not_removed,your ac compressor drips water out of your house already its about a of the work you already put into it plus its free automatic watering
DIY,not_removed,dude i have no idea what that thing is called tube that comes out of my house that drips water garden under it works great something with you to see him sure im in houston so humid and hazy runs seven
DIY,not_removed,ive got tube it drips i put plants under it works great
DIY,not_removed,oxygenated you have to pump pure pressurized or from a chemical reaction in order to get any decent amount of in at least thats how it is for planted aquariums
DIY,not_removed,i just switched to fish in my system i started with the fertilizers and the plants took off and then died i knew i wouldnt keep up with checking ppm levels and ph and everything else that goes along with it i figure nature has been doing it with fish and natural light for quite a while it just might work in my driveway sure you have to feed the fish everyday but it seems easier on the surface anyway
DIY,not_removed,best of luck if you get bored check out raquaponics im by all means no expert on it but ive been following that sub for a while and have seen a few similarly configured setups to this one there
DIY,not_removed,youll have much luck with the lettuces leafy greens and certain herbs but more substantive veggies like eggplants squashes tomatoes etc could struggle in such a small system okra is definitely a nogo smaller peppers may have enough room though but hey a few pots with some healthy soilcompost and some plant food you got yourself a wellrounded garden with minimal upkeep best of luck and happy planting
DIY,not_removed,of course silly me my drain just happens to run out right next to the condenser but thats not a universal design
DIY,not_removed,i have had various systems my first system was a hydrofarm megagarden it had a seven gallon reservoir if i recall its instructions it said to drain between fills so i used a wet vac to drain it between every fill and dumped the nutrient water out on my yard plants i then started getting lazy and mostly adding water rather than a full drain each time i really didnt see much difference with the plants it may have been suggesting the full drain given the relatively small size of the reservoir my second system went from indoors with the gallon reservoir to outdoors with a gallon reservoir because of the way i set it up draining the reservoir with a wet vac required too many cycles of the wet vac and i was too lazy to do it thus the nutrient build up until i started not adding nutrients with every water fill i have tried various plants and most did extremely well the tigger melons and one of the eggplants were not very tasty but i do not know if that was my nutrient mix or the particular type of plants i had problems with some insects that i am forgetting the name of they are particularly attracted to sugar snap peas and some people suggested keeping sugar snaps in the system to act as sacrificial bait i enjoy the building of the systems and initial experiments more than the long term maintenance of the plants so have to admit i do not always harvestgrow appropriately
DIY,not_removed,ive measure the stuff from big box stores
DIY,not_removed,open tops would mean a lot more evaporation plus light getting to the water pipe works just fine if you use thick enough nothing at all wrong with it im just giving some reasons to use a rectangular array and like the other guy said it is a lot cheaper if i was him i would have rigged up some bulkhead fittings for the pvctogutter though
DIY,not_removed,two farms for the price of one seems like a winwin to me
DIY,not_removed,it doesnt dehydrate them it shreds them to pieces if you look at de under a magnifying glass youll start to see why looks like a ton of razor blades sticking out everywhere
DIY,not_removed,dont bother with food gradeaquarium grade its too expensive and you rinse it off anyways before you eat also get a blower for distributing dusts and use that wet your plants and dust once a week and after ever major rain event only takes a few seconds to be honest you dont need nor want to coat the stuff
DIY,not_removed,the difference being that this is a lot of first time setup but once its running its much less work then a normal garden
DIY,not_removed,this seems like infinitely less work in the long run over a regular garden with the added bonus of still having a yard in a large city he has enough space here for plants in the space a traditional garden would have maybe if youre lucky
DIY,not_removed,what hes documented here is the initial creation of the garden where there wasnt one before its the equivalent to tearing up a large area of lawn digging out a ton of soil picking out roots and bug larvae adding in compost and topsoil then finally planting out the things you want to grow compared to that its much much less work and the ongoing maintenance with hydro is lower than with a traditional garden
DIY,not_removed,so why do you need oxygen in the water do the roots need oxygen
DIY,not_removed,do you use tilapia and do you eat a lot of fish
DIY,not_removed,i think the issue is that the pipe does not block enough light a layer of paint black or white will add additional lightblock to prevent algae
DIY,not_removed,im not sure if youre joking aphid farming ants can decimate plants and can be very hard to control if not caught early
DIY,not_removed,thats what i thought i initially put it was like razor wire for insects but then looked it up to make sure and seen wiki mention it dehydrates them
DIY,not_removed,from my limited understanding yes the roots need oxygen
DIY,not_removed,i have goldfish only right now mine is just small scale i have places for plants on irigation and another thrity dwc on top of the tub twenty five gallons ten goldfish at the moment three weeks into the project
DIY,not_removed,id get the okra in a large enough pot to support the root systemweight of the plant theyre beautiful one of my absolute favorites but they can get quite large a mature okra plant in our fields last summer stood with a stalk base about inches thick but its so delicious may try some cukes in the hydro system and some in a pot see how they compare keep us updated
DIY,not_removed,so layers of black and enough layers of white to cover the black up
DIY,not_removed,thanks will have to go and understand the details de has always been interesting to me
DIY,not_removed,okay cool didnt know that thanks
DIY,not_removed,the surface is retangular why not use silver duck tape blocks the light preventing algae buildup and also addresses heat issue
DIY,not_removed,light can also kill roots

DIY,not_removed,did you use a plate compactor
DIY,not_removed,im not a contractor or anything just a dude who made a paver patio i would just add some more gravel to the softer areas and keep packing until its even with the rest of it even if you would have had your pavers on top of it though i dont know what you plan on doing for the grout lines for the stone the area would have likely gotten wet in the rain anyway the point of the gravel is drainage and thats where the water likely would have drained to on its own pavers installed or not id pack it in until you cant pack any more otherwise you might need to figure out another way for the base to drain water if youre that worried perhaps someone else will chime in with more experience
DIY,not_removed,yes i would dig hole in certain areas because it was too soft
DIY,not_removed,this let dry a few days and compact and fill until level is reached in a way its a good thing this happened this way you are shown the areas beforehand that you would have had sinking problems in the future with good luck
DIY,not_removed,ive heard of using ubolts to create support points like
DIY,not_removed,thats genius i will have to look into this
DIY,not_removed,my sister just bought this table its not my style but i gotta say you really nailed the imitation throw the dark stain they use on it and i could probably swap it without her knowing the difference
DIY,not_removed,nice job well done
DIY,not_removed,how did you break down the pallets thats one of the parts i always struggle with looks great btw
DIY,not_removed,wow looks amazing sounds very heavy though where did you find good quality pallets
DIY,not_removed,nicely done not my style but a job well done one of the things i would suggest going forward is focusing on square not level if the floor in the garage isnt level it may appear to be good but wobble when you put it in the kitchen something ive struggled with in the past
DIY,not_removed,that looks awesome good job
DIY,not_removed,really beautiful way to go
DIY,not_removed,one really has to be careful of the pallets previous lives could be full of toxinspreservatives just a thought
DIY,not_removed,thank you
DIY,not_removed,i used a finish paste wax to seal it it has to be reapplied regularly
DIY,not_removed,i used a skill saw to cut the left and right sides free and then i only had to pry the slats free from the middle support i then hammer out any remaining nails
DIY,not_removed,i have a friend who works in shipping they would snag me pallets as they started breaking i aged them with a vinegar and tea stain
DIY,not_removed,i chose only untreated pine pallets
DIY,not_removed,is this still a concern if the final product is sealed
DIY,not_removed,excellent a very cool table
DIY,not_removed,its still a concern even if the wood is sealed you can achieve the same look by using scrap material and aging and stressing the wood

DIY,not_removed,right heading over to rhomeimprovement with it
DIY,not_removed,spdt single pole double throw common in low voltage circuits uncommonly referred to as such in residential electrical however you should be able to use a switch to achieve the same result connect hot to the common terminal and power will go to of the traveller outputs depending on switch position
DIY,not_removed,thats what single pole double throw does active goes in to the switch and then to either the flood or the leds neutral from each device is handled as usual pole is a technical term and dual pole would mean something else in this context a single pole switch switches one independent source a double throw gives it two destinations you would use double pole double throw if you were switching both active and neutral each time but for this you would leave neutral permanently wired for each device and just switch the active
DIY,not_removed,this is the type of switch where you have a switch at each end of a room and each can turn the light on and off it has a common and two connections for each position of the switch
DIY,not_removed,i dont believe ive seen a single pole single throw switch that has a common bus connection to each side but technically if you could find one i dont see why it wouldnt work
DIY,not_removed,three way switch is the way to go for sure easily available and would accomplish the task with standard equipment
DIY,not_removed,get some wood glue and some wood toothpicks or matchsticks coat a toothpick or matchstick in wood glue shove it in the screw hole repeat until the hole is full of toothpicks when the glue is dry break off the portion of the sticks that protrude from the hole screw the hinge back on video
DIY,not_removed,if the holes are too big for tooth picks use golf tees the wooden ones and glue this is an age old way to fill and reuse stripped holes because it works perfectly glue and fill the holes wait to dry and trim fillers flush with frame mark and pre drill small pilot holes then re screw the doors on
DIY,not_removed,you can drill it out and glue in a length of dowel this works better than tooth picks
DIY,not_removed,ive had good luck with glue and tooth picks as described by others here however epoxy putty would be another option fill the holes and once set up you can redrill the pilot hole for the screw
DIY,not_removed,ive done this with my guitar and the strap locks i could go rapelling with it now
DIY,not_removed,i apologize i edited my post i had the same toothpick idea but i am concerned it wont be secure enough for a heavy oak door and those spring loaded hinges or am i just a worry wart
DIY,not_removed,if you use glue and really jam them in it will work just fine just do it
DIY,not_removed,just jam in as many toothpicks as possible and lightly hammer them in no problem
DIY,not_removed,thank you
DIY,not_removed,the white powder is borax we had a problem with bugs that like moisture which is why im wondering if i should fill the holes in the wall

DIY,not_removed,why not just copy the design of most old gym equipment and do a pulley to a weight stack
DIY,not_removed,the springs wont be strong enough this is correct theres no real way to make this work without adding or upgrading springs unless you can figure out a way to lift the blades out of the water on the forward stroke another possibility might be to make the blades curved so that when you make the back stroke the blades are curved against the direction they spin in the water providing heavy resistance and when you release the pulling force the cable retractor then might be able to pull the blades as well since they will have less resistance due to the curvature however it might just make the retraction slow and not provide a realistic rowing experience
DIY,not_removed,you need a one way clutch or ratchet device to let the mechanism retract easily while still transmitting force from the pull
DIY,not_removed,you could use a freewheel bike hub the bit that lets you stop pedaling
DIY,not_removed,just throwing this out there a used rear bike hub would be perfect for this ratchets one way and you could even use a rear derailleur to change resistance by changing gears the main thing it lacks is a spring to draw the chain back and i dont know how it would interface with your source of resistance ps if you do this go for a threaded freewheel hub and not a freehub the former is easier to service and cheaper
DIY,not_removed,if you want to clicketyclickety ratchet sound consider using a sprag clutch you can pick em up on amazon for bucks or so
DIY,not_removed,if i understand correctly you want lots of resistance when pulling and then you want the string to autoretract try a oneway bearing combined with a directional brake that only activates during the pulling action then add a power spring to retract the cord its basically a fancy salad spinner or an adjustable drag fishing reel
DIY,not_removed,i could but im working in rather specific space requirements and the weight stack thing doesnt really work i dont have room to build all of that also the design i have would be really cool to pull off
DIY,not_removed,thanks for the reply im the time since i posted this i actually think i got it figured out i am currently building a rachet system that will allow the cable to pull the oars then pulled in but will not pull the oars when retracting thanks for the other suggestion though
DIY,not_removed,yup thats what i ended up building its kind of shitty atm but i am hoping to print one in the future to improve the project
DIY,not_removed,thats actually a great idea
DIY,not_removed,thanks these are all great ideas i ended up building a racheting gear out of wood but it will need to be replaced with something better in the future
DIY,not_removed,thanks the rope doesnt actually generate any resistance it is just connected to that separate machine the issue is that the rope cant retract under resistance
DIY,not_removed,you could use a cheap bicycle rear hub as they have one inside

DIY,not_removed,high gloss is typically easier to keep clean

DIY,not_removed,drilldriver combo tool bits for said tool hammer laser level tape measure pliers wrench step stool we just bought a house less than a year ago those are all the tools ive commonly used so far
DIY,not_removed,the best advise i can give is to only buy tools as you need them when you have a project around the house add the necessary tools to the budget for that project keep the tools you buy maintained and organized and in what seems like no time youll have a decent tool collection speaking from experience if you just go out and buy tool you think youll someday need you end up wasting money on tools youll never use
DIY,not_removed,thank you that makes sense i will be sure to add that to my list
DIY,not_removed,that is a good point does that mean there is nothing that would be needed urgently if something happens
DIY,not_removed,some basics you could get hammer screwdriver set pliers crescent wrench set socket wrench set and a cordless drilldriver beyond id just buy tools as you need them
DIY,not_removed,remove one of the hinge pins put it on the garage floor and whack it in the middle with a hammer this should make it fit tighter in the hinge and keep the door from swinging open
DIY,not_removed,they have a hinge mount door stop you can use we had a similar situation and this fixed it
DIY,not_removed,install a floor door stop and moutn it as close or as far from the wall as you want
DIY,not_removed,i have a that keeps the door closed but open enough for clearance for a rack behind the door i think its about long you could probably add a few inches of depth to it at installation
DIY,not_removed,
DIY,not_removed,by a closer for comercial doors super easy to install might look a bit much in a house but it will give you what you desire they run about or so
DIY,not_removed,an eye screw a foot away from the hinge on the upper door and another on the wall a small clock weight and cable ran though the wall eye connected to the doors gravity would hold it open
DIY,not_removed,if the door is sitting half way open then your lower hinges might be a little off try checking the door jamb with a level httpwwwacmehowtocomdnwdoorsdooropenphp
DIY,not_removed,hammer out the hinge pins and reinstall them but slide one or more of those bread ties in with it
DIY,not_removed,thanks saltinpepper i see what youre saying increase the friction within a hinge
DIY,not_removed,yeah a hinge pin door stop i love devices named after what they are might have to get a longer set screw and a jam nut for good measure
DIY,not_removed,thanks i have one it keeps the door from banging into the towel rack but i doesnt keep the door from drifting toward closed
DIY,not_removed,thanks ive seen some that would work floor mount but im reluctant to drill holes in my brand new tile floor
DIY,not_removed,thanks phantonphallus good idea but my wife would kill me if i put that in our new bathroom
DIY,not_removed,thank you i thought it might be something like that i will grab my level and check it this afternoon
DIY,not_removed,dont overbend it
DIY,not_removed,i have it on the door and wall it doesnt have to go on the floor
DIY,not_removed,i know manufacturers make hinges with a spring inside it but theyre usually for closing a cabinet or gate it will have a smallish torsion spring in place of one of the joints might be worth looking into heres an example of one
DIY,not_removed,well thats exactly what it is problem is if you shim the bottom hinge to fix that problem the door might start making contact with the door jamb which is even more annoying depends on how much of a gap you have between the door jamb and door
DIY,not_removed,agreed but the door has to stop from the wall and the wall is tile too my wife would kill me if i drilled holes in the brand new tiles
DIY,not_removed,thanks good idea i googled for a product but havent found it yet
DIY,not_removed,man is anyone in this thread actually reading your original post try what the first dude suggested about hammering the pin thats actually pretty interesting if that doesnt work just get new hinges if that doesnt work then im all out of ideas
DIY,not_removed,yep hammer the pin is the answer my wife put a throw rug under the door and that increased friction just enough so im not in a rush
DIY,not_removed,run a few dowel rods through each book leg just in case if the glue ever separates for whatever reason itll prevent the books from spinning or twisting use wood base and top mount the dowel rods in that with the books sandwiched in between
DIY,not_removed,stack like they do cakes with dowels or rebar depending on how sturdy you want it or how heavy

DIY,not_removed,editam is right on the money when building any structure that is weight supporting you should always plan for the worst and hope for the best having a metal frame will insure that this table will be around for decades to come
DIY,not_removed,do not try to remove vinyl it will be a pandoras box you do not want to open simply lay concrete board mesh the seams and thin set tile down easiest most practical way
DIY,not_removed,concrete board offset the seams and make sure the trowel matches the recommended size for the tile if there are the longer tiles offset by not the longer narrow tiles have a tendency to be twisted over the full length they are not fun to lay
DIY,not_removed,look into the snapstone tile it might cost a little more but i think you can slap it down right over the vinyl with no cement board
DIY,not_removed,i think your first step for sure is to find out what your subfloor is for example i am in florida and its all concrete slab here if you have slab i would definately remove everything down to the slab and then considder some ditra schluter type isolation layer i did not go that route and rather put my tiles directly on the slab with thinset my slab is years old and had no settling cracks so i knew i was good to go but you might be different in a much newer house if its a wood sub floor you should definitely take someone elses advice cause i only know about the cement slab concepts
DIY,not_removed,remove the vinyl and then apply something like red guard uncoupling mat as the base under the tile they will recommend a certain subfloor thickness before you start but if your house is new it may be fine already the uncoupling mat will help prevent cracking and provide a solid foundation for the tiling very easy to use i installed it under my bathroom tile directly into subfloor
DIY,not_removed,whats the sub floor how is the vinyl laid glued or not
DIY,not_removed,if the subfloor is a particleboard floor i would suggest a cement based underlay i wouldnt worry about a mesh use a rubber based adhesive and a correct trowel use a notched trowel
DIY,not_removed,generally agree with this removing vinyl is hell and once you start you have to finish only reservation here would be the kitchen and clearance for the dishwasher removing the vinyl wont save you much headroom but measure to make sure that vinyl hardiebacker thinset tile will allow you enough room to get dishwasher back in
DIY,not_removed,only additional note you should wet set your backer board
DIY,not_removed,the tile we are going with is i have read that some of the longer ones are a real pain
DIY,not_removed,i know ours isnt concrete as we have a basement level
DIY,not_removed,the red guard uncoupling mat is actual what i meant in the post when i said mesh the name of it had escaped my mind so thats what i was talking about ive read good things about it and from a lot of the advice and recommendations ive seen it does say this stuff works well its just kind of a bummer that its so expensive my wife and i priced that stuff at home depot and it is literally with of the price of all the tile we would need too
DIY,not_removed,ok we are unsure of what the subfloor is as of now but when we go to purchase the tile ill probably rip some of the carpet up to take a look i was wondering about the mesh stuff it sounds all and well but when we priced everything out the tile and the mesh were going to be pretty similar in price
DIY,not_removed,damn completely forgot this for the op newbie mistake made by an old timer thanks for the add on this is why a sub like this is such a good thing for the noobs none of us are perfect
DIY,not_removed,yeah fortunately my wife thought of that part too we also wondered about height difference between the rooms since the diningkitchen are vinyl and the living room is carpet i assume that if we leave the vinyl and just go over it well have slightly different floor heights
DIY,not_removed,i just did a whole kitchen with these i would never tell someone to not do a project but even guys that do a lot of tile work fuck this up it is really difficult to get everything level and have your seams match up because of individual tiles varying slightly in shape
DIY,not_removed,you can always get a contractor in to give you a free quotation then you can see what he would use not a nice thing to do but it saves you time and headache
DIY,not_removed,dont listen to anyone telling you do not worry about a mesh follow the product installation procedure ie if using hardie backer cbu mesh tape all seams with thinset if you care about not ending up with cracked tiles
DIY,not_removed,greetings i tried to make an understated interpretation of a classic english bridle briefcase mistakes i made i decided not to make a raised handle but holding it now after some time i wish i did i would prefer wider straps these are bit thin for the size of the construction i stitched too far from the edge on the gussets build process is commented and if you have any questions i am ready to help thank you for looking

DIY,not_removed,get a seam ripper and cut and pull the threads out you can find cheap ones at walmart or any store that deals in sewing or even use a small pocket knife then rub and massage the cloth a little to work out the old thread holes is the shirt discolored at all or been washed a lot since that area has never seen daylight or the washer it might be darker than the rest of the shirt
DIY,not_removed,that pocket is godawful and should never have been there in the first place it appears to be a fairly coarse weave at least in on the decorative elements this works in your favor as it will help to hide any hole left behind by the pocket stitching if youre not worried about screwing up the shirt go for it get yourself a or even just a hobby knife and cut the threads worst case scenario you end up with a shirt you only wear around the house

DIY,not_removed,tommen is that you
DIY,not_removed,excuse me d
DIY,not_removed,its a very considerate and touching present
DIY,not_removed,looks like something recovered from some forgotten dungeon in a musty old castle nicely done i do agree with ulasercond though a painted harry potter logo or perhaps better yet a burned or engraved would have really taken it over the top
DIY,not_removed,real or fake chests dont matter to me
DIY,not_removed,nice work but why is there a place pixelated fire in the fireplace
DIY,not_removed,nice gift only missing the painted harry potter logo on it which she may or may not want who knows could try to sketch and paint it by hand though
DIY,not_removed,very nice did you glue and pin the wood or is there some funky joinery
DIY,not_removed,my fireplace is nonfunctional and boarded off by the landlord i thought it looked ugly so i fixed it
DIY,not_removed,thanks i agree as i was thinking of doing a mod podge style delivery sticker for hogwarts or something similar my mom has some really thick old yellowed paper that would look so fitting ultimately though the gf liked it without the addition so i kept it blank
DIY,not_removed,yes on both nails and glue i had planned not to use any joints like the sketchup model but my dad insisted i cut out a shallow dado like deep and in to obviously be flush with the plywood around around the outside edge of the top and bottom piece we used a pneumatic nail gun and wood glue to secure it all together which turned out good because the nails were recessed without any heads showing
DIY,not_removed,you show a picture of your sketchup project and then a completed box appears do you have any photos of actually building the box itself
DIY,not_removed,favorite part of the whole post awesome diy
DIY,not_removed,it needs a pewter hogwarts crest like
DIY,not_removed,no sorry wish i had but this wasnt originally a diy it was a photolog for the girlfriend and i thought it was good enough to share my bad
DIY,not_removed,ketchup is absolutely disgusting its a tomato that used to be yummy now its a sad mash of acidic garbage
DIY,not_removed,you magnificent bastard
DIY,not_removed,try a magic eraser or goop off
DIY,not_removed,or eye makeup remover
DIY,not_removed,magic eraser is pretty good soap and water works if you use an abrasive really hard but it could mess up the paint
DIY,not_removed,this post appears to be to the wrong subreddit perhaps you should post this to rsomethingimade rcrafts rhomeimprovement or some other more appropriate subreddit try posting to rfindareddit or searching the httpswwwredditcomsubreddits to find an appropriate subreddit your post has been removed see the httpswwwredditcomrdiywikiguidelines for more information if you believe this is a mistake please thank you
DIY,not_removed,first off the galvanized coating is best removed by burning it off recommend placing the chain on top of some beefy logs in a barrel or fire pit then starting a massive hot fire on top of that after an hour or so when the chain glows red you will have burned off the galvanized coat do not inhale the fumes the shit is toxic after the fire dies down set the chain out in the sunlight and cover it with muriatic acid its used as a ph balancer in pools and spas a couple of days and you will have a nice pile of chain that looks like it was buried near saltwater for luck also do not use this acid with the chain on concrete it will eat tube finish off the concrete also use all protections muriatic acid is really pretty user friendly but you dont want it on your skin for long and certainly dont want it in your eyes used to dilute it and spray my wrought iron pieces for some customers who wanted a rust finish this is why i know how long it takes to rust bare steel use a plastic weed sprayer with about or so parts water to acid hope it helped
DIY,not_removed,build a very hot fire and throw it in there for a while try not to breathe any of the fumes muriatic acid will also do it vinegar would probably take forever
DIY,not_removed,galvanization is designed to really protect steel and iron from corrosion plating will probably not work at all are you attached to this particular piece of chain if not just go buy some ungalvanized chain and start there you can burn the zinc off in a hot fire make sure the toxic wind blows some direction away from people and animals
DIY,not_removed,buy new chain and avoid all of this shit
DIY,not_removed,maybe try a little nitric acid to remove the galvanized layer it dissolves most metals except precious metals to a degree might work who knows
DIY,not_removed,fire is about the easiest but do it outside and dont breath the fumes
DIY,not_removed,muriatic acid will work and in very short order be very careful though its super nasty stuff read up on the dangers
DIY,not_removed,have you tried making it an anode in an electrolysis chamber you can use a dc source and vinegar as electrolyte
DIY,not_removed,media blast
DIY,not_removed,honestly save yourself the hassle and it will never look quite like natural rustaged chain anyhow go to a scrap metal yard or most any swap meet and get an already rusted chain or try craigslist if youre adamant about using what you already have i had great success getting a padlock rusty by coating it in battery acid rinsing it off after a few hours and then wrapping it in wet rags with a liberal coating of salt for days
DIY,not_removed,deleted
DIY,not_removed,lol im sitting here thinking wtf im a chemist and idk what muriatic acid is look it up oh another name for hydrochloric acid also the muriatic is acid as opposed to viniger which is acetic acid so thus why it would take forever in viniger
DIY,not_removed,i looked online and at a few different stores all the chain i can find is either chrome or galvanized except for jack chain which is far too small and not the look i want
DIY,not_removed,this
DIY,not_removed,i dont really know how to do that but i could definitely look into it and give it a try i have a car jumper battery could that work
DIY,not_removed,logging chain is usually just carbon steel rustable at fleet farm
DIY,not_removed,huh i remember seeing ungalvanized chain when i was younger but youre right its not really out there anymore looks like fire would be your best bet that or mechanical removal

DIY,not_removed,is this a small butterfly sized application like sitting in the palm of your hand or a piece that mounts onto your back for a costume
DIY,not_removed,did you a literature study it would not surprise me if someone had looked into modeling butterfly wing movement also if this is your first electronics project it might be a tough nut to crack rarduino might be able to help you out but you should do some more research first dont expect them to write out your project at least have a proper description of what you want to do and include some sketches edit i now see this is some kind crafts project i assumed it was science related since you mentioned your advisor once again provide a proper description
DIY,not_removed,mounts to back
DIY,not_removed,a bit of every few inches should do the trick its the same stuff that holds trim on cars so its pretty strong make sure that that both surfaces are clean beforehand cabinets tend to have a lot of dust and grease on the underside and no adhesive will work on top of that
DIY,not_removed,zip ties screws nails staples double sided tape magnets hot glue super glue gorilla glue bread ties rubber bands thumb tacks christmas light hangers i would probably just got glue it if it were me did you make sure that the surface was clean before you tried to stick it i know not all of these will work but you didnt give much info
DIY,not_removed,i used contact cement for my install of the same under cabinet lights
DIY,not_removed,yeah its a wooden cabinet that is fairly clean the issue isnt the light strip itself but the connector to the transformer that keeps falling off and taking the whole strip with it i will give this a try
DIY,not_removed,ill post pictures when i can i dont want to use glue cause im renting and cause its hard to work the underside of the cabinet
DIY,not_removed,try stickyback velcro if that is still not strong enough then you can use plumbers metal pipe hanging strapping its a perforated metal tape that is easy to bend i use it all the time to make small brackets to hold stuff in place cut off a couple inches bend it into the right shape and use a couple screws to hold it in place simple cheap and easy sold anywhere plumbing supplies are sold

DIY,not_removed,
DIY,not_removed,could use bondo joint compound can work but might crackshrink as it dries if the gap is too big which might be a coat can resolve that though
DIY,not_removed,ive used joint compound lots of times on wood as a filler sometimes it takes applications due to shrinkage its easy to sand i always prime it before painting it good luck
DIY,not_removed,bondo
DIY,not_removed,i wouldnt
DIY,not_removed,this stuff is no joke sets up like stone
DIY,not_removed,building maintenance tech here i use this stuff all the time get a lot of chipped doors and cabinets from wheelchairs and such used to bondo but everyone complained of the smell this stuff has no smell and just as good as bondo not a paid actor or employee of durhams water putty
DIY,not_removed,easy to work with and never goes bad
DIY,not_removed,its been around forever and for good reason
DIY,not_removed,bondo wood filler is a part epoxy type stuff that can be applied to any void so that wont slow you down
DIY,not_removed,with using joint compound it may seem like it works quite well but down the road a bit after a few seasons of wetdry and hotcold that wood will expandcontractwarp at different speeds than the joint compound and you will end up with cracking and possibly it just falling off best bet for the buck is what usaltinpepper said below durhams water putty
DIY,not_removed,now create a small trailer for it that tows rotating red shells
DIY,not_removed,thats awesome such a good job well done
DIY,not_removed,if youre worried about losing the hub caps attach them to the wheels with a couple of cable ties
DIY,not_removed,i love how even without seeing the iconic m on the bonnet you can still tell its mario themed very marioesque
DIY,not_removed,this is sick please tell me you modified the stereo so it only plays mario kart music p
DIY,not_removed,til they sold the in america the three doors essential hot hatch treatment but youve done brilliantly with this an excellent project
DIY,not_removed,you have a wonderful family
DIY,not_removed,ac button off aka turbo boost on that car
DIY,not_removed,rshittycarmods
DIY,not_removed,i like mario but that car is awful
DIY,not_removed,i didnt notice where did you get the m decal that is in place of the mercury decal
DIY,not_removed,soup up the engine to make it fast too
DIY,not_removed,any chance you will be at the houston art car festival in april i think it would be a big hit
DIY,not_removed,makes me want to deliver pizza again
DIY,not_removed,and a fine coate of paint all over the entire garage lol
DIY,not_removed,this is incredible
DIY,not_removed,no
DIY,not_removed,im not gonna lie that looks awful
DIY,not_removed,proud owner of a clown car
DIY,not_removed,throw a roll cage in it if you plan on actually driving it on the road those small cars are death traps
DIY,not_removed,but what about the laws like heremin brazil you cant change the color without changing documentation
DIY,not_removed,looks like you couldnt afford to waste
DIY,not_removed,tried to make a mario car ended up looking like you have too much american pride
DIY,not_removed,car looks like shit and i bet your a gay
DIY,not_removed,man id eat that peach
DIY,not_removed,there was a guy four or five months that posted his project with rc cars turned into turtle shellsi havent been able to find that guy but i thought we could make a hilarious video if we got together
DIY,not_removed,i like this idea
DIY,not_removed,essential for hub caps
DIY,not_removed,thats on my list i want a customizable car horn to play any mario sounds i upload personalized license plates fuzzy question marks to hang from the mirror
DIY,not_removed,this
DIY,not_removed,thanks mine was labeled as the mercury tracer but essentially the same from your photo it looks like maybe the headlights were slightly different shapes but made in the same production line id imagine
DIY,not_removed,httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvgfdwqbnbzo
DIY,not_removed,man this one is stripped of everything no radio no ac no airbags no power steering no horneven the brake lights were malfunctioning several times
DIY,not_removed,before spraying or after spraying i did a little bit of sanding after i put all the clear coat on but stopped shortly because im lazy and it was looking pretty okay the old paint was kinda dull and took the colors really well so i didnt bother sanding it prepainting
DIY,not_removed,the little chrome m is right where the mercury symbol wasi spray painted the mercury logo black and affixed the m to the same round piece its the same m as is on the back the large circular m on the hood is is a magnet
DIY,not_removed,i totally would but i have no clue about car things if i knew how to modify it to make it faster id totally go for it
DIY,not_removed,sadly not im up in the northwest car shows are a fun idea though
DIY,not_removed,there might have been a little red dust cloud on things haha
DIY,not_removed,you lied fam
DIY,not_removed,we have a safer family carthis is my second little mostly intown car but i totally agree the crash tests are negative stars compared to what we have today
DIY,not_removed,no such laws that im aware of most the documentation of our vehicles revolve around the make model vin and licence plates
DIY,not_removed,theres no such thing as too much american pride you damn commie
DIY,not_removed,you know i actually thought i could retheme it pretty easy for independance day the m is magnetic so i could create a different one with stars or an eagle maybe window decals are not too expensive either
DIY,not_removed,i think youre thinking about devinsupertramp hes pretty popular on youtube you can check him out
DIY,not_removed,oh another idea mount led strips in the car and if you can outside the car inconspicuously that are in sync with the sfx horn you want to install the lights will light up with the invincibility star tune
DIY,not_removed,you just need some helium balloons tied to the back edit they could be shell shaped or banana
DIY,not_removed,and have something in the car to cut them in case you have a flat
DIY,not_removed,as to the mario sounds get on amazon and find a should run you less than you should be able to do a male to male cable from your phone into the mic in i recommend wiring it all the way to the battery and possibly even give it its own fuse that way it wont sound like crap or potentially mess up other electronics and of course nice work
DIY,not_removed,please add letsa go for when you need someone to speed up or go after light turned green
DIY,not_removed,the horn needs to be this sound
DIY,not_removed,they were built all over the joint ours were assembled here in australia from kits made in japan alongside the mazda which were made there wikipedia tells me your doors came from japan while the wagons and doors came from mexico and the canadian models all came from taiwan five door ford lasers and sedan meteor and later laser sedan were regular runabout hatches but the three doors were considered a bit sporty and were labelled with those dual circular headlights fuel injected and also turbocharged valve engines the turbo could also be had with which was a handy little thing essentially a forerunner to the impreza this model is also what sat underneath the capri although that was adapted by the australian arm and built here reckon they missed a trick not sticking the turbo drivetrain underneath the capri as an option that would have been fun we had a turbo torque steer sorry i mean a turbo capri and it was a laugh
DIY,not_removed,oh cool was curious about the chrome m thanks
DIY,not_removed,just look for mushrooms while youre out driving instant soup up
DIY,not_removed,just needs more wam
DIY,not_removed,low mounted bucket seat fourfive point harness should fix it but yeah fixing a rollcage to a normal road car for safety is stupid
DIY,not_removed,thats cool in brazil your documentation have color too it sucks because you cant paint it even with the same color police will surely stop you every time
DIY,not_removed,
DIY,not_removed,yeah thanks it looks like big effects props made the shells and devinsupertramp partnered with him for their awesome luigi video
DIY,not_removed,thats an awesome idea
DIY,not_removed,our next town parade im going to try and find a place that will fill up those huge red balloons with helium i can tie three on the car like in battle mode
DIY,not_removed,if youre going to wire it straight up to the battery you have to give it its own fuse unless you find car fires appealing
DIY,not_removed,yeah i saw a few websites that sold personalized car horns but i cant tell if theyre current a straight up pa would be a good choice if i can get the wiring correct maybe i can find one that could run off the connection or just get an inverter
DIY,not_removed,my car couldnt be less mario themed but i want this but i also want to steal the horn out of an old plymouth roadrunner too meep meep
DIY,not_removed,the sound effect when mario collects a coin in gaming views since nov ryoutubefactsbotwikiindex
DIY,not_removed,yeah that was the only spot where that showed up so far it was odd i washed vigorously and let it dry but the paint just didnt set in that spot well see how the rest of it goes so far it all looks like its holding well i finished painting nearly months ago and its been through some pretty extreme weather over and about
DIY,not_removed,still not too much
DIY,not_removed,id wager all but the very lowest end of those things have their own fuses
DIY,not_removed,most cheap cb radios have a pa function also getting a pa speaker for use with a cb and plugging it into your phone or something maybe with a small amp
DIY,not_removed,they all run off the which means you could run it off your cig lighter but you have to run a wire through the dash to mount the horn in the engine bay so why not just take the little bit of extra time and do it right httpwwwinstructablescomidhowtoaddacircuittoyourcar
DIY,not_removed,the woodworking is excellent i would be concerned about stability tho
DIY,not_removed,it skipped leg day
DIY,not_removed,your table is beautiful my only question is did the other table get upset when you had it hold the new table
DIY,not_removed,love the exposed box joint and subtle color shift to the top looks great
DIY,not_removed,can you lean on it without it tipping
DIY,not_removed,nice woodworking but is it practical going from the last picture i wouldnt know how to get in between the table and seating area assume the position beforehand and scoot in bet then youd have to hold onto the edge of the table as support which will tip over very fast and will reorganize your breakfast on the floor
DIY,not_removed,it looks like its on tiptoe
DIY,not_removed,yeah im no physicist but that looks like a bad idea unless its anchored to the floor somehow please reply to this comment every time drink or food hits the floor from table tilt
DIY,not_removed,i was thinking the same thing
DIY,not_removed,yeah i added extra supports not shown in the photos kind of realized i was missing something when i put the first coat of poly on the base much more solid now
DIY,not_removed,it got more upset when i accidentally put the circular saw through it
DIY,not_removed,i think he is referring to the topheavy looking design in other words is it tippy if for example someone leaned on it
DIY,not_removed,just slipped and fell right into it how did the table work out in the end im also not sure about there been enough support to stop it tipping over great work tho you should be proud

DIY,not_removed,its a fairly good design the only things that i can see that could be a problem with your drawing are your measurements to make it easier for when you actually get to the building stage it might pay to calculate the correct timber length measurements to take into account joining timber ive never worked with imperial measurements so as far as sizes go ill leave that up to someone more accustomed to them to comment about

DIY,not_removed,hair dryer on the highest setting or a heat gun might reheat the adhesive enough to separate it from the paper just make sure you keep the heat moving so you dont melt the lamination your goal is to heat it slowly and not more than you have to if that doesnt work i doubt you can salvage the paper and youll likely just have to leave it asis and call it a piece with character

DIY,not_removed,well ebay said it was from the or something but now that i have it i want to pair it with something from apples think different era
DIY,not_removed,awesome thank you ill search around for tutorials on this
DIY,not_removed,older interconnected smoke detectors use the red wire to communicate newer ones usually just use rf signals is there a red wire in there if not then you should be fine to use it if there is a red wire and youve confirmed the wired smoke detectors are interconnected and they are on this circuit then you may want to think twice about using it but even then i think youre fine
DIY,not_removed,is it a single live line running and a single white neutral line
DIY,not_removed,you could always locate an outlet in the hall below the attic and drop a wire to it drill through the top plate and seal with fire caulking and then add an outlet in the attic and another wire coming out of that box to the peak of the roof for a light thats what id do dont risk your familys safety by messing with the smoke detectors
DIY,not_removed,electrician here electrical code requires that smokies are on a circuit with lights on it so you should be just fine adding more lights to that circuit only potential issues would be if the circuit is already maxed out you may trip the breaker if you add a few lights so just to be safe i would recommend led bulbs also you should probably make sure that is indeed the smokie feed
DIY,not_removed,in that case just dont us the red wire in my part of the world smoke detectors have to be connected to a lighting circuit for code so it not uncommon to see smoke jb in a lighting box
DIY,not_removed,from memory it was last night sad that i cant be sure i think it was just black white and copper ground the detectors definitely look newer and are definitely interconnected i was playing with the one in the basement and it took waking the kids up to realize that the upstairs one was going off too oops
DIY,not_removed,yes black white and ground i believe
DIY,not_removed,youre right im thinking i may just avoid this circuit altogether its an older house though and getting into the walls is easier said than done through the lathe and plaster ceilings and old blownin insulation happily it looks like there are other jbsin the attic i can tap off
DIY,not_removed,good point i may not use it in that case ideally i want a number of fluorescent tubes all on the same switch for the attic so id hate to get halfway and realize im tripping it out one question if you dont mind this is an old house with what looks like much newer wiring in the attic its all romex that seems to be well labeled one the sheathing itself but in the panel in the basement the labels arent quite as helpful and there is nothing about what circuit the smokes are on how can i find out whats on the same circuit without playing trial and error with the breakers and running up flights of stairs to put my tester on the cable
DIY,not_removed,unfortunately that is how we normally do it but having people makes it much easier so get out your phones or just yell really loud off on as the other one flips the breakers using a breaker finder is the easiest way to go but you are not about to go out and buy one for this one simple task and honestly even though i own a breaker finder we usually dont even bother with it when labeling panels it is just as easy to have one of us flip the breakers one by one while the other one yells
DIY,not_removed,hah yeah i thought as much time to call in a favor with my wife to have her head down to the basement with her phone
DIY,not_removed,i would like to see some of your alcohol stoves do you make them yourself also
DIY,not_removed,love that lid very clever
DIY,not_removed,very nice i build plastic model kits this would be perfect to keep all my tools and paints
DIY,not_removed,are you sure woodworking is not your hobby
DIY,not_removed,i am starting a new youtube channel dedicated to this hobby but i dont have any published designs yet there are lots of designs on youtube but most of them lack any analyses for efficiency fuel economy and timing by starting this chanel i would do experiments and try to characterize different designs also planning to debunk some myths will link both channels when done you will be notified of new channel creation if subscribed to my current channel
DIY,not_removed,thanks i like the way it looks and how it makes the lid useful
DIY,not_removed,you are right since the mat and cutting tools for alcohol stoves are same as ones used for small plastic parts i might use this toolbox to build water rockets as well especially the cutting and building pressurized sections from plastic soda bottles thanks great suggestion
DIY,not_removed,it is for now but we all grow and move on i do love woodworking but want to take a new hobby something i never done before actually the woodworking is one of my hobbies i love camping hiking software design embedded computing rockets and learning new skills
DIY,not_removed,any chance you could link your youtube channel nice work by the way
DIY,not_removed,sorry my bad here is the
DIY,not_removed,count me in too keep up the excellent work
DIY,not_removed,thanks ill check it out and subscribe if its good content
DIY,not_removed,im not sure i understand what youre trying to do it seems like youre talking about stretching canvas over a frame for painting but you specifically say nailing the fabric to the canvas so maybe its not a canvas over a frame if youre talking about stretching canvas over a frame a staple gun is going to run about if you want to go that route you can always nail the canvas in manually but i think youre going to find its a bit harder to nail and stretch at the same time unless you have an assistant
DIY,not_removed,i have an old canvas that was painted before picked it up from the thrift store im trying to wrap fabric over it and secure it without the use of a staple gun for a fresh new look like the image linked below
DIY,not_removed,you can buy a staple gun for less than however as i had mentioned you can easily nail it in place or even just use old school flat thumb tacks if the frame youre using is soft enough wood ive made frames and stretched large canvases inches each in the past few years and its not really very difficult other than the corners which take a bit of work but trying to stretch it and wield a hammer and a small nail might not be all that easy unless you have someone to help
DIY,not_removed,okay thank you
DIY,not_removed,try wetdry paper and use it wet also not knowing what you are raving about doesnt help us help you pics pics and more picsk next power tools are your friend when dealing with stainless anything the shit is super hard and will flat wear you out trying to hand buff out scratches post more will se if we can help ya
DIY,not_removed,switch directions every time you move up in grit you will need patience if you want a good polish on something as hard as stainless youll have to work your way up to probably grit and then use or grades of polishing compound to get a mirror finish if a brushed look is adequate youll still probably have to get up to grit or so its a lot of sanding and a lot of money spent on sand paper
DIY,not_removed,solid stainless you could see if someone around you does electropolishing
DIY,not_removed,i have always used liberal amounts of and scotchbrite on a da works great
DIY,not_removed,simichrome paste
DIY,not_removed,i wound up buying an orbital sander and its just good enough now kind of a hazy mirror im never gonna get all of the scratches out without having someone else do it i know about going different directions for each grit i went then handsanded wet with and then did a buffing wheel on a drill with some compound i dont know how to post pictures here i may just take the polish out of it and leave it jut short of a mirror
DIY,not_removed,well im at it again and again getting pissed off i didnt like the finish last night i can always seem to get the grit to remove the previous scratches but when i hit grit i cannot get the grit scratches out and yes i am switching directions between each stage i am going through tons of paper and getting absolutely nowhere different brands same result i am at my wits end and i am just about to leave it with a brushed look and stop dealing with this nonsense
DIY,not_removed,just to add to this wet sanding will make your sandpaper last longer and be more effective and help clear out debris which scratches the surface
DIY,not_removed,switching directions is key because then you can see which scratches are from the last grit
DIY,not_removed,
DIY,not_removed,you should have started with a higher grit number is too coarse
DIY,not_removed,ive just decided to take it somewhere and let them deal with it i dont know what is wrong with my paper or method that i cant remove the previous scratches once i hit grit i guess a softer metal like copper or aluminium is easier
DIY,not_removed,you have the right idea go from coarse to ultra fine that is how the pros do it
DIY,not_removed,is not too coarse to get out flaws in the material
DIY,not_removed,there you go like i said stainless is bitch hard wanted to add when you get to a blurry finish they make an emery powder you make a paste out of to clean calcium build up off ceramicglass tiles super fine and works great cheap also anyway good luck with future endeavors dont give up trying if you get it polished get your moneys worth ask them how they do it and what tools are needed advice is free
DIY,not_removed,or a nail into the side of a stick use as a hook if the handle has holes you could hook it into
DIY,not_removed,duct tape on a stick
DIY,not_removed,magnet
DIY,not_removed,if the handle is light enough you could try filling the hole with water and float it to the top
DIY,not_removed,take some metal rod and curl it around a cylinder so that it forms a spiral about the diameter of the pipe pull the bottom of the spiral out some so that it can hook the handle better attach the other end to a broommopwhatever handle lower it down the hole and twirl it like spaghetti the intent is to catch the handle in the spiral and draw it upward until it becomes snaggedentangled enough to pull out

DIY,not_removed,thats a good idea im going to try that next
DIY,not_removed,duct tape didnt work cant get enough leverage to stick it to the faucet handle
DIY,not_removed,it aluminum
DIY,not_removed,like this httpmimgurcomfojesio
DIY,not_removed,what the heck man im doing a diy sprinkler job and have an issue i was getting real good advice im getting nothing from those other forums thanks for completely shutting down all of the help i was getting been on reddit for years and strict adherence to moderation guidelines is completely ruining this site its not like im karma whoring which is what most of those guidelines are setup to prevent i just want some genuine help
DIY,not_removed,yeah something like that but you want it to be neater and more spirally with the tail positioned so it can catch the handle
DIY,not_removed,i straightened it out like that and it still didnt work thanks though
DIY,not_removed,sand fill pitting with bondo polish until its flat buy some automotive paint to match yours and apply carefully might have to sand it gently between paint passes to get a good finish materials should cost you depending on if you screw up and youll have extra for if it ever happens again

DIY,not_removed,im really wondering how important the precision of the weights are questioning the whole system honestly but thats fine cant see how vs really matters though if you do need to bore out a weight your going to need a drill atleast though a drill press would be better if its going that deep and a metal cutting drill bit washers would be a hell of alot easier to be sure
DIY,not_removed,like it but damn isnt that a lot of canned vegetables and condensed milk and tomato paste and yams waiting for a food drive lol
DIY,not_removed,i posted the half of the project i ripped out that wire crap and made butcherblock style shelves out if all the shelving only cost
DIY,not_removed,my neighbors tease me about it too well they used to we recently had a lot of flooding from a hurricane and power was out for days no one could get out of the neighborhood we had our generator going coffee brewing chili made and hot water working guess where everyone was gathered 😏 it doesnt hurt to be a little prepared 😉
DIY,not_removed,no judgement used to work in a grocery store and completely understand its just fun to see what other people eat good work really saved a ton of space at least its not creamed corntrying to put a link of south parkbut alas viacom doesnt like youtube clips of their show edit for further smiles
DIY,not_removed,does the door not hit it when you open it i cant picture the door opening more than degrees to get in there
DIY,not_removed,good project only concern i have is the screws attaching it to your boards on the wall only anchor thru the beadboard the beadboard only looked to be thick at most and mdf style as in made of sawdust if you start to have problems id recommend pulling off the beadboard and on wall and putting a back on and anchoring the cabinet to studs looks good nice function hope it holds up
DIY,not_removed,seems to me like it might be a bit inconvenient having to open the door to get in then close it to get the can you want then open it again to leave the room just my two cents edit words
DIY,not_removed,color me impressed
DIY,not_removed,very cool
DIY,not_removed,great job op whats next changing out the wire shelves
DIY,not_removed,i like the narrow shelf idea for cans in a pantry you can always see what you have no digging for the ones in the back
DIY,not_removed,that is amazing as well as the other part of your pantry project
DIY,not_removed,i saw something similar in a friends pantry except it was vertical and on the wall basically their was multiple foot tall pvc pipes mounted on the wall that where just wide enough to fit a can inside underneath was a flat plate that was just far enough down so one can would be visible then whenever he wanted anything canned he would just grab one and the one above it would fall down and take its place
DIY,not_removed,cool project and well done what kind of tools did you use
DIY,not_removed,amazing project my cupboard under the stairspantry is suddenly looking a lot less organised my spice rack is boss though so theres that srsly nicely done
DIY,not_removed,the real question is why does the pantry door open inwards instead of out typically doors leading into small spaces like closets and pantries should open the other way
DIY,not_removed,so much corn
DIY,not_removed,excellent job on the pantry when i was young our entire basement was used for food home canned and store bought canned when it was on sale we went through a lot of that food within a year and i couldnt imagine feeding with a pantry that size some serious skills to pull that off
DIY,not_removed,marvelous
DIY,not_removed,i couldnt follow you on the instructions im not at all familiar with tools but damnas an anal person your pantry looks beautiful so take an upvote
DIY,not_removed,been trying to get my wife to organize our pantry for years since we moved to this house does your husband let you participate in any kind of wife exchange program that doesnt involve anything physical but instead all about shelf building if it helps put him at ease let him know my wife is good at sitting around watching netflix
DIY,not_removed,that looks heavy cool idea though
DIY,not_removed,never seen someone who uses so many canned food but apart from that its really cool idea how to store cans
DIY,not_removed,i hope those are some beefy hinges
DIY,not_removed,seems like using mdf you could have cut your cost by a hell of a lot why not use that instead of real wood
DIY,not_removed,ahahahaha welcome to candoor land of the encanted
DIY,not_removed,ive uploaded a video walkthrough for anyone who is interested it has some more up close views of how the shelves are attached as well uziggypox ucharb ushrunken utsdav ugravitygradient unarcolepticdoc
DIY,not_removed,have you thought about attaching a caster wheel at the bottom of the door on the doorknob side to keep the extra weight off the hinges
DIY,not_removed,did you have to reinforce the hinges on the door
DIY,not_removed,project seems like a can of corn
DIY,not_removed,fantastic
DIY,not_removed,i see you buy your kindling from some faceless megacorp consider supporting your local community
DIY,not_removed,a i hate grocery shopping so i just buy tons of non perishables all at once b were a family of including teenage boys c i like to have some extra on hand for emergencies we get hurricanes and other storms that cause flooding and then were trapped in our neighborhood for several days d its cheaper to buy it in bulk just trying to be thrifty
DIY,not_removed,and so organized alphabetical
DIY,not_removed,i think im hyperventilating i want your pantry
DIY,not_removed,there is a reason stores get swamped and emptied right before a huge winter storm when i lived in an apartment i still had enough food in my cupboards to last a month even if you dont have a pantry there is no reason to not have a stockpile of the stuff you need to keep you alive on a daily basis you dont need to be a doomsday prepper but everyone should really have some essentials laying around ive always wanted to make a rollingdropping rack for soups i really like the behind the door concept a lot
DIY,not_removed,i really love it and for a second i thought i will build something alike then i thought about the fact that i inly owbed foodcans in
DIY,not_removed,there is a slot for creamed corn but only for cornbread that shit is nasty
DIY,not_removed,it doesnt there are a few inches between the wall the holder is on and the door trim when the door is open its at degrees from the opening you can see the door is on in the picture down
DIY,not_removed,good point i did secure the top and bottom with pockethole screws directly into studs so hopefully that will help edit i forgot that i also did some along the edges into the wood crosspieces i installed ☺️
DIY,not_removed,maybe inconvenient but it is a fantastic use of the otherwise wasted space behind the pantry door
DIY,not_removed,it seems like it but its not really it extends beyond the door when its open so you can just pull the door toward you a bit if you have to reach back in the corner we put the stuff we dont use as much back there
DIY,not_removed,yeah op undo this project and post that s
DIY,not_removed,thank you
DIY,not_removed,
DIY,not_removed,exactly the builder installed deep wire shelves and it was maddening
DIY,not_removed,thank you
DIY,not_removed,thats a cool idea does she have a way to tell how many cans are in there
DIY,not_removed,tools miter saw biscuit joiner planer kreg pockethole jig belt sander coarse grit palm sander medium to fine grit block sander xtra fine grit wet sand after poly brad nailer level squares for scribing purposes materials select pine and beadboard approx glue biscuits various screws scrap wood for wood cross pieces on wall wood dye polycrylic
DIY,not_removed,ooooo can i see
DIY,not_removed,the pantry is in a short hallway butlers pantry leading to the dining room if the door opened out it would hit the cabinets across from it
DIY,not_removed,this made me think about the rest of the house we have varying closet door configurations most open out like you said but my husbands closet opens inward i think its because its right next to the door in our room so i guess this one is for the same reason it would block the walkway from the kitchen to the dining room but then one of my sons closets opens in which is inconvenient because it hits the hanging clothes weird
DIY,not_removed,we try not to eat it all in one sitting but sometimes we cant help ourselves
DIY,not_removed,thank you i usually do the same stock up when things are on sale i have a deep freeze and do the same with meat maybe people are under the impression that we only eat canned food which isnt the case i do enjoy canning as well were known for our strawberries around here so i usually make enough strawberry balsamic jam for the year thats at least pint jars just for jam i dont think people realize how much space food takes up or they are too good for canned food maybe ¯ツ¯
DIY,not_removed,thank you im way better at showing than explaining 😄
DIY,not_removed,😂 maybe you guys can do the building while your wife and i catch up on orange is the new black 📺🔶⚫️
DIY,not_removed,it is but its well secured i figured out how much weight it would be holding to make sure i secured it firmly enough 😊
DIY,not_removed,just to make enough chili and cornbread for this family i have to use a total of cans 😂
DIY,not_removed,its on the wall behind the door not the door itself you might be able to see it better there
DIY,not_removed,i did consider that but mdf tends to chip truthfully i dont think it would have stood up to the weight of all those cans
DIY,not_removed,its hung on the wall behind the door not on the door itself
DIY,not_removed,
DIY,not_removed,im not sure if this is a compliment but im feeling positive today so ill just say thanks
DIY,not_removed,thanks
DIY,not_removed,people need to be watching the video before downvoting imo
DIY,not_removed,😂😂😂 it was actually birch logs that i bought to cut in slices and wood burn for ornaments we arent a state known for our birch trees also i live in a farming community at the edge of a large metropolitan area were all about supporting our local farms here unfortunately not everything i want or need is able to be sourced nearby im sure nothing you buy is imported from out of the state or country wed all be able to see it in that glass house youre living in
DIY,not_removed,e zombie apocalypse
DIY,not_removed,b were a family of including teenage boys my boys are and and already eat as much as my wife and i do you have any advice for the impending doom
DIY,not_removed,g plan to feed an army after the lizard leaders take over
DIY,not_removed,do you need a paper bag i know exactly where they are 😉
DIY,not_removed,you are so right even if you just become ill for a few days at least you dont have to leave to feed yourself sometimes we just dont feel like running to the grocery store so we eat what we have i have a deep freezer as well so were usually in good shape we dont want to be eating milk sandwiches which is what we assume everyone else is doing why else do they stock up on milk and bread 😂 i would love to see what you make i considered doing a between the studs design but there is an oven and various outlets on the other side of the wall that i didnt want to have to deal with this ended up working better for us you could even put doors on if you wanted it to be invisible edit more thoughts
DIY,not_removed,also corn fritters right corn fritters are delicious
DIY,not_removed,👍
DIY,not_removed,thank you you can always make just shelves if you prefer
DIY,not_removed,that makes sense and i can see how you need to use all the space you have as efficiently as possible weather its convenient or not having a family of six
DIY,not_removed,she said that she might cut a slot down the center or drill a hole every few inches i dont know if she ever did that tho personally i like your top shelf option more it just looks a lot nicer that raw pvc pipe
DIY,not_removed,thanks for the list you mentioned scribing in your post as well what is that
DIY,not_removed,im going to try to make this for my pantry where are all the used though or was that for the pantry shelves
DIY,not_removed,ha
DIY,not_removed,i mean weight on the hinges which honestly should be fine and weight on a panel door skin all in all the actual shelf construction looks great
DIY,not_removed,ah what a rack as a fellow canned soup fab i appreciate this very much
DIY,not_removed,wow shows how much i pay attention looks good
DIY,not_removed,f avoiding all of just in case its worse than
DIY,not_removed,you never can be too prepared
DIY,not_removed,build a bunker of pasta and sauce 😂 our other two kids are and and they eat way more than youd think i sympathize two of the baskets in the pantry are just snacks for them applesauce fruit cups teddy grahams etc the bottom shelf is mostly juices water bottles and other drinks for them between all the kids i generally buy over a dozen gallons of drinks a month and they only get juice once a day the rest of the time is milk or water
DIY,not_removed,yasssss and spoon bread
DIY,not_removed,thats a great idea pvc is strong i bet you could cut a slot all the way down thank you it took me awhile to figure out a way to be able to see what was in there i was originally going to have it closed in i thought maybe pegboard but wasnt thrilled with the look or plexiglass but that stuff is expensive sheesh
DIY,not_removed,it is transcribing defects in the wall onto the item you want to abut the wall most walls are not perfectly flat so if you put a squared up board against it there will be gaps httpwwwfamilyhandymancomtoolshowtoscribeforaperfectfitviewall i did have an additional level of complication for the back wall because the shelf was surrounded by wall on sides luckily my corners were at a slightly obtuse angle i measured the angle by pushing a square against the back wall then measuring the distance to the sidewall at the mark iirc mine was about a out of square at i was able to cut a snug fit then scribe the back after that was sanded down i could dry fit it again and scribe the sides because i removed material from the back edge it no longer met the back wall due to the sides being at an obtuse angle that meant i had to remove material from the sides to get it to fit snugly again this was good since i needed to scribe the sides anyway if the side walls had been at an acute angle i would have had to find a different way to go about this whole thing im not sure if that makes sense or not
DIY,not_removed,the are what the counters and shelves are made of thats great post pics when you do
DIY,not_removed,its not on the door its on the wall behind the door in the dead space the door is off the hinges in this pic
DIY,not_removed,i see what you did there 😒
DIY,not_removed,best comment here
DIY,not_removed,exactly
DIY,not_removed,no problem if you need any help designing something just ask and good luck with your project
DIY,not_removed,help please we are making this now we used for the dividers between the cans and the cans wont roll forward enough to grab the bottom can even when we tack on a piece of shoe molding to push the can forward its like the is too much wider than the width of the can if that makes sense did you use the for your dividers
DIY,not_removed,ah completely missed that part
DIY,not_removed,hang on let me measure
DIY,not_removed,the board the cans rest on is but i cut the dividers back to but it depends on your can size hopefully that helps and sorry for the confusion
DIY,not_removed,no worries description is a little confusing
DIY,not_removed,thank you ill trim them down and see if that works
DIY,not_removed,if youre looking for more information about how i completed the project dimensions more technical procedural stuff what went wrong check out the build article that i posted on my website im happy to answer any questions that you might have about the process or about what i did that was stupid and should be done better
DIY,not_removed,nice to see a simple diy that most people can do
DIY,not_removed,wont the soil go into the reservoirs
DIY,not_removed,ive used these some points from my experience they keep the soil at the perfect level of moisture at all times even when the sump is low dont let it go dry though roots will grow into the bottles block the drainage and block the intake tube a layer or two of thick landscaping cloth is required a soluble fertilizer can be supplied via the watering tube i used a bamboo skewer stuck through a small styrofoam ball for a float to indicate water level in the sump i used liters tubs with liters of sump and liters of soil i needed to water weekly to the point where water flows from the drain when the plants reached full growth they needed watering semiweekly especially the tomatoes i used a bark mulch sphagnum peat and perlite mix it lasts about years i use miracle gro in spring during the growth part and switch to during fruiting i feed very weakly with every watering a scraped teaspoon at most
DIY,not_removed,having trouble understanding the slot in the bottom of the containers doesnt that not make it a reservoir anymore and just let it drain out the bottom
DIY,not_removed,isnt this a bad idea because the totes arent usually food safe eg plastics that we eat food from like the milk jugs when formed they use materials chemicals that are specifically approved for foodwater for human use little to no chemical leech things like totes and even some gallon buckets use a cheaper process that leeches chemicals because who cares it doesnt matter for non food uses like paint dont get me wrong i like the idea i want to do something like this i just dont want chemicals leeching into something i might eat
DIY,not_removed,i made one of these about years ago they are cool but they really cant hold up outside theyre only good for like or seasons
DIY,not_removed,can anyone explain to me how the water flows up from the small holes in the milk jugs maybe i am just an irrigation noob but how does the water go up to get water near the top layer of soil
DIY,not_removed,an even easier way to do those is lose all the gear fill the tub with perlite cut the same hole in the side up from the bottom and youre good to go
DIY,not_removed,its a bit like hugelkultur with plastic milk jugs instead of logs
DIY,not_removed,thanks for some ideas prefers aeroponics with special led for growing other greens but this with some changes might be something worth testing out
DIY,not_removed,pure frickin genius very excited to try this seems simple enough that even i can do iti have no diy skills at all p thank you
DIY,not_removed,thanks for posting i need to get off my butt and build that greenhouse ive been wanting to do for a while now mmmmm cant go more local than your own backyard for some fresh food
DIY,not_removed,real cool
DIY,not_removed,i recently built a ft wood box with a pond liner pretty similar to this in theory the only noticeable difference that popped out for me is your drainage holes are above your reservoir did you think about putting your drainage holes at the top or middle of your reservoirs
DIY,not_removed,i love subirrigated systems i had these types until hail took them out this year i got four x galvanized steel stock tanks i had to construct them a bit differently but they have been awesome so far
DIY,not_removed,best write up i have seen in awhile thanx doing this asap
DIY,not_removed,i could actually do this one well done
DIY,not_removed,let us know how to works out a similar buried irigation thing are ollas buried terracota pots that do pretty much the same thing also as other people said put a mesh screen rock or something to stop bugs from getting in
DIY,not_removed,beautiful concept those of you who are alarmed at chemical leeching could use a gall olive barrel cut in half and redesign for a circle in my area the redorange olive barrels are but you would two planters
DIY,not_removed,black is a good color choice as solar will warm the soil in early spring and late autumn providing a significantly longer growing season and natural evaporation will reduce any excess heat during midsummer
DIY,not_removed,nice
DIY,not_removed,anyone from rmicrogrowery got any imput on applying this to cannabis
DIY,not_removed,so whats the advantage of the reservoirs rather than just having overflow holes in the side of the tote and dirt in the bottom i would have thought the dirt would hold almost as much water as the reservoirs
DIY,not_removed,hmmm melons the vines are going to spread like crazy
DIY,not_removed,note standing water is where mosquitoes breed and the mosquito that carries zika virus can breed in a cap full of water i would recommend you place a fine mesh screen over your holes that go directly to standing water it should be as easy as hot gluing on some pieces cut from window screen
DIY,not_removed,hey fellow redditors if youre interested in this type of farming look into echo they have an amazing ray of ideas and examples of urban gardening
DIY,not_removed,very cool
DIY,not_removed,hey i plan on trying this out for my new condo im new to gardening so can someone please help explain how water irrigation works in this tub from what i understand you fill the bottles through the tube so does that mean the soil will be consistantly wet until all the water dries up
DIY,not_removed,those two plants will feed you well come harvest time i plumb reckon
DIY,not_removed,any ideas to monitor the water level like that strip you stick into your engine to check oil level
DIY,not_removed,what plants work best with this setup id like to start growing some peppers and such would those be inappropriate
DIY,not_removed,hey guys i see that this post has blown up way more than i expected it to im a bit busy with stuff but ill try to come back periodically and answer questions for people as i have time also if you have a question check through the rest of the comments there are some people who are experienced with sub irrigation methods commenting with tips and good info
DIY,not_removed,the cartons definitely work but having done this sort of thing myself i do need to warn peoplethe cartons break apart in a couple of years leaving lots of little plastic shards in your soil so this is very easy to do and diy but not a permanent set up
DIY,not_removed,i dont really know much about gardening but why cant you just water the top of the dirt
DIY,not_removed,if youre looking for a new idea search for aquaponic systems basically a fish reservoir which is pumped through vegetables which consumen the fish waste and in turn filtrate the water source work at a pond specialist
DIY,not_removed,nice idea i think i am gonna replace the milk jugs with a layer of gravel with an old cloth on top to prevent the space between the little stones from clogging with dirt lazy but i really like the idea of irrigating from the bottom and having the bottle to check water levels
DIY,not_removed,since it appears everybody is expert here i would like to ask a thing whats the best plant to plant in a vase half of this ones size
DIY,not_removed,whats the benefit that you need to water a bit less seems like a lot of work creating an unnatural system when you can just toss some potting soil in a bucket and just water it
DIY,not_removed,wasnt there some information about not watering from the bottom up because contaminants rose to the surface and could affect the plant edit looked around apparently subirrigation is only bad in soils with contaminants or salts as those can rise to the surface and be absorbed by the plant or affect its growth probably not a big deal with potting soil
DIY,not_removed,i use a sip to grow my medicine over in rmicrogrowery we get crafty with farming in tight places
DIY,not_removed,do you want mosquitos because not having a cover on the water container is how you get mosquitos
DIY,not_removed,but will the tomatoes taste like plastic container
DIY,not_removed,nice jugs
DIY,not_removed,not really the soil doesnt flow like a liquid or anything it mostly just sits right where you put it the holes in the top facing side of the jugs arent big enough for the soil to just go through them what tiny particles of soil may get into the reservoir arent even enough to turn the water a muddy color if your soil is so sandy and fine that it can flow through those holes you dont have ideal soil and need to amend it with things like coir mulch and peat or get new soil the soil does wick water out of the reservoirs though which is exactly what is supposed to happen
DIY,not_removed,a little will when placing it and a lot will if water seeps down through the soil you can get cheap filter cloth to prevent that from happening you can also just put holes on the sides or bottom and the water will seep upward a bit through capilary action
DIY,not_removed,if youre worried about this you can cover the reservoirs with a bit of weed blocker which will keep even saturated soil from dripping into the reservoirs not that it would be much of a problem its thin garbagebag like plastic sheeting with many tiny sievelike perforations or a spun fibre usually laid on top of yard and garden soil before being covered with mulch to allow drainage while preventing weeds from sprouting a foot roll costs a couple of bucks and will last you forever i put a piece at the bottom of all my containers to stop soil from dribbling through the drain holes works a treat
DIY,not_removed,great links i love the gardenweb forums
DIY,not_removed,so the slot in the bottom is what lets water in the surrounding soil into the void space of the jugs if you didnt have that any water building up in the surrounding soil could float the voids if it built up enough pressure but because of the overflow ports on the sides and how they get filled from the top that everything below the overflow ports will be saturated with water that layer of soil will be fully saturated but the water will also be in the containers as standing water not absorbedadsorbed water in the soil i dont know if the plants will send roots down into the containers or just into the moist soil around the containers but its good to have the moisture deep plants do better with deeper root systems and watering like this will make them grow deep roots to get to the water i think the jug idea is unnecessary not that it doesnt work but that its just not needed for growing using a piece of pvc pipe to water directly to the bottom of your tote and having overflow holes along the sides so it keeps the water line low would work just as well but you also need to water the soil completely occasionally to keep it moist moist soil hold together better think mucky wet clay or dry crumbly clay so the upper roots still need good moist soil so its still beneficial to have a good soaking watering from the top down my thing is that plants grow in the wild without any help from humans and that they only use rain so i water like the rain i use a low volume sprayer that gently waters my plants takes about hours to get the amount of water they need but it falls slow enough that it can soak in and not run off or become standing water good rule of thumb is to use an empty tuna can in your garden when you water watch the tuna can when its full youve watered enough
DIY,not_removed,the slot in the bottom is to allow the water to flow into the reservoirs from the bottom there are no holes in the bottom of the tote so when a heavy rain happens and the soil gets saturated the water likes to take the path of least resistance so it flows into the empty space in the reservoirs from below the soil surrounding the reservoir will stay saturated which in turn wicks water to the soil above the reservoirs and up to the root system in cases where there is enough rain that it completely fills the reservoirs there are overflow holes on the sides of the tote and not the bottom the overflow holes line up with the tops of the reservoir so when there is enough water to fill them excess drains out the sides not the bottom when you see it in action it works very well
DIY,not_removed,going off of memory all of the plastic totes that i had been curious about in the past have tended to be polyproplene or pp recyclable i just checked the bottom of a gray sterilite tote the exact same one used in this diy and it is indeed pp which are food safe
DIY,not_removed,youre completely wrong though and this is an alarmist post about it with nothing to back it up the totes are safe to grow food in and dont leech chemicals into anything you havent done your research and are just making assumptions as to the material used while i was sleeping somebody already posted studies about the subject and why youre wrong below
DIY,not_removed,yup you are right you should choose containers made from hard plastics because the chemicals that make plastic soft are nasty as fuck in europe there are eurocontainers or euroboxes with a defined size made from pp hard plastics these are food safe
DIY,not_removed,all the studies ive seen involving leeching are due to acidic chemicals breaking down the plastic the soil might cause some leeching but the plants do not uptake the chemicals of course the studies ive seen have to do with growing in whole tires not plastic totes but if plants do not uptake the leeched chemicals from tires i cant imagine totes would be much different
DIY,not_removed,i should post some pictures of the one we built we used a wood planter box and lined it with a fish safe pond liner the pond liners are nice because theyre designed to do that
DIY,not_removed,especially leaving it in the heatsun thats how you leech chemicals
DIY,not_removed,is it just he milk jugs that are the issue or the tote too i saw a fancier version of this where the totes were in a wooden housing and instead of jugs there was pvc would that be better
DIY,not_removed,you should provide solid evidence instead of speculation
DIY,not_removed,i find it varies depending on what type of plastic the container is made from some plastics become rather brittle in the sun and wont last long at all some of these totes ive had last for several seasons still cheap as hell spent more on the soil in the container than the container itself
DIY,not_removed,httpsenwikipediaorgwikicapillaryaction tldr water is sticky so it clings to the sides of small voids and that is enough force for it to raise up a certain amount its the same phenomenon that causes water to wick up a paper towel
DIY,not_removed,the soil wicks water up water will travel through the dampish soil to about above the water level in the sump
DIY,not_removed,an even more effective method is to mix water stroring polymer crystals like crystal soil in with the soil the polymer has far greater water retention than perlite
DIY,not_removed,never seen those before i looked it up and id totally try if i had the space to do so in another thing to add to the list of things to try right next to walipini
DIY,not_removed,theyre not really above the reservoir i think that is just a trick of the angle theyre sitting at when the photo is taken the drainage holes are level with the top of the reservoirs
DIY,not_removed,i hear ya about hail i live right in the middle of tornado alley so i frequently have to watch helplessly from the window as hail or damaging winds wreck stuff in my garden my poor tomato plants took a beating in the recent week long outbreak of severe weather but all of them ended up better on the other side of it and are putting out plenty of tomatoes now
DIY,not_removed,ive seen the clay pots used as reservoirs before theyre super cool and if i ever get a chunk of land i can set up a little farm on id probably get some or have a friend make some for me not too worried about bugs here since the reservoirs will get drained relatively quickly due to the high heat and thirsty plants but id certainly address it if it became a problem im out there every day so id notice it right away the water simply doesnt stay there long enough for mosquito larvae to mature but if it is more of a problem in the region youre in capping it off could be as easy as sticking a cup or a jar over the end of the reservoir access tube
DIY,not_removed,the totes are pp there is no chemical leeching they are perfectly safe
DIY,not_removed,exactly what i was thinking it also keeps light from penetrating the container which ive seen cause unwanted growth of things like algae in lighter colored containers when i was at the store assessing the containers for some reason the black ones had the thickest plastic as well so it got points for being sturdier than some of the others when making my choice too
DIY,not_removed,try rspacebuckets maybe there are a ton of sub irrigated systems but id imagine with that since you need to do nutes and flush you might do better with a drip irrigation line submerged similar effect different system
DIY,not_removed,dont bother too complicated fill the tub with perlite and cut a hole above the bottom plant plants keep tub topped off with fert solution super easy passive hydroponics edit this is all you need if you are careful with nutes however most people arent i also install a pvc tube with a screen on the end so i can stick a tube down to the bottom and siphon out the contents to flush occasionally
DIY,not_removed,oh no the dirt totally doesnt hold as much water as a reservoir you can prove that with a simple experiment take a cup full of soil then take another cup of the same size full of water and pour it into the cup full of soil it definitely wont all fit then you may as well make a mud pie because youre already playing in the dirt the advantage is easy even watering uneven watering can cause several problems also watering with less frequency this build is suitable for larger plants but youll see self watering pots and containers of all sorts sold at nurseries and garden stores they all have water reservoirs of some sort either with access from the side or the top for adding water this isnt ideal for all crops but for many it works out wonderfully
DIY,not_removed,theyll have trellises to climb they just arent large enough that ive put them in there yet
DIY,not_removed,mesh might be a good addition for people with problems with mosquito larvae but there are other ways of dealing with it ideally the water in your reservoir shouldnt be standing long enough for mosquito larvae to establish themselves or long enough for algae that mosquito larvae eat to grow for that matter plants that arent so thirsty as to require so much water would probably do better in a different type of planter you can also just cap the end as well and remove as need if you find yourself with a mosquito problem as gluing mesh in would mean that you could not see in well enough to see your roots and water to look for any problems you can also buy mosquito control rings if youre having problems and one would be more than sufficient for a reservoir of this size ive never found any mosquito larvae anywhere in my garden but the water doesnt stay there long before the plants suck it up or the heat evaporates it in the full heat of the summer here it can be a struggle to get enough water to the garden and the plants get thirsty enough to require constant attention often needing multiple waterings a day since container gardens wont hold water like the ground does considering my close proximity to a drainage ditch full of standing water bullfrogs and lightning bugs they seem to have better options than a garden that is tended to daily where theyd certainly be interfered with if they showed up we also dont have zika carrying mosquitos here
DIY,not_removed,essentially the tub should be deep enough that not all of the soil will be soaking wet but because the soil will wick water up from the saturated soil around the reservoirs the soil above should get adequate moisture for your plants the root systems will also grow down towards the reservoirs and the plant will simply pull the water up through its roots as it need it as well if youre new to gardening be sure this type of set up will work for the type of plants you want to grow this is ideally for very thirsty plants such as tomatoes or peppers it is not ideal for some plants that are really picky about drainage though like potatoes
DIY,not_removed,im pretty excited about the in the picture actually theyre a type of rare melon called kajari melon and ive never had them before theyre very colorful and have been described as sweet and candylike in many of the reviews ive read
DIY,not_removed,you can just look inside with a flashlight if needed other than that you could totally use like a wood dowel as as dipstick if you wanted
DIY,not_removed,peppers would grow well in a set up like this during the height of growing season peppers can very thirsty plants so something like this is appropriate for them if youre new to gardening check out what planting dates would be good for your region to plant peppers out this link could help httpwwwalmanaccomgardeningplantingdates
DIY,not_removed,definitely not meant to be permanent with containers like this i dont recommend leaving the soil for more than a few years anyhow i take the soil out of them and break it up amend it etc or discard as needed at that time it would be good to replace the jugs the good thing about that vs manufactured sub irrigation planters is that rather than cleaning and removing old roots from the reservoir assembly you can just discard the jugs and replace them way less fiddly scrubbing involved
DIY,not_removed,you can just water the top of the dirt but there are many reasons why a set up like this may be more ideal for some plants there are several comments here covering that already if you want to look through them less work watering less wasted rain water deeper roots helping prevent the spread of certain pests and diseases even watering easy access to and fertilizers and nutrients etc this set up is ideal for plants that get very thirsty such as tomatoes or peppers some plants would not do well with this type of setup however such as potatoes for example which are notorious for needing lots of drainage compared to other crops in short for the type of plants this set up is ideal for you get stronger healthier plants and do less work for them than just watering from the top would require
DIY,not_removed,i have looked at stuff like that before a lot of the aquaponic systems ive seen tend to be stressful for the fish which i wouldnt want fish waste is a great source of nutrients though very commonly used for fertilizer if i could find a way to keep the fish happy and utilize the waste for nutrients id certainly consider it
DIY,not_removed,a vase not a planter half the size of this tub would be gallons nearly double the size of a gallon bucket if you have planter that large you could put tons of different plants in something like that i dont know about best as that is a matter of personal preference what region youre in what time of year etc id probably put a tomato plant in it or a pepper plant but i primarily like to grow things that i can eat ive never seen a gallon vase though and if it is a vase and not a planter youd probably need to add holes for drainage somehow since vases generally dont have any
DIY,not_removed,it is actually very little work this project can be completed in about half an hour the benefit is that you get consistent even watering you save water from rainfalls that in other systems would go to waste and the system isnt unnatural at all irrigating ones crops isnt a new concept and modern agriculture and the rise of civilization as we know it rather than living nomadically is something that happened because people began manipulating food crops with techniques like irrigation in climates as hot as mine gets in the summer youre literally watering multiple times per day or your plants will die this is so much easier and with one half an hour of work ive saved myself hours of work over the summer sub irrigated systems are widely used this build just utilizes cheap materials to be blunt when you say you can just toss some potting soil in a bucket and just water it i dont think youre really appreciating how nuanced growing food and getting good harvests can be if it was really just that simple everybody would have a green thumb but that just isnt the case
DIY,not_removed,im seeing downvotes but isnt this true
DIY,not_removed,nope pp is perfectly safe no cancer
DIY,not_removed,lol no plants dont really work that way in any case if they did vegetables would all probably taste like shit since many fertilizers are literally made from excrement in comparison to the soils fertilizer compost etc that youre growing the plant in the plastic is pretty inert
DIY,not_removed,bro is that your only source of personality sure many people like weed not everyone loves there life around it
DIY,not_removed,awesome love the setup
DIY,not_removed,super cool no idea what you mean about the soil wicking water out from the reservoir so you dont water directly on the plants base but just fill the reservoir or does it vary plant to plant
DIY,not_removed,the dirt is going to move when it becomes water and mix it will get in your reservoirs over time i would recommend putting a layer of landscaping type fabric overaround the reservoirs to keep it out
DIY,not_removed,wow thanks for the random tip ill remember tuna can water guide for the rest of my life now
DIY,not_removed,this is probably a dumb question but what is the main purpose of the reservoirs is it essentially just to keep the soil from becoming too saturated and to slowly release water into the soil
DIY,not_removed,but the water will flow out of the reservoirs just as easily and saturate the soil up to the same level the bottom will always be sitting in water
DIY,not_removed,youre correct these totes are food safe plastic the above comment is one of those alarmist things from people who dont do their research these are perfectly safe and dont leach chemicals into the soil
DIY,not_removed,wow you argue a fallacy of burden of proof when im trying to point out hey could this be really bad for your health then you pull a strawman did you actually read some of those links you refer to they do state what you are doing could actually leech chemicals that are bad for you i did do some additional reading there are too many numerous links to share in short yes in the usa just because a container is labeled just refers to how it is to be recycled not to how it was made to be absolutely safe it needs to be virgin plastic never used before in any other use eg not recycled form some plastic used told hold something like paint for example additionally there is an issue of dyes and the chemical agent used to release the plastic from its mold my plea here is for your health at the very least use a plastic specifically labeled food safe or food grade but what do i know i only have a degree in natural science appeal to authority good luck to you and your tu quoque i hope for your health you are correct am i am wrong no sarcasm intended
DIY,not_removed,the totes are made from pp and are perfectly safe literally the same material as what youre suggesting as a safe alternative
DIY,not_removed,if i remember correctly those yellow plastic cat litter containers are food safe i dont remember the plastic rating of it off hand though
DIY,not_removed,the soil might cause some leeching but the plants do not uptake the chemicals youre gonna need to qualify this with something plants do tend to absorb things from the soil
DIY,not_removed,neither are an issue the totes are safe
DIY,not_removed,i repurposed an old recycling bin tough hard plastic made for the sun drain holes too
DIY,not_removed,thanks for the reply that makes sense
DIY,not_removed,perlite is for aeration and lightening the soil a peat moss or coco peat mix is for water retention and soil composition
DIY,not_removed,nice
DIY,not_removed,definitely subscribed to spacebuckets my thought is if this was created close to the soil roots would fill the jugs and create a semi hydroponic system where nutes could be delivered to the roots
DIY,not_removed,cool i live in canada melons have little chance up here
DIY,not_removed,thank you
DIY,not_removed,depends on how large your fish space is and what fish but you could also hook it up to a pond and put some mechanical filtration in get creative
DIY,not_removed,thank you for the answer i did mean a little less than half of that volume i have got these vases this big which i always thought they were too small for something else than flowers and succulent plants ah and i live in a mediterranian hot temperate climate
DIY,not_removed,i made a very similar setup for tomatoes a few years ago its nice to leave the house for a few days without having to ask anyone to water your garden
DIY,not_removed,plants and grow lights are not illegal just the specific plants some people choose to grow are
DIY,not_removed,for areas that have mosquitoes yes this would be a problem they only need a little bit of water to lay their larvae it is a rather easy fix though cut a small slit along the edge of the upright bottle and put in a super fine mesh trim off any excess then hot glue it into place
DIY,not_removed,op mentioned above that the water in the reservoir shouldnt be sticking around long enough for mosquitoes to hatch and breed
DIY,not_removed,you are a patient and educating man have an upvote
DIY,not_removed,thanks it does the trick and is much cheaper and just as effective if not more so than a lot of premade sub irrigated planters i think i only spent bucks for the storage tote and the rest was free since it would have been trash if not repurposed if you add in something like a tomato cage or other trellis structure purchased to go with it youd be looking at maybe adding bucks to the total purchased for the build to purchase a premade sub irrigated planter of a similar size and function instead of a diy one youd be spending around bucks or more
DIY,not_removed,no you dont water at the plants base you just fill the reservoir or here usually the sky fills the reservoir for me but once it gets hotter out ill probably need to fill it relatively frequently
DIY,not_removed,the small voids in soil forms capillaries that allow water to rise against gravity from a saturated zone to the nonsaturated areas above it it is the same thing as when the liquid level in a straw is slightly higher than the liquid level in a cup a straw is a relatively large diameter tube so the liquid doesnt rise much in that case but it is easy see
DIY,not_removed,never had a problem with it when i look into the reservoirs the water is generally crystal clear and what little soil makes it into the reservoir hasnt had any impact on the effectiveness if i were making a fancier more expensive set up such as using pvc piping id probably go with landscaping fabric or something similar though these reservoirs i only use for a season or two and they get replaced with new jugs by the time any of that could start to become problematic
DIY,not_removed,sandy soil is awful for many common plants a nuisance for drainage and peat moss is excellent for many high need plants like orchids and carnivorous plants when harvested sustainably its a great planting medium
DIY,not_removed,exactly its a balance between too little and too much by doing handwatering you have no real risk of overwatering however you have a strong risk of underwatering the reservoirs remove that risk without introducing a strong risk of overwatering which for example might happen if you had a drip system on a timer that you hadnt carefully calibrated to what your plants need
DIY,not_removed,yes
DIY,not_removed,little tightly wound arent you the containers are safe and no manner of concern trolling will change that if you really had links stating that polypropylene was unsafe it isnt youd share them as for your degree on the internet you could claim to be the king of mars and the best rocket surgeon in the galaxy doesnt mean it is true or that even if you have some vaguely unspecific degree like you claim that it is relevant to what is being discussed polypropylene is regarded widely as one of the safest plastics and anybody who wants to be assured of that can find numerous sources for that claim i havent yet found a single one that says it isnt safe however so whatever arcane methods youre using for your links too numerous to share must be similar to the ones other alarmists use like all the numerous studies that antivaxxers like to claim proves vaccines are unsafe compared to the diseases they prevent since you dont seem capable of constructive conversation on the subject and are emotional and reactive this will be the end of my interaction with you since it wont accomplish anything spread your misinformation as you choose others will certainly post evidence to the contrary
DIY,not_removed,anyone want some vegetables from the litter box
DIY,not_removed,here is basically you need the perfect conditions of highly acidic or basic soil with high levels of contamination for a plant to uptake enough heavy metals or chemicals to cause an adverse reaction by eating them none of those factors would be present in a small container garden in tires or plastic totes
DIY,not_removed,check the underside of containers to determine their suitability numbers and are a good choice for planting edibles others are not httpwwwrodalesorganiclifecomgardenareyourplantcontainersleachingtoxinsyourfood
DIY,not_removed,these pp plastic tubs have lasted several seasons for me im all for repurposing things that work though
DIY,not_removed,definitely the same type of principles involved ive seen people use pvc pipe for very neat sub irrigated systems for that purpose pvc is kinda pricey but you can really easily build this type of thing with it and you can add all sorts of options like drainage plugs to fully drain and flush etc and yes the roots totally will go into the jugs from the holes made for them to get in there that are on the top side of the jugs if you use liquid fertilizersnutes and whatnot it is just as easy as pouring it in there
DIY,not_removed,try a variety called minnesota midget you might be successful with those theyre a small variety of muskmelon similar to a cantaloupe that does well in the shorter cooler growing season in minnesota hence the name melons are not self pollinating so if you try growing them youll need to learn to identify the male flower and then use something like a clean paint brush to hand pollinate the female flowers
DIY,not_removed,alas no pond here in my little apartment i imagine there could be a way to filter the usable nutrients out with a fish tank though been a few decades since ive been responsible for a tank full of fish but ive been musing about it lately simply because i like having fish and other aquatic creatures around after growing up around them if im ever ready to drop money into something that expensive id probably do more research into how to utilize it for gardening as well
DIY,not_removed,peppers love hot climates and would do just fine in something that large
DIY,not_removed,definitely good for tomatoes they get so thirsty in the region i live in it gets so hot that leaving the tomatoes for even a day without some sort of watering system can be enough to kill them another thing great about this kind of setup for tomatoes is that the consistent amount of water they are getting helps prevent the cracking that can happen when they experience drier periods followed by heavy rain consistent availability of water helps to prevent that
DIY,not_removed,why is this better than just watering it with a watering can
DIY,not_removed,why doesnt the water just spill out of the neck holes though
DIY,not_removed,cool thanks
DIY,not_removed,so you would fill up the reservoir until the water comes into contact with the soil at the little holes drilled into the top and capillary action moves the water high enough for the plants to get to it
DIY,not_removed,i wouldnt say hes tightly wound as you came off very strong youre completely wrong this is an alarmist post with nothing to back it up you havent done your research why youre wrong below the dude had a legitimate concern and you responded poorly all you had to do was say hey heres the sources saying this is fine he even said he liked the idea and wanted to try it out himself
DIY,not_removed,lol i do not think they meant the litter box but the plastic container that the litter comes in you know the one you buy from the store to fill your cats litter box still laughing though
DIY,not_removed,thank you the pvc idea seems extremely simple and im excited to try it in my next grow everyone loves some dank tomatoes
DIY,not_removed,great idea also i plan to plant rosemary and salvia which are typical of the place
DIY,not_removed,to add to what the op said it can promote deep root growth and since the very top remains dry reduces the amount of weeding you have to do
DIY,not_removed,there are several answers to this it helps to prevent the spread of disease to the plants many of the fungal or bacterial diseases that go after plants are spread from droplets from watering from the top such as a watering can or rain another reason is just cutting down actual labor i dont have to add water as frequently with a reservoir it gets very hot here in the summer and plants with regular trays instead of water reservoirs sometimes have to be watered multiple times per day the type of plants i use these reservoirs for are very thirsty ones slower growing plants that arent as thirsty dont need something like this though
DIY,not_removed,no the reservoir would have to stay full for that to work i wouldnt put holes in the top id put them on the side so water could seep out of the reservoir when the soil is not completely saturated and then rise up there are premade pots with reservoirs that work pretty well the reservoirs are a bit small though especially for water intense plants like tomatoes i use some of those as well as a large diy planter box with pvc pipes for a reservoir
DIY,not_removed,soil can be too sandy and be too shitty for even irrigation planters you cannot plant carnivorous plants in compost try again all my peat moss is sustainably sourced
DIY,not_removed,it really depends on what youre growing but if you look at the context to the comment youre replied to i was discussing what somebody should do if their soil was so sandy it flowed through tiny holes like an hour glass there is a lot of debate over the use of peat and i wont get into that here but there are tons of things you can amend soil with if it is too sandy not sandy enough etc
DIY,not_removed,just had an opportunity to follow up on this lol yes the ones you buy the litter innot the damn potty box itself i am laughing hysterically though not sure why im find it so funny
DIY,not_removed,damn right well worth the effort
DIY,not_removed,interesting thanks
DIY,not_removed,how do you know when the reservoir is empty
DIY,not_removed,some two inch pipes built into a square configuration or somesuch
DIY,not_removed,dipstick that is use an actual dipstick to check the level no insult intended
DIY,not_removed,other plans include putting a ping pong ball in the fill tube as a gauge
DIY,not_removed,you can see the reservoir through the water bottle inlet
DIY,not_removed,the box is long and narrow so i just put two pipes side by side and connected them at one end they have a very slight slope to them it isnt the best configuration it tends to work better at the end where there is the vertical portion to fill it on one pipe and an end cap on the other so i just put the plants that require more water at that end i could have put a tee in it to make it a continuous loop if i had though if it at the time most of the year we get enough rain that i dont use the reservoir but it is good for when i go on vacation and in the middle of summer
DIY,not_removed,you literally cannot plant carnivorous plants in anything other than nutritionally devoid planting material or else the roots burn and rot away in days sphagnum moss peat moss is one of the widely accepted easy planting mediums because of how airy and nutritionally devoid it is you obviously dont know what youre talking about so it might be time to stop talking
DIY,not_removed,peat moss has almost no nutritional value for plants its a texture enhancer when you need to fluff things up a bit and nothing more carnivorous plants like it because they need very poor soil they evolved to get what they needed from the bugs they eat and cant handle much more ecologically peat moss is completely awful it comes from bogs where sphagnum has been decomposing for a ridiculously long time there is no such thing as renewable peat moss coconut coir is a good substitute if youre looking for similar properties
DIY,not_removed,but there is grow your own its ridiculously simple and takes nothing but a bag of water if youre lazy and dont like things to look nice sphagnum moss grows relatively quickly at least for our own needs bought a flat and have provided our own ever since sell extra when we have too much
DIY,not_removed,the burning is from a nutritional issue because carnivorous plants cannot take nutrition through its root system without damaging the root system i dont know why youre arguing about something you obviously dont know a lot about my boyfriend raises carnivorous plants for sale and you couldnt be more wrong so far unless you said to raise them in straight fertilizer
DIY,not_removed,peat moss from peat bogs is different from fresh sphagnum this is like you handing me a whole chicken and telling me that its the same as dry bones
DIY,not_removed,unscrewed the seat from the frame and threw it out and that was your first mistake now you have to take apart another one to get a pattern also i dont mean to sound rude but this is diy not buy it yourself you are probably in the wrong sub

DIY,not_removed,have you looked at pictures of fireplaces on the net it is purely a judgement call what looks best to you and your family is what should be done in years past it was traditional to have hearth in front of the firebox because wood will eject flaming embers you needed something noncombustible to catch them dont think that is going to be a problem in your case looks like you are installing an electric or gas unit so if you want the carpet up to the base by all means do it
DIY,not_removed,are you going to have a tile section on the floor around the fireplace u just have to decide how this will butt up against the stone because the front edge of the is not flat i think it would be best if the floor went in and then the stone went on top and it would meet up nicely
DIY,not_removed,im putting carpet to the base my question is about the bottom row of stone should it sit on floor or be slightly elevated so the carpet can be installed underneath
DIY,not_removed,i personally have never seen carpet go under stone but i suppose it has been done ive always put tack strips around the perimeter of the brick and ran the carpet up against it to each his own i guess
DIY,not_removed,i have a x foot doggie box in my back yard i put down some landscape tarp and covered the area with pine bark chips
DIY,not_removed,i would skip on the gravelyou will have the same problem with urine smell bark mulch is a better option because it will absorb the urine and the bottom layers decompose over timeyou can replenish the mulch every year or so the wetter the area the fast it breaks down
DIY,not_removed,get western red cedar mulch it has a lovely scent dont get it from a box store go to a landscape supply placethey sell it by the yard for around a yard here in canada i would do around inches for good absorption
DIY,not_removed,yescedar bunch mulch is my favouritebest smelling too
DIY,not_removed,bark chips how very appropriate
DIY,not_removed,is bark mulch a type of mulch how thick of a layer would you recommend
DIY,not_removed,httpsimgurcomgalleryeszes
DIY,not_removed,i think youre right
DIY,not_removed,whyd you attach it to the house instead of another post
DIY,not_removed,all credit to this design goes to uamodernmaker he is a very creative designer and i needed a new gate here is his original build video
DIY,not_removed,with all your hinge pins pointing up someone could simply lift and remove the gates pretty quickly usually you see the upper pins pointing up and you hang the gate brace it and then set the lower pins in facing down and tack them in place nice work all in all tho there are any number of ways you can secure the gates now if that is a concern
DIY,not_removed,i love the black contrast beautiful
DIY,not_removed,rdiy truly a gateway sub
DIY,not_removed,wow what a gate good job
DIY,not_removed,thats a good way to plan building it beefy once is better than building times over any other way
DIY,not_removed,is the fence donald trump approved
DIY,not_removed,hops weld wire fence
DIY,not_removed,great work man awesome that you welded up all the hardware tooreminds me of the time i saw two guys stealing a gate quite similar to this one i didnt do anything about it though because i was worried that theyd take a fence
DIY,not_removed,most redittors make me want to build a gate
DIY,not_removed,wow cool gate is there a reason for the uneven sides or is that for design either way it looks great
DIY,not_removed,that looks great very well done
DIY,not_removed,excellent build you inspire others here and thats the whole point keep o diying and post more
DIY,not_removed,these look awesome i wouldnt consider it overkill its gonna last a long time
DIY,not_removed,looks great looks photoshopped in actually because of how new it looks and the sharp black border
DIY,not_removed,nice
DIY,not_removed,i like this gate this is the best gate this gate will block great things
DIY,not_removed,how deep is the post buried i see this sagging from the torque applied by the gate
DIY,not_removed,how deepwide is the footing for the wood post
DIY,not_removed,looks great what size of square tube did you use
DIY,not_removed,this is awesome i was pretty confused for a minute by the post cap because the depth perception made it look like it wasnt hollow inside this looks fantastic well done
DIY,not_removed,this looks really nice and the grain of the wood really blends well with the trees around it nice job on the welds as well
DIY,not_removed,nice work this is giving me ideas i have a gate that i need to replace what did you use to sealprotect the wood from the elements
DIY,not_removed,because the footer of the garage would not allow me to bury it very deep also there is a buried pvc drain pipe nearby that would get in the way so it was the only option
DIY,not_removed,now you need to do the fencing too that fancy gate is making your wired fence look like a chicken cage
DIY,not_removed,yeah i did it that way so i could lift them off if i needed to i also thought about someone coming and taking them the ability to open it wide and lift off the hinges seems redundant either do one or the other i should figure out a way to secure it better this was the hardest part for me to figure out and make myself
DIY,not_removed,thanks i had no idea it would turn out this way but the more i look at it the more i like it too
DIY,not_removed,i see what you did there
DIY,not_removed,indeed thanks for noticing i will secure it and post pics later
DIY,not_removed,thanks very much not my design but i had a blast building it
DIY,not_removed,absolutely im not a fan of chincy cheap or otherwise underrated building materials
DIY,not_removed,lol future project
DIY,not_removed,thank you very much good news is there hasnt been a rash of gate theft in my neighborhood however i am going to tack a washer on top to keep them from being lifted
DIY,not_removed,i was worried that theyd take a fence ba boom ching
DIY,not_removed,do it and dont look back
DIY,not_removed,e the small side for getting a lawn mower through and the larger side opens if i need to get my trailer or any heavy equipment to the backyard
DIY,not_removed,thank you very much cheers
DIY,not_removed,indeed thanks very much
DIY,not_removed,thanks very much that was the plan
DIY,not_removed,my wife said the same thing
DIY,not_removed,my hope it blocks great and notsogreat things
DIY,not_removed,its deep and it is deflecting from the weight of the gate i shimmed it at the bottom to account for this
DIY,not_removed,i dug a dia hole that is deep then mixed and poured an bag of concrete in the hole then filled and compacted the rest with fill dirt
DIY,not_removed,square tubing
DIY,not_removed,wow thank you for the compliment i thought about buying a metal post cap but at the point to where i built the hardware and hinges i just said screw it try and build one the gate is far from perfect and if i did it again i would do a few things better
DIY,not_removed,thank you very much the materials really make the beauty i just put them together
DIY,not_removed,well its cedar to begin with so you technically dont need anything but i used thompsons water seal i chose cedar because its lighter than pressuretreated pine
DIY,not_removed,youre right i will report back next week and let you know if its still standing
DIY,not_removed,gates obviously not double wide ones should be hinged on a structure vs on a post this is almost always the better option as they have more strength and dont move like a post if your house cant hold a gateyou need a new house
DIY,not_removed,indeed its already in planning
DIY,not_removed,drill out the pins and use a luggage lockor a clevis pin and tack that or run a small bolt through and locktite a nut to that or mushroom the top of the pins nit picking it really is a smart looking and functioning gate
DIY,not_removed,i was worried that theyd take a fence well at least one person got it hahaha
DIY,not_removed,thanks
DIY,not_removed,awesome thanks
DIY,not_removed,out of curiosity did you seal the wood before or after fastening it to the frame assume before
DIY,not_removed,ok great thanks for the suggestion i wanted to ask others here how they would do it and youve given me exactly what i needed
DIY,not_removed,correct before but you could easily do it in place

DIY,not_removed,id make and install some cross bracing for the sides so that you form some triangles you could experiment with paint stir sticks glued together to give yourself sufficient length and installed with small screws to figure out what works and will look ok
DIY,not_removed,the wood probably dried and the screws are now loose id size some washers to go under the screws two reasons you can tighten more against a washer and avoiding crushing the wood and it distributes the force further out from the center so the assembly pulls together
DIY,not_removed,you need angular bracing other than improving the stability of the joints thats the way to add shear strength it would be pretty easy to add some tensioned cables from corner to corner on the sides wire rope eye bolts wire rope clips turnbuckles electrical shrink wrap to make it look neat alternatively add some triangular gussets in the back corners of the sides top and bottom ply say on the square sides
DIY,not_removed,as in bracing on each shelf and each side or one giant brace on each side it might look better on each shelf but at the end of the day it needs whichever will give the best structural integrity the sides of the legs are flush with the legs where the front the legs stick out a bit here is a pic of the side httpsimgurcomafklbp
DIY,not_removed,i am not sure if the screws being loose would be the case as it was just built but i will try putting some washers on as that could be a really easy fix i will let you know
DIY,not_removed,tried adding washers to the screws and did not seem to help the sway
DIY,not_removed,im not skilled enough to predict ahead of time what will work and look best thats why i suggest experimenting with paint sticks or any longish scraps you have once you know what will work and is acceptable lookswise you can decide how much youre willing to do to integrate the bracing into your unit so it looks like its part of the original design since you know how to dado and rabbet im sure you can figure out an approach that will work
DIY,not_removed,you need to seal the concrete if it has not been sealed does it look like it has clear paint on it does water bead or soak into the concrete surface if it soaks in you need to seal it those self stick pads do not stick to porous surfaces worth a damn and unsealed concrete is porous as hell the mention of paint is silly you can but a good concrete sealer and roll it on for about half the price but you need to do this or plan on your tiles forever coming loose hope it helps
DIY,not_removed,i have always used henry bond enhancer when ive put down the vinyl tiles it just seems to make the surface a little tackier especially on a porous surface like concrete and improves the adhesion ive never once had a tile unstick when ive primed first
DIY,not_removed,it really depends try sticking one down if it stick well you should be fine but if it loose go ahead and use an epoxy sealent like this one
DIY,not_removed,i had no problem laying self stick tiles on bare concrete but i didnt know about the bond enhancer sounds like good stuff the biggest problem i ran in to was little unseen stones under the tile i would have to pull the tile up and pluck out the stone if i did it again i would blast the area where the next tile goes with some air from an air compressor
DIY,not_removed,i have inch vinyl tiles in my sons bedroom that have been down for years and vinyl tiles in a large family room and my living room that have been down about years i did not seal any room and i havent had a single problem in any room im in las vegas
DIY,not_removed,thats impressive and all but i just put bottled water for gallons in a little fry daddy set on simmer for a few hours works like a charm
DIY,not_removed,thanks nice photos you dont see much hvac work here so its good to see some examples
DIY,not_removed,where were you hours ago when i started hacking and slashing into my furnace
DIY,not_removed,where can you get gallons of bottled presumably purifieddeionized water for i have a homemade house humidifier made from two greenhouse ultrasonic transducers combined output around gallons a dayrun them both for a few minutes in the tub and the whole bathroom is filled with a fog but i cant actually use it because i have hard tapwater and cant afford to buy filtered water in the quantities that id need for this thing one of these days ill write an rtifu about the day i tested it
DIY,not_removed,thanks it was actually relatively fun to do
DIY,not_removed,lol that made my morning i spit out my coffee now i need a new keyboard thanks
DIY,not_removed,i got the gallon water dispenser mine is called primo at wally world and picked up a spare bottle we have those glacier water dispenser stations all around the neighborhood for gallons and its practically purified to distilled state i can run my fry daddy at a low simmer just cycling on and off with steam coming off of it no bubbles making it to the surface i will go through about a gallon in hours and if it runs dry it just stays at the same temp doesnt go over the simmer temp i can turn it on fill it up and go to bed and when i wake up its dry but its set at such a low temp i dont worry about risk of fire i run it in the laundry room by the furnace air intake and it circulates through the entire house i keep it on the dryer with nothing flammable around it i have sq ft and if i run it continually in the worst of the winter i can get the house humid enough that ice will form on the windows i usually just run it when i am home and pull the magnetic plug when i leave the house and my hygrometer stays in the comfortable zone of the hygrometer was a wally world pick up too less than it sits on the furnace thermostat in the hallway the bonus is i dont have to worry about wasting water decalcifying anything or modifying my furnace duct work i can run the fry daddy for about a week pick it up when it dries out wash it in the sink in about seconds and put it back in service
DIY,not_removed,thanks looks like i need to make a trip to wally world

DIY,not_removed,ah yes good point thanks and sorry
DIY,not_removed,small simple and elegant beautifully done it looks great
DIY,not_removed,looks great almost exactly like out kids bathroom before shot that we are looking to remodel mind if i ask the general out of pocket cost
DIY,not_removed,looks awesome remodeled bathrooms add so much to a residence nicely done sir
DIY,not_removed,nice work unfortunately you should have waterproofed that hardibacker with a membrane like red or green guard cement board on its own is not waterproof
DIY,not_removed,very nice
DIY,not_removed,id say roughly the vanity w top was the tiling was another tub was toilet and then other misc stuff was probably about
DIY,not_removed,assuming that the hole is the correct height above the stove determined by code and manufacturer recommendations you should be able to find a modern hood that will work with that location you might have to do a little research to make sure that the hole lines up horizontally with the output of the hood they arent necessarily centered theyre not difficult to install i put one in by myself in an afternoon and that included cutting a hole through cabinets and the side of the house and running the duct work the most difficult obstacle i see is dealing with the potentially ungrounded wiring if it is ungrounded you would likely need to run new wiring to get it up to code
DIY,not_removed,cant open the picture
DIY,not_removed,i dont see a good easy solution putting the duct in the wall and using a range hood would not be overly difficult i would be willing to walk you through it
DIY,not_removed,they still make throughwall exhaust fans something like but agree with umisternoggin about the ungrounded wiring i have a similar fan in my old unrenovated awful kitchen we just pulled it out and cleaned the grease off it and it still works fine
DIY,not_removed,if your house has a ground then it is likely this does also whatever the case your wiring would not be less safe because of changing the fan
DIY,not_removed,in that case youre not likely to do much better than the fan thats in there id fix the chain and call it good
DIY,not_removed,your second link still doesnt work
DIY,not_removed,yeah unfortunately that style of fan is going to move a limited volume of air and doesnt have the hood to help capture smoke vapor and grease so its not going to be very effective ive had one before and it did virtually nothing
DIY,not_removed,which kind of algae do you have are the parameters okay what are you doing to prevent the algae

DIY,not_removed,idk anything about pools girlfriend does it all i just sweet it its like brownish along the sides she uses chlorine and shocks it from time to time not quite sure what that even means lol
DIY,not_removed,okay if its brown algae shocking may not solve the problem brown algaemustard algae is resistant to chlorine so she need to have the water adjusted to the correct parameters then brush its a must the algae so you can break to loosen it from the walls and bottom and then shock the pool very aggressively and treat with algaecide if its a lot of algae you may need to vacuum it out of the pool after brushing it and using floc
DIY,not_removed,its been my experience that the self leveling stuff is not resilient at all it chips and scrapes off with force that might just barely need noticeable on actual concrete its more like the texture of grout youd want a minimum of a thick hard epoxy over it
DIY,not_removed,i did flooring for years the self leveling cement is not very durable
DIY,not_removed,have done this several ways use a concrete sealer or epoxy sealer or epoxy paint works excellent used to do this all the time for chemical damage and wear and tear at large factories
DIY,not_removed,iv seen in a couple diy shows that say never use self levelling cement for your basement the reason iirc is that basements are an area prone to flooding therefore need drainage with self levelling you do not have proper guidance for the water to go to the sump pumpdrains just a thought i could be completely wrong though
DIY,not_removed,i would call sika and see if they sell an epoxy to seal it
DIY,not_removed,i dont see why not you put it down right and as long as you seal it right its not too different from regular concrete
DIY,not_removed,sealed and polished cement floors are popular with the industrial crowd
DIY,not_removed,i really liked how mine looked i poured the self leveling compound before i set my tile in the bathroom im not sure about water though might want to ask a concrete guy about sealing it you just reminded me to hook up and check my heated floors installed them a year ago and havent hooked them up yet
DIY,not_removed,rust oleum has a few high grade epoxy sealers for industrial and commercial installs
DIY,not_removed,heres a product that you can do this w httpswwwduraamencompselflevelingconcrete
DIY,not_removed,great question i want to do the same thing at my house the self leveler looks awesome but nobody is willing to say whether it will work or not i think it is because nobody had done it to test i say go for it and then let me know if it works in a year so i can finally finish my kitchen
DIY,not_removed,any product you can recommend
DIY,not_removed,can you pour a self leveling layer and then add tile atop it
DIY,not_removed,even with a good epoxy applied on it
DIY,not_removed,any particular epoxy sealer you would recommend
DIY,not_removed,some floors arent sloped towards the drain anyways like the floor in my basement where the only drain is the sump basin which is in the highest corner of the floor i need to pump leaked in water to the basin with a dehumidifier
DIY,not_removed,it is nothing like concrete
DIY,not_removed,no mate self leveller is far to soft and is much more probes to chips and scratches and other damage it is not designed to be a final finish for a floor
DIY,not_removed,if i keep it as is without tiling i would definitely need to seal it anyting you would recommend
DIY,not_removed,sadly just pouring and manually leveling is your best bet dont be tempted to over water the concrete
DIY,not_removed,i see comes in clear you might look into garage floor paint specifically clear epoxy
DIY,not_removed,thats actually what the self leveling concrete is for an underlayment for other types of flooring it is strong but not a wearable surface meaning it will wear away quickly if not covered
DIY,not_removed,not anymore you would be wise to call a concrete contractor that works with dairies or other facilities that have potent chemical use and ask them what brand is local that protects their work
DIY,not_removed,care to elaborate
DIY,not_removed,i dont know though if its sealed right if it wouldnt withstand residential foot traffic
DIY,not_removed,i wouldnt know ive never left it bare
DIY,not_removed,appreciate the info thank you
DIY,not_removed,concrete is made up of cement large aggregate small aggregate water and air this is a polymer based cementous product that has no large or small aggregate and likely has greater strength in sheer but less in compression it is like saying grout is like concrete it is not the same at all
DIY,not_removed,reminds me of an old family story as a kid my uncle drops something on the sidewalk refers to the sidewalk as being made of cement grandfather says thats not cement thats concrete uncle asks whats concrete made of grandfather replies cement aggregate and water uncle then asks whats cement made of and my grandfather launched into a half hour long lecture about different types of cement
DIY,not_removed,so that being said would you then recommend to avoid using only this floor and keep going with the small layer of concrete on top of it
DIY,not_removed,that is not a good story
DIY,not_removed,they never said it was good just old
DIY,not_removed,op heard that story about his uncle and thought it was so interesting that he remembered it makes you wonder for how many generations that story can survive in his family
DIY,not_removed,i never said it was bro
DIY,not_removed,i get that i just found it amusing that such an inane little event with no payoff or anything actually memorable at all about it could live long enough in anyones mind to become an old story
DIY,not_removed,if a story is rare
DIY,not_removed,maybe she has fond memories of their grandpa going on long diatribes or something everyone remembers little things that most people would find dumb p
DIY,not_removed,those are water stains if there is clearly no leak you should seal the ceiling surface with a sealer such as kilz original or coats with the latex kilz or some other primersealer intended to seal stains water stains will bleed through paint as you have seen dont skimp on the sealer
DIY,not_removed,there would be no water marks without water on the drywall from above do you need to caulk where the tub meets the floor is there any grout cracked or missing at the floor was the grout sealed with a sealant what is above the tub plastic walls are the corners glued down and caulked properly are there seems of the plastic that appear to be meeting fine but are letting in small amounts of water how far is the toilet from this location perhaps the wax seal is no longer functioning properly figure out what the hell is going on in the bathroom before you attend to the water marks below the horse belongs in front of the cart oil base primers are one option to be rolled on with a roller brushed or sprayed cleans up with paint thinner and this you could also again only when everything is totally dry use an alcohol based primer to seal the water marks this product can also be rolled brushed or sprayed on cleans up with ammonia edit cover everything below when using primer products with plastic or old sheets edit grout sealers drip drip
DIY,not_removed,upload the photos to httpimgurcomupload and post the link here
DIY,not_removed,water stains
DIY,not_removed,what is on the level above that sitting roomkitchen a bathroom perhaps leaking toiletshowersink is a possibility if its on the top floor leaking roof maybe in any case find out what is causing the stain before trying to cover it uppaint over it
DIY,not_removed,httpimgurcomaiullz
DIY,not_removed,one more thing is there a window next to the tub that might be improperly caulked or sealed from the outside that when even closed could be allowing water to enter the home during certain storms
DIY,not_removed,httpimgurcomaiullz heres a link for a photo of the ceiling above the area is a bathroom with a bath tub as far as i know there are no leaks

DIY,not_removed,if you are using rockwool then you will need to construct a stud frame to support it if you use pir pur eps or similar you can bond it or drill and screwed in with thermally broken fixings
DIY,not_removed,this is really awesome what can you charge for a repair like this

DIY,not_removed,she had warranty so free kinda sucks for me but i dont mind to much found in there so thats something i guess
DIY,not_removed,better than nothing
DIY,not_removed,i mean its installed but i wouldnt really call it clean
DIY,not_removed,i see an prefuse positive cable running unprotected over a stamped metal battery bracket you might want to fix that before it chafes through and potentially sets your battery box on fire
DIY,not_removed,aww man title looked capitalised when i was writing it
DIY,not_removed,came here to say that
DIY,not_removed,yeah couple things to note i used the amp because it was one i had laying around and i dont really have money to spend buying a new one and i wanted to make a video showing how to install a sub and amp i do mention in the video the importance of matching your sub and amp correctly i also mention that if you bridge an amp be sure to follow the manual because they have the correct way to bridge them for the appropriate use this amp for instance is designed to at the least work with a sub at a low power output so i dont put it up too loud and the heatsink is beafy as fuck and doesnt get hot also there is an ac vent under the seat to keep it chilled the thing with the shorting of the wires is completely true and i always use some tape to insulate them however i didnt mention that in the video and ill be putting in annotation asap because i realise how people could be under the false impression that it is safe to leave them bare thanks for pointing that out
DIY,not_removed,thats more a problem with the amp i used and the fact that the stock one was under there too its one i had laying around in any other car it would be much cleaner even with it sticking out a little its much cleaner than in the boot tho
DIY,not_removed,serves me right for being too lazy to undo one bolt haha na ill fix it in the morning should be easy af thanks for spotting it edit gonna add more of the sleaving and run it under the bracket
DIY,not_removed,wrong account
DIY,not_removed,your fuse really should be as close to the terminal as possible
DIY,not_removed,hahaha forgot my password so i couldnt log into the app decided to make a new acc
DIY,not_removed,yeah theres a reason car manufacturers tend to put the fuse box right next to the positive terminal
DIY,not_removed,fyi the link shows the dark spots

DIY,not_removed,looks nice if you like the color tone i think it looks good it doesnt need stain but i would hit it with a few coats of poly the poly will make it a little more durable and have a nicer finish without ruining the look maybe a semigloss polycrylic
DIY,not_removed,looks a bit fragile jk looks good
DIY,not_removed,i would have stenciled fragile on the side in red pain
DIY,not_removed,this looks great well done
DIY,not_removed,this is amazing might have to try it
DIY,not_removed,no poly or other finish
DIY,not_removed,this looks cool did you think of staining the wood at all i would like to try something like this
DIY,not_removed,i dont know french
DIY,not_removed,the utmost basics haha literally lesson or in a beginners book practicing scales as well
DIY,not_removed,ah genius i may do that haha
DIY,not_removed,thank you still learning how to use the tools next thing i want to practice is the use of joints
DIY,not_removed,not yet baby steps
DIY,not_removed,ya ive thought about it some of the pieces look pretty new and bright so id like to bring those down a few shades
DIY,not_removed,italian not frenchlol
DIY,not_removed,i did think of that when looking at this side table but it has its magical touch you know the simplicity is what i love in this and youve recycled i always used to but my furniture but ever since going this subreddit i am much more likely to start building too
DIY,not_removed,do those help seal it
DIY,not_removed,easy cheap and effective nice job with the box having all that crap on the floor must have been bugging the hell out of you
DIY,not_removed,damnit good catch lol
DIY,not_removed,depends on the age of baby some have more baby oil inside
DIY,not_removed,this is a neat experiment if i understand your methodology correctly it looks like the prestain conditioner makes the stain lighter but doesnt really improve the evenness any it actually looks like handsanding was the biggest improvement i try to avoid using a power sander on anything im going to stain because ive always had a hard time getting the swirls out when im done i use my random orbit on stuff im giving a surface film finish or paint but if im staining ill stick with a sanding block and only sand in the direction of the grain that way any scratches blend in with the figure of the wood as an aside the sandpaper gumming up might be from the residue of the factory finish with clean wood that doesnt usually happen either way you can get big blocks of rubber for cleaning sandpaper or use an eraser as a few people noted in the first thread staining tightgrained woods sucks hard or soft doesnt matter but anything with a smooth even surface tends to stain badly there are workarounds to get halfacceptable results from pigmented oil stain like minwax but as youve found its not ideal sometimes a gel stain will absorb more evenly but its ultimately the same thing you can get better results from alcohol dyes hard to find in stores easy to find online or with colored surface films shellac works well but isnt super durable ive also heard that minwax polyshades widely and justifiably despised by woodworkers can give a really nice result if you thin the color out by mixing one part polyshades with two or three parts clear polyurethane the good news is no matter what you decide to do you can sand the stain back off mineral spirits will also help pull some of the color out but its not a miracle having used prestain conditioner will probably help in both endeavors since it will have limited how far the stain penetrated
DIY,not_removed,looking at the untouched area i can see theres already a pretty fair bit of color variation to the wood you might just be highlighting that with the stain try wiping that area with just mineral spirits and take a picture while its still wet if it has the same blotchiness as the stained area then its the wood not anything youre doing my other question is was this wood totally untreated when you purchased it do they sell furniture that way i usually expect a coat of varnish or poly at least if thats the case i feel you may not have removed all of the previous treatment before attempting to stain
DIY,not_removed,i just bought this desk top and im thinking of oiling it with danish oil poly or tung oil how did yours turn out in the end any additional advice
DIY,not_removed,im still waiting to borrow a belt sander to take a good amount off the top and try again so no haha birch is notoriously​ hard to stain supposedly im going to give it one more go after i sand it down pretty far and then put a darker stain on it
DIY,not_removed,good luck please let me know how it turns out i will be following in your footsteps this month by that i mean questioning why im trying to stain birch
DIY,not_removed,good to know ill keep you updated

DIY,not_removed,wee bit normal sized sheds are about a year in taxes ok no big deal a single car garage detached is about attached is generally
DIY,not_removed,this is insane every time i see a car that starts with a shell like that it never gets finished always sits in a garage for years to eventually be scrapped good to see someone follow through on such a nice car
DIY,not_removed,well done shes a sweet ride diggin the manual tranny save the manual
DIY,not_removed,that is absolutely gorgeous i love seeing these newer gbodies being restored
DIY,not_removed,ya take that stupid assed hood offgood job
DIY,not_removed,loved your build post malibu was my first car as well loved that thing drove it into the ground my friends called it the malibomber beautiful car
DIY,not_removed,only six months thats insane incredible job man
DIY,not_removed,i seem to remember these things being on the tree am i wrong
DIY,not_removed,love it these cars arent very popular in the hot rod realm but you made it your own and it looks fun to drive
DIY,not_removed,awesome
DIY,not_removed,nice paint
DIY,not_removed,any process shots for dealing with the rust and fixing the hole
DIY,not_removed,well writtendocumented and beautiful
DIY,not_removed,ive been thinking about doing a similar project for the last couple of years but dont have the space this looks incredible you cant believe how jelly i am right now
DIY,not_removed,that is awesome dude i have an malibu ive owned since i was now and have slowly been converting into a drag car i dont have enough money and time but someday it will be completed again looks great and take good care of that chevelle i mean malibu lol
DIY,not_removed,looks great nice job
DIY,not_removed,you could not have picked a better colour that is one sweeeeeet ride my man
DIY,not_removed,great job inspiring
DIY,not_removed,now most of use dont know how to do this kind of thing or have the money but i believe this is the way forward to stop waste we scrap so many cars that could be salvaged into something new if you take cars and make good one out of the parts think about how much less waste youd have good job op hope you are very happy with the project and have it for the rest of ya life
DIY,not_removed,that is rad i would love to get another had a for a few years it was a second car and sold it because the honda had more features power windows tint big stereo kid shit you know but didnt appreciate it as much back then as i would now
DIY,not_removed,my parents car that i learned to drive was a door malibu auto i think with one piece bench seats at the time it seemed lame and generic looking back what an understated cool ride these are mine was tone drab olive greenishtan hard to explain the colour of mine but it was horribly faded and patchy
DIY,not_removed,i have to admit that id probably would have switched and used the malibu to restore the monte carlo that malibu was in pretty bad shape but you pulled it through
DIY,not_removed,i drive a malibu and i want yours more
DIY,not_removed,growing up my parents had matching malibus this takes me back to being around my dad while he worked on them great job
DIY,not_removed,you should be cranking stickshifts and safety belts by cake good work btw
DIY,not_removed,what a lovely restoration job especially the paint job so smooth and even true labour of love that ive never done one myself but my cousin restores classic cars for a living and my dad did a few for fun so i have many happy memories of childhood weekends spent scrounging for suitable parts in scrapyards
DIY,not_removed,this style car is dominating car shows these days i love every minute of it
DIY,not_removed,i am very jealous of you doing this i see my first car sitting a couple of blocks from my house and drive past it daily wishing i could do what you just did well done
DIY,not_removed,i love it
DIY,not_removed,good job op enjoy
DIY,not_removed,six mos my ass six years
DIY,not_removed,should have kept the hood
DIY,not_removed,money
DIY,not_removed,yeah that is awesome i remember when i was and tried to take two subaru and make one working car out of them that was not awesome
DIY,not_removed,thank you i had a great time doing it it was great getting ups deliveries of new parts all the time the day it was painted was like christmas for me
DIY,not_removed,thanks the manual trans was a must have for the project it makes me feel more in tune with the car much easier to blip the throttle for unnecessary noise at stop lights
DIY,not_removed,thank you i was astonished how many parts are available for these back in the day hurst olds grand nationals and monte ss were the ultimate
DIY,not_removed,i wasnt a big fan of the exaggerated cowl hood either thanks
DIY,not_removed,it went faster than i expected im an at home parent who used to run a repair shop i was home all day all summer with the kids i worked on it constantly
DIY,not_removed,to the best of my knowledge gbodies from year they downsized to year offered with a manual trans were all floor mounted automatics were column shiftedi do not know about previous year malibus
DIY,not_removed,unfortunately the monte was actually in really nice shape i took dash heater box seats seat belts door panels headliner backing window regulators door latches driveshaft front wheel well liners pitman arm instruments etc it supplied clips screws and it was a great wiring and assembly reference windshield reveal molding cowl trim hood stops coil springs hood hinges bright cowl trim i felt bad about destroying it it was openly advertised for sale for a long time at a low price in a city of well over nobody wanted it and i got it for it saved me many times that amount i would have gladly traded it to anyone with a malibu in similar condition
DIY,not_removed,it makes me sad i wanted one of those as my first car
DIY,not_removed,i have about photos of the project i wanted to make the posts album as short as reasonable so it wasnt too boring to view i dont consider myself to be knowledgeable or experienced at bodywork or welding i would recommend youtube videos from more experienced body shop guys my experience is in mechanical repairs
DIY,not_removed,thanks these things do eat up a bunch of money even when you do most of the work yourself
DIY,not_removed,let me explain in the late i was young i worked at a ground round as an obnoxious line cook harassing the waitstaff goofing off with friends cute girlfriend no actual responsibility just freedom cheeseburgers and rock and roll it all happened with a malibu my malibu if i restored anything else even if it was more popular valuable or easier the nostalgia wouldnt work it had to be a malibu
DIY,not_removed,six months i bought it sept started working april on the road the end of september im a stay at home parent who ran a repair shop for two decades i have time to burn and a full tool box
DIY,not_removed,i wasnt arguing your logic just the fact that that malibu was a really bad blank project to start with honestly you shouldve bought a one from socal texas arizona etc where theres no winter and no rain to speak off but theres always the next project in horizon isnt there
DIY,not_removed,i absolutely should have started with a better car once i got it home and apart it was much worse than i knew it was very close to going to the scrapyard
DIY,not_removed,was it always a ny car im surprised any car lasted years in the city they usually return to the earth long before that
DIY,not_removed,i really dont know i doubt it has been a regularly used street car for a long time
DIY,not_removed,i think this is pretty darn awesome but i must ask is it bright enough id be concerned itd be overly dim during dinner also how long from when the light switch is flipped on the wall until the lights turn on does the arduino have to boot up
DIY,not_removed,looks like its using thats quite a respectable amount for leds so it should be pretty darn bright
DIY,not_removed,nice if it was me id paint the support to match the rest
DIY,not_removed,nice my apartment gets really bored and could use an entertainment center for when im at work all day
DIY,not_removed,would this work in a house as well or only an apartment
DIY,not_removed,this is awesome
DIY,not_removed,gasp you didnt it was so simple and stunning and woodgrain before tsk tsk tsk what a sin
DIY,not_removed,thats really nice the handles are the perfect choice
DIY,not_removed,very nice i really get to appreciate diys especially when it comes to furnitures
DIY,not_removed,this is great moving soon and need an entertainment center parents are giving us at least one old dresser and i have tons of paint i believe i will give this a try i really like the paint handles and the top shelf for all the necessary tv boxes currently using a small side table to hold the tv and the wires drive me nuts nice job beautiful piece and you pretty much provide a step by step i can follow girl here with little tool experience thanks for the post love it
DIY,not_removed,i did this too but just set the tv on a dresser in our living room and converted the bottom broken drawer into a shelf with fold down face for the stereo and media bits

DIY,not_removed,looks good i did something very similar
DIY,not_removed,way too tall people hang tvs on ceilings practically so not surprised mine is about tall sorry just a huge pet peeve of mine
DIY,not_removed,seriously its killing me
DIY,not_removed,id have left the top natural along with the supports
DIY,not_removed,what are you even asking
DIY,not_removed,sure looks fine by itself but most likely didnt match up with anything else in the apartment it wouldnt make any sense to leave it like that and have it stand out like a sore thumb in contrast to the rest of the room
DIY,not_removed,do you have a pic of yours i feel like it would be a trip hazard more than anything
DIY,not_removed,dont act like you dont know about those house only dresserentertainment centers that spontaneously combust in apartments
DIY,not_removed,what would make sense would to be to start all over again with that dresser as the inspiration of theme
DIY,not_removed,i like the stand to be the same height of the couch httpimgurcomavmoeb some people like to sit in the first row of a movie theater i never understood it but do what you want obviously people do
DIY,not_removed,yeah ever since house apartment equipment is no longer supported it can cause some housing crashes
DIY,not_removed,it makes sense to throw out all of your furniture
DIY,not_removed,thats a decent setup i feel like if i were to recline all the way my feet would cover the screen
DIY,not_removed,still works for me i mean if you look up tv stands they tend to be under feet i used to have mine on a bookshelf that was about lazy and the lower is noticeably better imho got this on craigslist already assembled ikea for it goes for retail i dont sit all the way back i just did to test and it could be a toe or so in the way mine is maybe go

DIY,not_removed,did you buy instead of thats what it looks like youre going to put a lot of mud in those spots anyway since its technically a butt joint so its not a huge deal but its more work you can shim the studs behind it to bring it out to where you need it to be or just roll with it but do yourself a favor and countersink those screws if you leave it proud of the drywall its going to show through as a nail pop eventually
DIY,not_removed,put some screws in the old drywall a lot of it may just be floating because you cut it some of that may pull in a bit i wouldnt bother messing around with it beyond that get some min compound the stuff you mix not the premix mesh tape your joints and fill use a wide knife and feather it out ive filled worse
DIY,not_removed,furring strips behind the sheetrock on the studs you can get some precut strips at your local bigbox store or if you have a table saw just take some wood scraps and slice them up to make up the difference of the old and new sheetrock
DIY,not_removed,if that break is on the stud you might try putting a few screws into the old board to tighten it up a bit or you could shim the stud out a bit really that joint wouldnt be that hard to mud over just has to be a bit wider you are already using fiber tape so it should be ok
DIY,not_removed,shim it ive used a small piece of cardboard for a shim on a patch before and once its screwed down it doesnt have any flex and its really solid i just didnt want to deal with building up the joint compound so it made it just under flush with the existing wall
DIY,not_removed,i had a similar issue when i built a partition wall that extended off an existing finished wall about more or less difference between the new drywall and the old and it ran all the way from the top to the bottom feet i was able to use lightweight compound to feather it out eventually but it took a good out to get it right i probably could have gone even further and made it look better but ultimately its not very noticeable and its good enough for me
DIY,not_removed,if your new drywall is like that all the way around then you need or you can put strips oy wood down each stud make sure to add screws to edges of old drywall where you cut it you may find it gets a little closer once its screwed down tight if its still off get some old stuff may have been due to it being a garage wall fire rating
DIY,not_removed,where im at drywall is code for in the garage but there is no reason you can shim it

DIY,not_removed,picture of space for reference
DIY,not_removed,if youve done dirt bike and snowmobile engines the a little motor like that is a piece of cake just find a service manual and go to town theyre super easy
DIY,not_removed,it is possibly low compression if it is hard to start and runs better when warm maybe rings or valves get a compression tester and run it record readings add a few squirts of oilt into the cylinder and do it again if reading rise its an indicator your rings arent sealing properly the oil helps them temporariliy hold pressure better if the reading is still low look to your valves
DIY,not_removed,is the primer bulb in good condition or is it possibly dry rotted and allowing it to suck air
DIY,not_removed,work on mowers all the time re seat your valves first only takes an hour and costs a gasgett good luck
DIY,not_removed,thanks the oil trick is something i will try if you have worked on these and found it was a ring issue have you just done rings or piston and rings together did you hone the cylinder yourself
DIY,not_removed,one thing i did notice is the oil has stayed fairly clean and it doesnt use much oil at all i run it hour weekly and i expected it to get dirty faster with bad sealing rings make me think valves would you agree
DIY,not_removed,if youre going in to change rings you might as well get a piston and all related bearings while you are in rehoning is easy an auto shop should rent you the hone you can put into an electric drill make sure the rings you buy are oversized then insert them into the cylinder by themselves use the piston to square them up then gap them to the correct size with a file not while they are in the cylinder also consider renting a ridge reamer there will be a ridge at the top of the cylinder wall where the rings dont reach all the way to the top lastly hopefully it is the valves so yoy dont have to dig so deep
DIY,not_removed,yep also make sure that breather valve in the spring cover is rinsed out well and functioning sounds like valves
DIY,not_removed,you just need to hand wash them it wasnt sealed to begin with the heat mild abrasion of the dishwasher is stripping off the screen printed images i have a lot of vintage bar ware the stuff that we use every day looks fine because we only hand wash the printed glasses

DIY,not_removed,very nice
DIY,not_removed,no lead present
DIY,not_removed,box joint with a wooden dowel through the fingers since you cant use adhesive so youll need a table saw or a jigsaw and a drill
DIY,not_removed,some type of box joint or dovetail maybe
DIY,not_removed,dovetail joinery would be my suggestion honestly though it doesnt sound like youd have the skills equipment or tools to accomplish this

DIY,not_removed,nails
DIY,not_removed,look at japanese jointery pretty much everything is hand cut and no adhesive some of it requires a phd in mathematics lol but honestly i think the japanese joints are the best most of their year old temples and buildings are just joints no nails unless it was wooden
DIY,not_removed,do your own fucking homework
DIY,not_removed,thanks one thing that i will be able to do if you think it could work is pressfit a aluminum rod into the intersection of the wood pieces
DIY,not_removed,this
DIY,not_removed,thats what i was thinking i might have the budget for a couple sockethead cap screws or wood screws but i cant say for certain
DIY,not_removed,yeah im a total beginner but i was just thinking it could be an option to fix a design problem
DIY,not_removed,thanks for the help ill have to try this out
DIY,not_removed,the engineering students were given a bill of materials that limited what we can use unfortunately nails werent on that list
DIY,not_removed,did that really need to be said this is a help post for a reason
DIY,not_removed,a sockethead cap screw or wood screws re read the op title
DIY,not_removed,for the more complex joints sure there are tons of basic joints one can do
DIY,not_removed,yes do your own fucking homework
DIY,not_removed,ideally it would be no screws but i do have money in the budget for it if i need to sorry for the confusion
DIY,not_removed,a wood screw is like cents at ace
DIY,not_removed,cool thanks for the help
DIY,not_removed,yeah im making a wobbleroscillating air engine i might do a post here when it is done to show the steps what is the communitys general attitude toward the usage of cad
DIY,not_removed,assuming that is porcelain the stain may be removable with a low grade acid based cleaner it could take some time to work it out but it could come out toilet bowl cleaner may work or even the mr clean magic sponge could potentially help maybe even a little clr and an abrasive sponge
DIY,not_removed,bar keepers friend is magic
DIY,not_removed,this actually looks like hard water to me use clr or buy some lime away should do the trick good luck
DIY,not_removed,trisodium phosphate and a scouring stone or alternatively you can try gojo hand soap and a scouring stone seriously the clr or lime away should do it though
DIY,not_removed,httphomerepairaboutcomodinteriorhomerepairssremvruststainhtm found this link for more extensive stain removal
DIY,not_removed,i picked up some clr today ill let you all know how it goes tomorrow thanks
DIY,not_removed,the lshaped desk i had didnt have any legs but had a heavy lshaped bracket reaching about of the depth of the desk on the long side of the l and i had no problems with it sagging it also had rails to lie on mounted to the wall which definitely reduced flexibility and sagging
DIY,not_removed,i built a desk like this out of two older desks and i solved it like the other poster said in my case i used building straps like you use for assembling decks to reinforce the seam i used both straight and l shaped ones and its held up for around years of daily use no sagging
DIY,not_removed,when i built my desk similar to what youre talking about consists of salvaged metal l desk legs and plywood with solid wood edge banding i thought this would be a problem too my temporary solution was to glue up two and have that act as a leg until i had time to take proper care of it well that never happened and the leg is still there i had an imac sitting on the l part of the desk for months nothing happened the leg isnt even attached it just sits there i purposely cut it a bit large so that when it is in place it will get pushed into the carpet to keep it in place so what are your legs going to consist of i wanted to still do take my desk apart trash the squeaky legs i have and replace them with some from ikea actually i also want to raise my desk up a bit and was going to glue blocks of plywood to the leg mount points i never got to that either but the blocks would allow for longer screws to be used which would result in a sturdier desk since my monitor is mounted on the wall there is no weight on the desk at all i have my keyboard and mouse a lamp and speakers and thats it what kind of weight would you be looking at
DIY,not_removed,when you say reaching about of the depth of the desk on the long side do you mean straight from the back of the desk forward to the lip or along the diagonal at the point where the long and short meet that seems like the weakest spot its also the deepest point of the desk which is why i worry about it sagging
DIY,not_removed,im actually going to have a carpenter build it its very cheap here the only problem being that you have to be very precise in your specifications i would like an allwood desk probably pine body with an oak top so the legs would be solid wood its going to be pretty straightforward because i dont want drawers in the desk at my height they just rub the crotch and dont really need fancy sidepaneling or privacy paneling as the back will be against a wall so probably really just two tables kind of stuck together but hopefully without the legs at the inner part where they meet as far as weight im mainly worried about resting my arms on the desk leaning on it etc as i work i plan to have my monitor and keyboard on the long portion there might be an evenly distributed weight of a large pane of glass set on top looks nice plus its easier to keep clean than wood but im not convinced of this because of the ljoin there would be a glass seam where the long and short meet and that might be a problem
DIY,not_removed,if i recall correctly this is how it was the boards screwed to the wall were just scrap perhaps if l bracket number two is added number one can be moved further away from the short side wall
DIY,not_removed,this is awesome is this a traditional masonry heater exhaust gasses travel to the top before turning down to meet the chimney
DIY,not_removed,pretty wild ride op id love to see one of these in action is this scandinavian
DIY,not_removed,im sorry youre getting a lot of slack for the design i think you did a fantastic job and it looks great
DIY,not_removed,that looks hideous just my opinion
DIY,not_removed,just to note a few things which may not be evident even from all those pics the fireplace is where it is because its almost impossible to move a fireplace orientation once a houses chimneys have been built and the old fireplace ovens were built around it there was a fireplace right in that spot before my dad opened that doorway by demolishing the old ovens and fireplace back in the because they had cracked to the point of being a fire hazard if used theres something in excess of metric tons of rocks under those chimneys and the new fireplace to support their weight so no way in hell was i going to move the spot in fact im planning on removing that doorway all together in the future since its just a fad leftover from the times when every fashionable kitchen had to look like a bistro with bar tops and all also those white masonitesheet covered walls are going too the gap between their frame and timber wall harbors mice and rats floors need to be opened sanded painted and leveledthe whole south face of the house should be lifted as much as inches to get the timber frame level but we all need hobbies dont we
DIY,not_removed,over pics
DIY,not_removed,christ demo everything and start over
DIY,not_removed,it was but not the actual fireplace that was relatively fast easy the tiling is what took time and effort to get right every last piece of tile had to be cut from tile with a wet saw and then the tile edges were filed by hand to a degree angle i filed blisters on my palms just from doing that
DIY,not_removed,agreed op did an amazing job especially considering the degree of difficulty
DIY,not_removed,it should be obvious from the pics but yeah hot gasses first go up to top chamber and then circulate back down via side channels into bottom chamber from where they will exit through the chimney repairing the chimney top is going be one more project for next summer the upper end of the brick chimney is about as jagged as a trolls tooth and something like bricks layers shortened as a result which makes the draft in the fireplace poor on some days because the chimney is currently slightly too short as a result
DIY,not_removed,finnish and likely common in rest of scandinavia as well it was sold as a cheap diy alternative to ready built fireplaces that usually start from € or so with labor and cargo included on hind sight this one was also sold with labour and on hind sight € extra would had been actually rather cheap considering the amount of manual labor involved though i still would had had to fix that concrete and the wall and the rest first in any case edit
DIY,not_removed,its likely the because of the final image that is skewed due to problems with camera angle in rl the proportions in width between the two sections are equal
DIY,not_removed,the fun part its almost exactly like the one in the httprosendahlbgweeblycomletswarmhtml so basically theyre whining about commercial product but meh some people are just jealous i guess
DIY,not_removed,sure jugend art deco arent for everyone i didnt want one of those sugar cube fireplaces because i felt they wouldnt be fitting to a house that was brought to its current site in the timber frame itself is possibly over years old
DIY,not_removed,i think its a great way to restoreupdate the place hadnt ever heard of a fireplace like that before one that circulates hot air like that is it difficult to clean the carbon buildup from it
DIY,not_removed,and why the fuck should i do that
DIY,not_removed,for the record i know masons who are very good at their job its possible to get a beveled edge by holding the tile at an angle and using the side of the wet saw blade as a sander i dont know the level of skill required to not lose a finger but its a thought if theres ever a next time
DIY,not_removed,you only burn clean firewood in it its not a trash oven the fireplace is also in accordance with the new eufireplace efficiency directives its very easy to clean as it burns away the soot assuming you use properly kilned firewood and what remains are just scraped away from the vent at the bottom the first fireplace like this in northern europe was built in sweden somewhere around the mid by the treasurer of gustaphus adolphus the iii to his mansion who owned a glazed tile pottery factory in pomerania germany while they have been made in varying shapes sizes the air circulating principle of convectional heating has remained the same ever since google kaakeliuuni if you want more examples one of the oldest examples of this style are from turku castle where mini version was used to heat the sleeping chambers of the princess of poland and duchess and later queen of finland catherine jagellonica its dates to late i originally would have wanted one of those antique ones with prefabricated handpainted gold decorated frill tiles but theyre horribly expensive costing as much as €tile so i bought a diykit for a fraction of the price
DIY,not_removed,my machine had it as well but only by turning the table not the blade it self like in a table saw which made the cutter so clumsy to use that i didnt feel like even trying there was better cutter in hardware store that could had done it but the cost was about € which is way too much for a single job to buy it and even this cheaper one that i have already cost a € then again the current trend is gap for normal tiling and that fireplace is made with had i done it with i might had been able to fudge with the corners ie not needing to do the angles at all someone also proposed me to next time cut sheets from concrete board and glue those on the surface first and then put tiles on those sheets for instant straight faces for tiling that chimney side to bad he mentioned that when i was mostly done already but ill have to remember that trick the next time i need to tile something that needs leveling as much as this one
DIY,not_removed,thats really cool thanks for the info
DIY,not_removed,thanks i personally have never understood the angloamerican way of placing the chimney halfoutside and thus losing most of the heating capacity because of it but i guess its traditional and its not like they have real winters anyway where that heat might actually be needed
DIY,not_removed,now that i think about it it makes perfect sense to conserve heat that way with the heat transfer in fact the chimney in my house is mostly in my house just never put much thought into it before always thought of heat transfer between liquids and solids and liquids and liquids curses
DIY,not_removed,these are pretty efficient too burning around of firewoodday at the most which is enough to comfortably heat about room at winter
DIY,not_removed,much better than my first few good work if you want the stain to penetrate you can leave the wood in the stain for about days and itll soak all the way through with birch and oak at least only ones ive used other than that id recommend a superglue coat on the outside for durability and shine
DIY,not_removed,thats beautiful does the technique make it possible to carve designs into the wood
DIY,not_removed,very cool my cousins fiancé wants wood and titanium hes all about he titanium p
DIY,not_removed,that is brilliant as someone that rocks a wooden wedding ring i really appreciate it
DIY,not_removed,look awesome so i tried this myself a few months ago with terrible results every time i tried bending the strips of veneer they would just crack and break i was using cedar do you know if the type of wood makes a difference did you experience any cracking or did everything bend nicely right after boiling
DIY,not_removed,thanks yeah i would have liked if it was a bit darker so i may try leaving it in longer next time thanks for the suggestion i actually did put a coat of super glue on the outsidewanted to make sure it would last
DIY,not_removed,i have seen it done mostly with inlay designs crushed glass metals etc however it can be tricky due to the small size
DIY,not_removed,i came across this page for me everything bent very nicely after i boiled it
DIY,not_removed,ask the repair man if you can be his apprentice
DIY,not_removed,definetely clamps
DIY,not_removed,clamps clamps and clamps
DIY,not_removed,you need woodworking skills i suggest watching a youtuber named matthias wandel you wont need much in the way of tools to start but definately a bunch of clamps for sure and various handtools learn to sew a little too welcome to the shop brother
DIY,not_removed,sewing machine and upholstery tools i used to work in a furniture repair shop with different guys focusing on different stuff and the upholstery guy made more than the rest of the shop combined he would replace the foam and reupholster worn out furniture also do this as a side hustle dont quit your job until you get more money hustling than you made at work

DIY,not_removed,i made this desk after my back told me so the surface was originally a ship hatch i used black piping as the original base and then used piping to telescope within the pipe didnt forget the lube either the car jack is attached at both ends so it pushes up and pulls down the slab
DIY,not_removed,no idea
DIY,not_removed,how snug are the legs how did you get them snug
DIY,not_removed,not much space for air between the two in fact i had to return some pipes to home depot because some had a weld seam going down the inside impending the telescopic ability
DIY,not_removed,nice i might try this any tips
DIY,not_removed,first id try to repair the existing parts find someone who is a welder maybe they can figure out a solution if that wont work try to find an identical used one on ebay or craigslist cannibalize it for the parts you need if that wont work just buy a different used one on craigslist throw this one on the scrap heap and move on with your life
DIY,not_removed,honest question and without wanting to offend wtf happened to that thing year old that looks like it came from a sunken ship probably the titanic my cheap little festival grill about € is in better condition
DIY,not_removed,maybe you should have bought a grill cover
DIY,not_removed,this was about new and im disappointed at how quick it got ruined it was functional barely before i just took it apart to see what was needed for im still not able to get all the parts theres a drip pan thats not available but can probably figure something out what are your thoughts id rather not spend the extra but not sure this is worth the money to repair
DIY,not_removed,dont buy another ken more they are crap ive got one thats years old and paid or so for it its a hunk of shit looks great from the outside but the internals are toast buy a weber way better grill for the
DIY,not_removed,buy a traeger of something close you can do everything in that grill some of the best beef jerky ive ever had
DIY,not_removed,it looks like you left this one dirty and in the rain a bit if you dont have a good cover or nice place to put the grill after use to keep it dry i suggest you buy a cheaper one from walmart or something what would be the point of spending if it is just going to rot out again

DIY,not_removed,personally think sheet of any matter rial will be too light duty for your needs records as you know are heavy as hell i would use at least cdx plywood would have ledgers under the shelf lengths and glue pre drill and grabber screw all of it you need to put a solid back on it there you could use even particle board so space ledger space means you could get shelves per sheet roughly you will need sheets the extra will be for your dividers you may adjust the layout for the number you have left over key is to use a solid back glue ledgers and some grabber screws to keep it sturdy and square good luck hope it helps
DIY,not_removed,i too think is too thin unless youre using high quality plywood like a cabinet grade birch or something similar use otherwise you may be able to simplify the cabinet by using solid verticals for the horizontals use adjustable shelf supports unless youve done it before it may be hard for you to screwbrad nail those shelves that line up the shelf supports will resolve this i suppose you could alternate between removable and installed shelf hope this makes sense for the shelf supports either drill the wood and use the pegstyle or use the type that click into long perforated strips of steel as long as you use a solid piece of wood on the backer and make the horizontal shelves reasonably tight it should be plenty rigid for this project
DIY,not_removed,racking side to sideis something youre going to have to consider with a heavy load on top to keep it falling like a house of cards you may want to make the top cavity taller and put a piece of solid wood across the front and glue a inside the inner corners you can use a krieg pocket screws to help increase rigidity you can use hardboard for the back you would probably want to use vertical boards and adjustable peg pattern to be able to vary the shelf height structurally it wont matter too much which way you choose to do the long boards if your tolerance isnt shite but there is no real easy way to butt the joints cleanly without some fancy dados if you choose to keep the long boards horizontal
DIY,not_removed,i always use inch the hd by me has some decent pine ply for bucks a sheet kregg jigs are super great but you could get away with screws and predrillcountersink id make the sides full height then the shelves full width in between the sides then just add the shorter dividers sometimes i add a inch piece of ply to the back to prevent racking like the dude below says
DIY,not_removed,the backing is generally enough i like to use pocket screws for butt joints when working with ply i usually use for the outer case the inner parts could be those spans are short enough that i dont think youll have to worry about warpage i use a lockmiter bit for solid lumber when i want a nice clean or traditional joinery depending on the final design look for plywood you will probably want to do a rabbet or a miter rabbet depending on what tools you have available and how it supports the structure for example you want the rabbet cut on the vertical structure so the plywood doesnt delaminate you should be able to google both easily but heres a link
DIY,not_removed,you might get away with using a thicker laminate this whole piece is designed rather flimsy for side ways tensions so to fix the problem you will need to take a measure of dowel inserts to strengthen the structure try to use large dowel size for your chosen material for the side panels make them heavier on the thickness as too the top and base examples best seen in any flat pack furniture maker final note hiring a cabinet maker to do this might be a better idea maybe even cheaper if you make errors
DIY,not_removed,even at square with depth sheets were gonna be necessary i was debating but kept it to mainly to simplify measurements haha guess ill have to pony up also really didnt want to put backing on it but sounds like thats necessary for support
DIY,not_removed,if you look at the exploded view on the right side i was planning on having all horizontal shelves one length capping them together with an end piece then all vertical supportshelves would be inserts apologies i dont know the correct terminology for any of this haha
DIY,not_removed,for the racking the left side of the left unit will be against a wall and the right units left side will be pressed against the left unit if i add backing would that be enough this is pretty strictly to hold records and imagine this will be my main means of storage for them for quite some time so i dont think ill bother making anything adjustable
DIY,not_removed,other than upgrading to this is pretty much exactly what i had planned glad i wasnt entirely off haha thanks
DIY,not_removed,great link thanks rabbet top and bottom shelves dado the middle two dowelsbiscuits on all
DIY,not_removed,for sideways tension the left side of the left unit will be against a wall and the right units left side will be pressed against the left unit if i add backing id imagine that might be enough
DIY,not_removed,yeah i would put a back on it pretty necessary to hold everything together solidly with the weight here like i said though the back is just a perimeter and ledger mount so you can u could use the cheapest stuff out there like wafer board good luck post project p s also consider your finish would recommend just stain and varnish you do not want it to transfer to the lp covers and you dont want it to mar easily like a white paint would
DIY,not_removed,use inch if you dont want to measure alot lol
DIY,not_removed,yes either will work i would use the suggestion someone else mentioned use wood dowel connections between the shelf connections this will seriously rigid up the unit and could possibly eliminate the need for a backer should you desire this aesthetic
DIY,not_removed,you want the rabbet cuts on vertical structure if you cut the rabbets on the horizontal boards you are only supporting load from the top on half the thickness of the plywood and it can delaminate if you look at the guide i posted it should look like the image posted dont reverse it
DIY,not_removed,the backing will barely help the real sideways preventer is the use of dowels joining the shelfs correctly the wall will assist however you will find most walls are there not designed for it and may even fail
DIY,not_removed,definitely going the stainvarnish route thanks for the heads up
DIY,not_removed,right i phrased that poorly haha all the cuts would be on the two vertical boards but the top and bottom horizontal shelves would sit inside rabbet cuts on the vertical two middle shelves would sit inside dado cuts on the vertical correct
DIY,not_removed,also all these are very unforgiving tolerancewise breaking down sheets without a saw that has extended wings like a cabinet saw will be difficult if you are using anything short of real machinery you might be better off face framing your plywood
DIY,not_removed,yep
DIY,not_removed,another really surefire way to prevent racking of any kind would be to use your table saw to cut an slot around the inside back of your box like a kitchen drawer is made then you assemble sides and cut your hardboard to slide in then attach the bottom your depth would have to increase slightly to accommodate but it would be a ton stronger than just tacking would to the back
DIY,not_removed,holy shit thats beautiful very well done
DIY,not_removed,absolutely stunning that walnut grain is mind bending you could stare into it for hours its like a bonfire
DIY,not_removed,just saw httpimgurcompqnqkex in the thread right above this one and thought it was perfect here edit i seem to hit a nerve with a few people calm yourselves folks it was supposed to be funny i actually have a decent amount of vinyl and some decent equipment i run it through which is how i know how expensive it can be lighten up
DIY,not_removed,everything here is absolute masterclass but i must give special compliments to the super light legs that little detail enhances the woodwork and makes the piece come together perfectly
DIY,not_removed,i just got a record player for xmas i need this ill take one and give you like deal
DIY,not_removed,humble herman miller brag
DIY,not_removed,people like this exist in the wild my impression is that people this good with this much style usually have a tv show or something great job man
DIY,not_removed,industrial designer
DIY,not_removed,i really want to be your friend
DIY,not_removed,im blown away thats amazing really nice diy baby too i assume you made that as well
DIY,not_removed,the amp looks homemade are they tubes could you give some details on your setup
DIY,not_removed,gorgeous i love the continuous grain what mitre tool did you use for that in the few other projects ive seen here that make use of keys to hold a piece of wood together the design choice is to put them on the outside surface my instinct would be to hid them on the inside why do they go on the outside
DIY,not_removed,i wouldnt mind seeing your turntable design plans either
DIY,not_removed,this is the sexiest cabinet ive ever seen
DIY,not_removed,ive told you before but i really appreciate you showing your design process for this sub too many people just set out with an idea and go its important to explore things with thumbnail sketches at least youve obviously got rendered models but its the same thing beautiful execution as usual
DIY,not_removed,that is stunning and absolutely beautiful if i ever make a cabinet as nice i will consider it a crown jewel of my life i love audio equipment and midcentury modern design excellent work on everything please continue to post your projects
DIY,not_removed,immaculate build are you also a professional musician and woodworker
DIY,not_removed,dont normally post replies but i just had to say that you are immensely talented good sir keep up the great work
DIY,not_removed,this is every kind of awesome bravo our of curiosity i know absolutely nothing about wood working whats the point of the bowties structural integrity btw your description says chord management instead of cord
DIY,not_removed,both this and the jewelry cabinet are fine work i need to get back to work so i can keep building my tool collection i made gifts for xmas but its apparent i need to up my game well done
DIY,not_removed,i want this
DIY,not_removed,eh no big deal huge deal thats so nice i would like to have it please
DIY,not_removed,these looks amazing
DIY,not_removed,beautiful meticulous and inspiring work well done also cord not chord
DIY,not_removed,sweet setup amazing really
DIY,not_removed,wow the cabinet looks awesome im not a huge fan of the cabinet fronts that look like segmented pieces of wood but you should and probably do take pride in the craftsmanship you did an awesome job and i love the attention to detail in everything including the fan vent
DIY,not_removed,very very cool little bit of an audiophile arent you haha
DIY,not_removed,im more interested in the diy hifi equipment but the cabinet looks good too
DIY,not_removed,love that rubio monicoat that stuff is amazing
DIY,not_removed,what was the overall cost and what tools are required for such a project
DIY,not_removed,i am in absolute awe the pulls are so perfect the whole cabinet is amazing and i suspect that you could sell that for a pretty penny to high end audiophiles if i had the money id pay up to for that topic jump can you post a pic of what looks to be a live edge coffee table on photo
DIY,not_removed,oh my god this is fucking beautiful
DIY,not_removed,that is beautiful
DIY,not_removed,ive been getting into wood working the cabinet looks fabulous when you joined the ash early on to make the main cabinet did you dowelbiscuitmortoise or just glue them end to end how did you do the long mitres did you use a router on the inside mortises or do it by hand ive been looking at getting some chisels and a hand planer any recommendations
DIY,not_removed,i love that build out i remember your posts on your turntable all really inspiring work
DIY,not_removed,could all the audio nerds please quiet down and just congratulate this guy on a great homemade hifi cabinet bravo sir
DIY,not_removed,where are those awesome brass legs from
DIY,not_removed,wow fantastic work wood looks amazing
DIY,not_removed,absolutely beautiful very nice work op
DIY,not_removed,this is beautiful thank you for documenting your build so well and for sharing
DIY,not_removed,chord management i love you op
DIY,not_removed,damn dude this is next level almost makes me want to give up on the weakass project im planning
DIY,not_removed,your attention to detail and the confidence with which your aesthetic was realized is impressive also it looks like you could burn incense in the the center of the turntable
DIY,not_removed,goddamn thats beautiful i need that
DIY,not_removed,fantastic
DIY,not_removed,id love the plans for a basic version of this its just so damn cool
DIY,not_removed,at most high end audiophile shows the room in which the gear is being displayed is most often times playing music from vinyl these rooms can contain of thousands of dollars worth of equipment and they choose to play vinyl makes you think they do that for a reason
DIY,not_removed,love this the whole hifi industry and hobby is ridiculous imo digital has far less distortion a far greater dynamic range and is far less inexpensive the whole modern vinyl and now tape industry is built on pseudoscience and barnumesque deception and sales tactics in other words its a scam not only that but from the looks of the photos ops room isnt treated whatever pleasant distortion that homemade system adds to the mastering engineers craft is destroyed when sound bounces around that room willy nilly
DIY,not_removed,sold meet me at the the local kmart please pay me in runescape gold
DIY,not_removed,ah i miss harris wittels
DIY,not_removed,architect actually good guess though
DIY,not_removed,its a bottlehead kit im a noob at most electronics so it was a good way to jump into amplification
DIY,not_removed,second this question looks amazing
DIY,not_removed,neither just enjoy building stuff
DIY,not_removed,can you post a picture of you in your moms basement with your head shoulders deep in your bung
DIY,not_removed,playback from vinyl does nothing but add distortion to a recorded signal the warmth that highend audio sellers tout is actually a kind of distortion i could literally record the output of a record player at and play the recording backtoback with the original and it would be impossible for you to tell which was the vinyl its science the reason high end audiophile shows play vinyl is because their victims customers buy into the ludicrous idea that vinyl sound better
DIY,not_removed,music on vinyl records is neither better nor worse than digital music justdifferent really really high quality equipment tends to highlight and showcase those differences astonishingly well thats why most of the sound is coming from a record or a reeltoreel instead of a sacd or something like that
DIY,not_removed,the problem with treatment is that its usually pretty ugly i honestly care about how things look as much as how they sound and i generally just like building stuff anyway i cant comment on the empirical differences in sound in vinyl vs digital but there is to me a difference not in sound necessarily but in ritual and experience when im on spotify i jump from song to song willy nilly most often in the middle of songs full songs are rarities full albums non existent but spin a record and youre forced to actually listen to the entire album and this ritual one that takes time patience and slowing down is a very nice reprise from the chaos and schizophrenia of the digital world to each their own
DIY,not_removed,not saying things arent over hyped but a lot of what youre saying is just false not even remotely true
DIY,not_removed,its a hobby people can do with it whatever they want a turntable is a good conversation starter if youre having people over a lot less so than talking about your xmos stage
DIY,not_removed,the hifi industry and hobby includes digital anyway people on the vinyl side of the hobby enjoy the collecting the ritual of it the nostalgia and the different sounds yes you can call this distortion of all the components you can string together who am i kidding this is reddit where the iamverysmart folks like yourself love trying to make other people feel bad about normal things they enjoy what an enjoyable life you must live
DIY,not_removed,i bet youre a lot of fun at parties
DIY,not_removed,some people prefer the analog sound while digital has more dynamic range nobody seems to be taking advantage of it and normalizing the entire track to httpbrianstaggcoukptaclipressed is a link showing the same depeche mode track on cd and on vinyl the cd has no dynamic range at all
DIY,not_removed,beautiful work loved the ideation page
DIY,not_removed,bottlehead makes nice kits i used to subscribe to his zine back in the
DIY,not_removed,there actually is some science that vinyl preserves some very subtle reflection components if the original recording environment that digital recording does not as it is mastered out same thing as film vs digital cameras film is more forgiving at the extremes these low level reflections are thought to be partly responsible for what people refer to as air in a recording ive done side by sides on good equipment between uncompressed digital audio and vinyl and the vinyl for whatever reason sounded noticeably better
DIY,not_removed,but spin a record and youre forced to actually listen to the entire album and this ritual one that takes time patience and slowing down is a very nice reprise from the chaos and schizophrenia of the digital world to each their own very well said im a digital guy i work from home and i have a desktop ampdac setup with multiple pairs of fairly high end headphones and i listen to spotify for hours every day however i most definitely see the allure of vinyl and your explanation puts it perfectly into words its not always about the numbers sometimes its about the ritual and the experience
DIY,not_removed,i find a certain type of person can be immobilized by a lack of tangible logical rationale for concepts like this there is more to life than the stats on paper top gear does a nice job of explaining this in the automotive world you have hightech cars and lowtech cars new and old nice explanation
DIY,not_removed,fair enough regarding the ritual
DIY,not_removed,prove it
DIY,not_removed,couldnt agree more so what you want fortunately when i have people over my discussions are more substantive than needlesslyhigh sampling rates
DIY,not_removed,nah do what you want im satisfied enough in life knowing that i dont waste money on pseudoscience actually why should i bother this is reddit where overgrown man children will engage in olympiclevel mental gymnastics to justify their hobby as more than anything but an attempt to make their middleclass peers jealous of their very tiny dicks happy new year
DIY,not_removed,thats not true for all cds and is the fault of the mastering engineers rather than a strength of the medium you could master a cd the same way and it would actually sound better because a cd is capable or reproducing a greater dynamic range than vinyl
DIY,not_removed,modern vinyl is pressed from a digital master before that it was pressed from reel to reel tape a fully analog recording process hasnt been used since the victrola when youd cut a record yourself and yet i still collect it for no specific reason it makes me happy like lego or tiki cocktails
DIY,not_removed,link ill believe it when i read it also the human ear cant hear above so air actually refers to frequencies in the upper end of the human hearing spectrum as for low level digital recording media have a demonstrably better capability for reproducing dynamic range so if there were some low level mojo it would come out better on cd better is subjective
DIY,not_removed,wasnt there a period of time between digital recording and the victrola which one was led zeppelin or the beach boys recorded on im with you on tiki cocktails though im currently drinking a mai tai
DIY,not_removed,oh ive got a great recipe for the original trader vic mai tai if you want it thats one of my favorite cocktails as for the period of time between fullanalog and fulldigital wasnt magnetic wire in there somewhere
DIY,not_removed,it depends on what you define as digital if you define it as computer mastered thats fairly recent or however if you define it as the signal is changed into electrical signals not since wax cylinders if you go that route anything through a mixing board would be digital
DIY,not_removed,im drinking the smugglers cove mai tai its really close to the trader vics version but it only uses one rum instead of two aged jamaican and it adds a little vanilla to the sugar syrup its a little sweeter than vics was if you havent picked up the smugglers cove book i highly recommend it wire recording was before tape and around the same time as edison cylinders i think generally most things before about were recorded analog i was an assistant recording engineer from about and we were completely analog with the the exception of hip hop and dance music who usually requested digital recording
DIY,not_removed,im really confused by what you mean by anything through a mixing board is digital i define digital as recorded to a digital medium like a hard drive or a digital recorder like an adat if it goes to analog tape like most things before the then its analog electrical is still analog if its recorded to magnetic tape electrical is still a wave and not ones and zeroes
DIY,not_removed,i think ill look into that thanks for the tip

DIY,not_removed,is that on old dryer vent or something weird you could use expanding closed cell foam and then trim off the excess patch the siding on the outside and patch the plaster on the inside
DIY,not_removed,is it brick
DIY,not_removed,thats odd my question would actually be why is it there in the first place is this there to let the house breathe after a botched insulation job that caused damp from condensation or something like that
DIY,not_removed,fill pvc with insulation cap pvc wrap pvc in insulation stuff in hole patch both sides of wall
DIY,not_removed,sorry more info red brick wall there used to a back boiler in the chimney breast which apparently necessitated this vent thanks
DIY,not_removed,sorry more info red brick wall there used to a back boiler in the chimney breast which apparently necessitated this vent
DIY,not_removed,this is probably your best bet
DIY,not_removed,thanks total noob question what do you mean by pvc
DIY,not_removed,plastic pipe pipes are what take the shit right outta your house sorry noob im a smartass
DIY,not_removed,white pipe
DIY,not_removed,pvc polyvinyl chloride a very common plastic

DIY,not_removed,just a guess hole saw for corners then tile saw to connect them
DIY,not_removed,when my granite guys came out they use an angle grinder with a inch blade like this they cut inch holes at each corner and connected them with the blade they dribbled water from the garden hose to keep the dust down then they smoothed out the cuts with a carbide disc on an angle grinder also using water fun fact saved the cutout and created a shelf for the patio inside of washroom outside morale of the story dont throw out your cutout it has value

DIY,not_removed,to keep water or other liquids from leaking into the void between the cabinet and walls would be a bitch to get out
DIY,not_removed,how come it wasnt just caulked
DIY,not_removed,here was the scene it was late friday afternoon i had been working in that little unair conditioned room for hours it was degrees in the shade i got the base and counter top in and realized that the gap was just too large do i make the trip to home depot for backer rod and caulking or do i use what i have on hand so that i can drive home and pop open a cold one that day i settled for good enough i admit it my bad i know sometimes you do things like that

DIY,not_removed,anytime ive had blinds made the salesman has come to the house and measured it themselves
DIY,not_removed,this website walks you through measuring it yourself httpwwwstevesblindsandwallpapercomblhowtomeasureaspxdisplaymodeblinds
DIY,not_removed,they arent in separated boxes unfortunately i guess that would be the best way to describe it haha
DIY,not_removed,if i am understanding this right pics would help i would run the center window blind close to the window and as wide as possible then i would run the two side ones until they almost bump into it set an inch or so back into the room so they overlap the middle one this will eliminate any see through gaps when closed hope this helps
DIY,not_removed,ive down the standard windows in my house myself just not sure how to do a bay window

DIY,not_removed,the back pegboard would need to be secured to the wall or have some diagonal braces to the counter top those vertical pipes will not be super sturdy and when u add tools to the pegboard u might end up in wobble town
DIY,not_removed,considering your just using it for soldering and model making it shouldnt be under any intense loads it should be fine if it where me id make the height a bit smaller just to be safe but you can also improve its ability to take loads and add storage if you add some simple wood boxesdraws for storage below the desk remember to keep ergonomics in mind dont worry about structure it makes sense find your own ergonomic values and apply that to your design also one plank of wood should be fine anything around a thickness of is great use metric you butt hope i was of help 😊
DIY,not_removed,im in the middle of building a pipe desk my desk will be x my local home depot has a much better selection of pipe than lowes there are two types of pipe and the black piping is susceptible to corrosion so it is coated in wax the galvanized is coated in oil i ended up buying galvanized pipe with black flanges and tees i washed everything with hot water soap and cleaner then i used grit sandpaper on the pipes finally i washed the pipes with vinegar the acidic vinegar is supposed to etch the pipes which will allow the spray paint to adhere to them better between the black and galvanized i dont know which one is better the galvanized is easy to clean and doesnt rust but painting it is a pain google painting galvanized and you will see what i mean most spray paint says to not use on galvanized you can use as a primer or you can use i hope the acid wash does the trick because i only spray painted mine with flat black paint for my desk surface i found httpiimgurcomvprwjjojpg at lowes for dirt cheap these are thick they had some that are thick but i would have to join multiple panels together they have something similar at home depot but the ones at lowes seemed to be higher quality i am going to use for my design i have six legs two on either side and two along the back all of my legs are made up of from bottom to top a flange pipe tee pipe and a flange the total length is around the legs on the sides are joined together with an pipe the two legs on the back are joined with a pipe i dont think youll have anything to worry about with your design
DIY,not_removed,unfortunately securing to the wall is not an option here also which vertical pipes the ones for the shelf or the ones for the legs
DIY,not_removed,im an american metric is a sin
DIY,not_removed,good idea on the pine panel ive worked with that in a woodshop class pretty sturdy stuff
DIY,not_removed,the shelf ones the legs are sturdy due to the horizontals and the weight ofsecuring to the counter maybe just add another return like the one which holds the top shelf but upside down and connected to the counter
DIY,not_removed,wow thats a beautiful design for the drawer faces good work i cant figure out how you open them though i dont see any finger tabs are the grooves from the pattern deep enough to just pinch a couple surfaces and pull the drawer open or do you use some other method
DIY,not_removed,just curious how you got your hands on a cnc work school do you own one
DIY,not_removed,amazing til what a shopbot is and now i must own one
DIY,not_removed,beautiful piece well done
DIY,not_removed,wow really impressive wish i had skills like this
DIY,not_removed,nicely done congratulations
DIY,not_removed,
DIY,not_removed,hey i have that lamp
DIY,not_removed,mahogany
DIY,not_removed,i tell you in my native language how to make the wood look almost as beautiful as in this picture je hebt een vijlboor nodig die zet je er kaps op dan iedere vijf seconden een kwartslag draaien daarna gaan we het even frezen heel kort met de frees tegen de randjes van het hout aan zorg dat het hout niet verbrandt want dan vernaggel je het hele bijzettafeltje hierna moeten we het hout zoals dat heet stukken heel voorzichtig met het stukmiddel over de gehele oppervlakte van het hout gaan laat dit een nachtje hard worden en gooi dan de hele tyfuszooi ergens in een put en bestel een mooie tafel bij jysk of praxis
DIY,not_removed,great work but the more i browse rdiy the more i realize it is more like rdiditatmakerspacemyself and i am jealous that i dont have that cnc stuff in my workshop my wife says no i cant have one either
DIY,not_removed,i believe op said they were bump to open so you would push it in and it would click open enough to pull it
DIY,not_removed,ha you and me both ive already been trying to think about how i could fit one in my garage however shared access will have to do given the price
DIY,not_removed,lol this is amazing
DIY,not_removed,exactly you just give them a small bump and they spring open about
DIY,not_removed,makerspace so lucky to have this local i could never justify owning this gear wwwtinkermillorg
DIY,not_removed,yeah right im actually surprised by the cost im sure its a great piece of equipment but wooh pricey how did u get into woodworking and specifically the shopbot
DIY,not_removed,wow that place is well equipped too bad i live on the wrong side of denver im in the parker area

DIY,not_removed,i did this not too long ago you dont need an underlayment at all i put down glue my lvps were selfadhesive but i wanted more structure let it get tacky and put the planks on top like you said the baseboards were too high so we ripped them off and bought new ones you will also find that your doors will be too high i had to replace mine completely because there was a gap

DIY,not_removed,ill make sure to keep that in mind thank you
DIY,not_removed,how does one polish and figure the mirror into the precise shape needed
DIY,not_removed,whats a project like this cost i have the tools to build everything but the glass
DIY,not_removed,whoa
DIY,not_removed,very cool
DIY,not_removed,fantastic project wow
DIY,not_removed,awesome
DIY,not_removed,galileo would be proud and jealous i would think
DIY,not_removed,awesome thank you for sharing please post other images of what you see
DIY,not_removed,nice job ive never seen someone cut their own blank only order or furnace form love those snaps if youre bored check out i printed based on dob the scope obviously is not diy but an orion st refractor all but the ota is diy including the rings and plate
DIY,not_removed,nice i have always wanted to try this x to make binocular telescope
DIY,not_removed,dude sick
DIY,not_removed,looks great i cringe a little looking at the particle board its so susceptible to expansion when it gets exposed to moisture i thought maybe it would survive as the mirror mount since its inside the tube and thus effectively shielded from dew but then i see particle board as the very base maybe put on a few more coats of polyurethane just to be safe
DIY,not_removed,awesome
DIY,not_removed,great job on the build i would be very interested to see any knife edgefoucaltgram pictures you might have im trying to think of what would be the easiest null interferometry test you could perform you probably dont have access to a large enough optical flat for a doublepass autocollimation test and the oil pan method is out too because of the design of the mirror cell cant suspend the mirror vertically face down
DIY,not_removed,lol diy i can barely hold a mirror while shaving holy crap dude this is amazing well done
DIY,not_removed,httpsstellafaneorgtmindexhtml is the website he said he used to help build the telescope it has pretty much all the info youll need the only thing you probably wont find is the price hopefully unotchrisk can give up a rough estimate on what it ran him for the materials
DIY,not_removed,when you rub the two glass halves together the random motion naturally turn into a parabolic shape i considered joining my friend when made his own dobsonian but the grinding takes days if not weeks of manual labor get a single scratch on it have to start over at a lower grit and start over again
DIY,not_removed,check out telescope building with john dobson on youtube hes famous for popularizing diy scopes and showsexplains all the basics in this minute video
DIY,not_removed,would like to know too
DIY,not_removed,a few hundred dollars the main cost is the pyrex the grit and time so much time oh youll also need to borrow someones vacuum chamber to atomize aluminum to the surface oh and youll want a nice eyepiece too
DIY,not_removed,see my reply to above similar question
DIY,not_removed,check ebay and the couple of internet companies that supply glass blanks grits complete mirror kits etc
DIY,not_removed,i have access to a waterjet at the makerspace just a few minutes from my house ive wanted to grind my own lense for years and cutting blanks on the jet was the first thing that came to mind
DIY,not_removed,thanks for the granite shop tip i did check with a local glass company initially and they were happy to quote me something like to send my sheet of glass across the state to their subcontractor to water jet a few disks for me i declined the offer i will have to check a local granite fabricator though should be routine work for them
DIY,not_removed,nice i think i want a printer and a water jet for christmas
DIY,not_removed,i spent roughly on the project including cost of a few decent eyepieces the most expensive portion of it all for me i got a glass table top from a thrift shop for all the gritspolishpitch cost about wood that i didnt already have on hand was about for paint to get mirror coated and a few other smaller expenses along the way im pretty good at cheaping my way through this sort of project so a similar size scope might cost you more than depending on what materials you can scrounge up check ebay for mirror kits blanks other components smaller scopes i think can be done for much cheaper
DIY,not_removed,basically yes a spherical curve forms naturally during grinding and initial polishing it is a little more complicated when you get to the point of polishing in the parabolic shape but there is plenty of info out there on how to do this and if you can find a local astronomy club you may be able to get the assistance of someone or join in on a mirror making class the amount of grinding and polishing increases rapidly as you go up in mirror size but a fine mirror can be made by just about anyone with the interest and some diligence from things ive read plenty of year old kids have made scopes with a little guidance from an experienced person
DIY,not_removed,there are a handful of companies around the country that do the mirror coating fairly wide spread of costs for the service though so check around but go with a company with a good rep
DIY,not_removed,i wonder if you could also do the as well provided you had the correct materials
DIY,not_removed,i feel like with cindercement it would be harder for rain and such to make the shed uneven in the ground just a sturdier foundation that resists nature better imo window could be nice to crack open so air doesnt get stale inside in summer i hate opening my shed and getting blasted with degree air but its more personal basic but important make sure the roof is water tight because you want to avoid rain trickling in somehow
DIY,not_removed,sheds are pretty simple im sure the plan is fine if it were me i would want longer eaves and more overhang for the roof to keep water off more of the shed and runoff further away from the foundation light and air if you open it besides that it provides headaches and costs you probably want a window in there to keep if from getting dank the disadvantage to using wood skids rather than cement block is that all wood eventually rots the advantage of skids is its easier do it really depends on what you are using the shed for will you be in it or will you only store dirty yard equipment inside if youre just storing junk and want a cheap shed then that one is fine as is if you want something better id look for a better plan or spend some time designing something yourself sheds really are very basic and can be easily designed even by someone with no experience at all other than the rafters its all just square cuts and the rafters will be easy once you find the angles you need and make one template the rest will just be cutting
DIY,not_removed,nothing wrong with the plan i built one a few years back a shed roof is easier to build and just sheds water off one side in your plans it sheds water over the door also a window is really nice with a shed roof you can put it in the high wall part keeping it out of your way makes the shed much more useful i would use wood top pier blocks on each rim joist perpendicular to your joist the beams are not necessarily
DIY,not_removed,looks fine to me except the wall structures part shows walls for an shed gutters downspouts and metal drip edge on all roof edges extra light and ventilation are pretty rad in a shed i would mount post bases in from each end of the skids total and set them all in concrete at least deep you can use osb for the roof and floor sheeting to save some money get premade vented bird blocks for between the rafters and if you come up with a complete materials package most good lumber yardsnot home depot will give you a discount and deliver for free and to be honest they can help a lot with fine tuning your package in general ask about trusses theyre generally pretty cheap and way easier than building your own
DIY,not_removed,i built a shed with sides on skids using fence posts and palings and i can guarantee it is not less expensive than buying a kit at least where i am anyway i used a modified version of this
DIY,not_removed,head to the library and check out back issues of family handyman theyre free and every year they have some form of shed in there usually around apriljune because that seems to be the time most people get interested in outdoor usage one thing to start with is a good foundation im a fan of a floating foundation because its faster and simpler to create you only have to level and tamp four or six or however many holes instead of the entire square footage what do you plan on putting into the shed that will also dictate the plan you build and the features you put in

DIY,not_removed,other tips use clearlite for roofing as then you dont need a window downsides are it can heat up more cause sun damage to fabric plastics and rubbreer angle your roof at least degrees and install a simple gutter you can have a down pipe to a rain barrel if you want treated timber with ground contact will be fine in pnw cedar would prob be ok too scrounge what you can i got clearlite a sliding door guttering and a rain barrel off my neighbour for free
DIY,not_removed,picture if space for reference
DIY,not_removed,some interesting ideas there thank you
DIY,not_removed,construction adhesive is strong stuff but those blocks really should be in mortar i would only put the stairs you are talking about on a properly prepared poured footing but why not wooden stairs
DIY,not_removed,you would need a bobcat with an anger attachment to dig the footings so you are correct it wont be easy but i dont see away around not having footings and having stable stairs not in main good luck
DIY,not_removed,please post some pictures
DIY,not_removed,i am trying to avoid pouring footings my read on wood stairs which may be incorrect is that i will need to pour footings to a depth of in ma my yard is very rocky so i dont know if its even possible to dig down that deep in that area
DIY,not_removed,nice job just a tip with most forms of wood especially ply you avoid the laser stains you mentioned by applying a thin masking tape to the cut surface masking tape is actually a bit thick but you can get it in wide rolls just be sure to adjust your vector cut power settings a little in case it adds some resistance to the cut but for smaller thing like this blue painters tape works really well and doesnt leave and adhesive on the surface a lot of people use wet tissue paper over the cut surface although ive found it to be a mess and just stick with tape nice job of the box again
DIY,not_removed,so my wedding is in june if you want to make me one absolutely gorgeous
DIY,not_removed,very nice op they will cherish it for years to come while practical gifts are helpful its things people made us with wedding date or initials on them that mean more and that we keep out around the house its been years and the quilt the best mans mom made for us still stays out
DIY,not_removed,those lasers can make some amazing things i did not realize i could covet a box
DIY,not_removed,beautiful for your sharing of the files you might look at ponoko you could put them there for people to order the pieces though clearly theyd want to alter it for the name layer
DIY,not_removed,bet that wasnt on their list at
DIY,not_removed,i love it curious how strong it is

DIY,not_removed,beautiful you created a family heirloom to be treasured for generations that is a special talent
DIY,not_removed,now thats how you laser cut something ive seen so many laser cut projects that just leave it as it is right out of the laser cutter but with care and finishing like youve done here it really elevates it to something extraordinary
DIY,not_removed,bugger bit new to this but think somebody asked what xyz tables are basically you can program to move around in space x y and z coordinates with anything you want bolted on the end like a laser cutter scanner router print head or anything lots of great free software to convert movements from drawings etc right up to mega expensive cadcam software this is one of my small ones httpsyoutubefnarrwjvqqo think i need a bigger laser and have some box fun
DIY,not_removed,schoon gedaan man
DIY,not_removed,its amazing and beautiful but i have to ask why mdf instead of hardwood was it the difficulty of getting hardwood in a precise thickness or is there some technical reason why cherry or maple doesnt work well in a laser cutter
DIY,not_removed,because i need another reason to want a laser
DIY,not_removed,i used to run an industrial grade laser and i think op needs my help httpiimgurcomnraeqaqpng
DIY,not_removed,looks like the lemarchands box from hellraiser good luck kim and matthias

DIY,not_removed,how to make good wood to look like wicker
DIY,not_removed,nice
DIY,not_removed,with mdf are you worried about the integrity of the box if it gets wet it looks great i would just be worried about longevity
DIY,not_removed,very well done op what kind of machine do you haveuse
DIY,not_removed,looks great i dont really like mdf as a material would this work well with real wood how do you avoid any scorch marks
DIY,not_removed,beautiful
DIY,not_removed,thats seriously impressive
DIY,not_removed,after years the only wedding gifts i can recall that we still have are hand made im looking at one right now ceramic urn weve filled with match books from our travels hand made is so personal and means a lot to the receiver good job
DIY,not_removed,i get decent results with one of those cheap chinese units you can find on ebay i used to work with a couple of epilogs and got hooked but seeing as i live in a small apartment the better cutters werent really an option also im broke im actually just finishing up a laser cut jewelry box as a late christmas gift for my mom it was supposed to be done for xmas but i kept making it more elaborate in its current state it has pieces
DIY,not_removed,what kind of investment is involved in a laser cutter my dad is artistic but has become disabled by age and is desperate for something to do thanks
DIY,not_removed,great job on this op i have an epilog helix and love seeing people do stuff like this i made a series of boxes for my shop using hardiboard to help organize things behind my counters as well as some acrylic display stands a number of people have asked you to share your files for this rather than pming everyone individually think about setting up a free account with thingiverse and posting it there
DIY,not_removed,wow beautiful beautiful work this makes me want to look into building a laser
DIY,not_removed,where are people finding these laser cutters
DIY,not_removed,supers

DIY,not_removed,resistance is futile you will be matrimonied
DIY,not_removed,you know all that shit you have no idea where to puti got you a place to put it
DIY,not_removed,zero pics of the laser cutting process and you still have votes no way jose
DIY,not_removed,did you fill it full of bees thatll teach them for the cash bar great work there has to be a business in making these for high price weddings
DIY,not_removed,anyone who likes this should check out httpcedarstreetdesigncom which is what this is based on
DIY,not_removed,love the design just curious was there a reason you didnt do an alternating pattern for the puzzle piece at the corners of the box in image so if each of the spots on the corner edges were numbered down from top to bottom the left side has even holes and the right side has odd holes that way you wouldnt have to figure out which piece goes to which piece i too would love to get my hands on your design is it alright if i pm you for it
DIY,not_removed,what kind of hardware is necessary are there inexpensive laser cutter options to achieve this
DIY,not_removed,straightup witchcraft
DIY,not_removed,do you have the blueprints for this id love to cut one
DIY,not_removed,just for my education what kind of power does the laser used put out
DIY,not_removed,what cutter do you use
DIY,not_removed,great job thats one of the nicest laser projects ive seen

DIY,not_removed,could i get a copy of the design files you wonderful person d
DIY,not_removed,thats cool
DIY,not_removed,kerel wanneer ga je trouwen
DIY,not_removed,i pmed you
DIY,not_removed,just curious what glue did you use
DIY,not_removed,are you going to post the design files
DIY,not_removed,how do you pronounce matthias
DIY,not_removed,how does it not catch fire during the cutting process
DIY,not_removed,we have such sights to show you
DIY,not_removed,i bet woodworkers are pissed now that lay people can blow them out of the water on price and time
DIY,not_removed,wtf wheres the banana so i know how big this is
DIY,not_removed,where the fuck is the laser i work in a laser cutting welding and engraving company and honestly never get tired of watching them work
DIY,not_removed,oh i can
DIY,not_removed,pro tip dont store your cannabis in that box
DIY,not_removed,can design this art and operate the device but then uses the word lasercutted
DIY,not_removed,you should totally make the box from hellraiser
DIY,not_removed,receives present looks inside oh its just a box begins only then to actually look at the box and appreciate it been there been there and wont ever go back
DIY,not_removed,so you store paperclips in it
DIY,not_removed,upvote for lasercutted
DIY,not_removed,true art is fading all you need is a computer and a laser cutter to call yourself an artist a true artist would have laid out the design cut that out by hand plan and set up the saw to make the precise cuts for the joints but nope just plug in the dimensions in the pc and press enter instant art karma
DIY,not_removed,missed opportunity for matt kim merch
DIY,not_removed,so you were appeasing the cenobites from hellraiser with a wedding gift kidding obviously really cool gift
DIY,not_removed,looks like a high quality finger box
DIY,not_removed,so what exactly is it
DIY,not_removed,but whats in the boooxxxxxxx
DIY,not_removed,please place banana in box
DIY,not_removed,the worst part about breaking up might be this amazing lasercut wooden box with both their names on it
DIY,not_removed,came here to say this the smokyness is nice sometimes but in general i like the look of the dark edge against a clean smoke free face
DIY,not_removed,when i cut engrave wood for clients i recommend either a damp papertowel or using a toothbrush with a small amount of water dish soap to scrub the smoke off honestly though most times the paper towel is more than enough masking tape does work well but most of my jobs arent small enough to justify covering the entire work surface with it
DIY,not_removed,i just use white vinegar and it removes the sticky residue
DIY,not_removed,thanks man and yeah taping it would be better to avoid the laser stains but i thought with staining this with a few layers it would be ok sometimes i do like those laser stains but for these boxes they are indeed not that nice if they are too visible
DIY,not_removed,i could give you the designs with both your names on just send me a pm
DIY,not_removed,say its just a normal gift or the price will be racked up
DIY,not_removed,thanks thats awesome sure hope they can cherish this was sure meant that way the box was of course filled with some very useful moneys
DIY,not_removed,my mothers a quilter if you every decide to store said quilt fold it up and put it in a cotton pillowcase never store it in a cardboard box unless it specifically states its acidfree cardboard but better safe than sorry mostcardboard contains acids that will discolor the fabric
DIY,not_removed,how is a quilt not practical
DIY,not_removed,boxes are the best
DIY,not_removed,cool thanks
DIY,not_removed,with the thickness tolerance on ponokos material eg for mdf one cant be ensured that mating pieces will fit together nicely
DIY,not_removed,ianalc i am not a laser cutter but i suspect it is because mdf is free of grain which allows you to make clean intricate cuts
DIY,not_removed,yes seems a little odd to me other responder is correct that it doesnt matter to a laser itll cut through any wood with incredible levels of accuracy i often use mdf core with a veneer of
DIY,not_removed,the biggest reason was time constraints it did not have the time to check out for nice woods and yes that would have been way better also for this to be layers the dimensions ans spacing between them needs to be correct so i used mdf because i knew i still had good pieces like that and it made me able to focus on drawing this and making it in one go
DIY,not_removed,thanks it is pretty sturdy all in all it is a layer of mdf and the box is only about so it holds up perfectly i wouldnt recommend throwing it thought but i have made similar sized boxes with only one layer and they are already pretty sturdy
DIY,not_removed,yeah me too have been waiting for glowforge for soooo long now for now it is fablab makerspaces and hackerspaces maybe they have some in your surrounding
DIY,not_removed,i got my laser cutter for from ebay and put about another in upgrades into it laser cutting really isnt that expensive of a hobby heres my cost breakdown
DIY,not_removed,yeah i sure can ill have to be home for that
DIY,not_removed,so i finished preparing the design with a proper description and all you can download it on my site httpsstevenrkmgithubio
DIY,not_removed,well the process is pretty simple im not sure what is expected from an instructable im also afraid that i dont have more pictures from the process next time
DIY,not_removed,do i get the entire spiral or just a piece
DIY,not_removed,thanks very much
DIY,not_removed,xara or inkscape or illustrator as long as it is vector i have been very content with xara for several years check out full spectrum laser muse if you want a good hobby laser one still though
DIY,not_removed,thanks that is so sweet misskisa
DIY,not_removed,thanks
DIY,not_removed,those are indeed cool the problem with lasers is that the tube is just too big to fit on one of those machines so they have to use lenses and mirrors to bounce the beam correctly
DIY,not_removed,bedankt jonge
DIY,not_removed,any wood would work in that kind of laser i just did not have the time to check for nice woods so i focused the design on mdf since i knew i had pieces left not sure how hard it would be to find nice woods in that thickness
DIY,not_removed,i used to run a schoolgrade glue pot its got wood under it he could have glued the holes back in
DIY,not_removed,belg nog beter
DIY,not_removed,sure would love to help out if i can pm me
DIY,not_removed,mr fancypants that has no laser
DIY,not_removed,thanks it was a trotec speedy or laser not sure anymore but they cost about i went to a local makerspace where you can use equipment like this
DIY,not_removed,what are xyz tables
DIY,not_removed,anything is possible with the mighty laser
DIY,not_removed,put things in it like you do with other boxes
DIY,not_removed,that is correct you can check out the design at httpsstevenrkmgithubio
DIY,not_removed,hydrogen peroxide helps out quite a bit
DIY,not_removed,you could use painters tape for that i didnt protect it i sanded the inner layer a bit until most of the laser stain was gone
DIY,not_removed,check them out at httpsstevenrkmgithubio pm if you want help
DIY,not_removed,drawing was about hours lasercutting was putting it all together and staining was an hour or two with pauses to let it dry
DIY,not_removed,you can check out and customize the plans here httpsstevenrkmgithubio pm me if you need help
DIY,not_removed,good wood its made from mdf not wood
DIY,not_removed,yeah some protective coat would have been better i hope the layers of stain help it protect a bit
DIY,not_removed,i wish i had the machine i used it was a trotec speedy or shared usage in a makerspace
DIY,not_removed,would work perfectly with any kind of real wood really or other materials like acrylic i didnt avoid the scorch marks but you can with painters tape what i did do was sanding softly so you can get rid of most of the scorch and the layers of stain probably also helped to hide it
DIY,not_removed,thanks
DIY,not_removed,thanks
DIY,not_removed,thanks i do hope they will enjoy this box for a long time
DIY,not_removed,i seriously need to check out those chinese lasers been waiting for my glowforge but im thinking of cancelling and damn pieces is huge would love to see that
DIY,not_removed,well i used a professional laser cutter in a shared maker space that one costs i wish i had one myself but thats not going to happen you can buy and upgrade cheap chinese lasers search for chinese laser i do not have any experience with those though of a class better you have fsl muse its about
DIY,not_removed,thanks man havent thought about thingiverse thats a good idea i did make a small site to host the designs at httpsstevenrkmgithubio would love to see thos organizing boxes you made have any pictures of it
DIY,not_removed,check for fablab hackerspaces or makerspaces in your area
DIY,not_removed,i used a shared trotec speed or just draw and experiment with it
DIY,not_removed,thanks i sure hope so
DIY,not_removed,haha yeah they do look kinda funky stacked together they really helped together with some elastic bands
DIY,not_removed,what is mdf
DIY,not_removed,it does give off a smell give it time
DIY,not_removed,yes belg om exact te zijn
DIY,not_removed,thanks for the compliments you can download my designs at httpsstevenrkmgithubio they are easily to edit and make your own i based my design on one of cedarstreetdesign check their etsy if you want to buy one
DIY,not_removed,thanks and cool that is an awesome box i really love that purple inner layer coming through those curves nice work
DIY,not_removed,i used a shared laser cutter that i can use pretty freely check for local fablabs hackerspaces or makerspaces they can help you out to find one of these machines you can also buy one they are quite expensive the one i used is you can buy a descent desktop laser muse fsl for around or cheap chinese ones for
DIY,not_removed,nou nou
DIY,not_removed,haha belg wel thanks
DIY,not_removed,belg hier
DIY,not_removed,lol no they are really laser cut jigs i used them together with rubber bands
DIY,not_removed,i didnt really clean them no i stained the full box with a couple of layers and so far there are no black marks leaving behind but yeah it is a bit of a problem for fresh boxes and thanks
DIY,not_removed,well of course i did think of it but i decided not to do it and i think it looks nice in the end result
DIY,not_removed,sorry here is a clip of the lasering process though
DIY,not_removed,thanks
DIY,not_removed,that would indeed be possible i use an online service for creating those box joints httpwwwmakercasecom you can find the designs on my site httpsstevenrkmgithubio
DIY,not_removed,a lasercutter is necessary there are some cheaper chinese ones for dollars the one i just is a professional one and costs
DIY,not_removed,check them out at httpsstevenrkmgithubio
DIY,not_removed,not sure but i used a trotec speedy or
DIY,not_removed,trotec speedy or shared in a makerspace
DIY,not_removed,thanks
DIY,not_removed,i used a shared trotec speed or
DIY,not_removed,haha here you go httpsstevenrkmgithubio
DIY,not_removed,haha ik ga niet trouwen
DIY,not_removed,a fast wood glue any wood glue will do fine
DIY,not_removed,here you go httpsstevenrkmgithubio
DIY,not_removed,somehow the french pronounciation of matias is the clostest you get to the dutch matthias just klick the speaker icon on the left
DIY,not_removed,my coworkers grandson is named matthias she pronounced it muhtieess
DIY,not_removed,if it has way more detail located in one place it sure can catch fire
DIY,not_removed,in addition to what op said some lasers like the one i have at work have an air assist that blasts compressed air right through the cutting head which helps stop flames from even forming in the first place
DIY,not_removed,not really this is an artsy box with no real purpose other than looking pretty you cant laser cut a well built dining room table or rocking chair
DIY,not_removed,its sorry i ate the banana
DIY,not_removed,i did not take any pictures of that part of the process i do however have a clip of it
DIY,not_removed,all those new words are copyrighted
DIY,not_removed,there was tons of money in that box
DIY,not_removed,downvoted for upvoting everything seems good here
DIY,not_removed,its not to my taste either
DIY,not_removed,rlewronggeneration
DIY,not_removed,true art done in this manner would be rare can you imagine cutting each of those rectangles by hand im guessing using a powered scrollsaw wouldnt be true art either i have a computer and access to a laser cutter the art in this case comes from designing the piece and then getting it into a format that can be cut after seeing how simple it is to cut things on a laser i decided to go for it myself now im in the process of learning about laser cutting capabilities different materials svg files inkscape and design not to mention other tools in the end few will know or care how much work i put into anything i create they will hopefully see the beauty in the creation though this comes from a traditional amatuer woodworker that harbored a serious hatred for cnc routing until i realized that it was just another art form imho that expands opportunities for new creations the painter may hate cameras but each have a place in creating art
DIY,not_removed,its just a different set of tools that you still need to understand how to use there are people that struggle with using word or excel let alone cad software and even then it still takes thought and spacial understanding to come up with the design as a whole
DIY,not_removed,youre describing craft not art and even at that youre still talking shite tools evolve
DIY,not_removed,most of them you dont spend much time in rdiy do you
DIY,not_removed,im no expert but it looks like a box
DIY,not_removed,there was a nice silk little bag in there with money for the married couple
DIY,not_removed,just run the laser through the center fixed
DIY,not_removed,yeah theres certainly times when the smoke shadow looks good and i leave it alone but i find on really intricate things like this box you want the detail of the cuts to be really sharp and contrasted you can always sand it but i find again you lose some of that sharpness on the edges im also experimenting with a fan underneath the laser bed to see if that would negate the need for tapetissues
DIY,not_removed,ive never understood the damp paper towel thing it just made a mess on m wood when i did it and i couldnt get accurately repeatable results but most for my jobs are small run mass productions
DIY,not_removed,does that work on plywood with ply its usually the glue or better said the formaldehyde in the glue layers that causes the stain and not much else apart from sanding will get it out
DIY,not_removed,im invited to a wedding in a few months if i could get a copy of this you would spare me quite a bit of worry and time
DIY,not_removed,what format are the design files
DIY,not_removed,engineering at its finest imo lol
DIY,not_removed,if you could share it with me too id really appreciate it im doing a small jewellery collection for my mom and something like this would definitely be helpful
DIY,not_removed,would you be willing to share the design files so i could make one of these
DIY,not_removed,howdy is there any way you can please send me the cad files for this my sisters wedding is coming up and i would love to make her and her to be husband one
DIY,not_removed,just curious if this idea came from meow wolf in nm they have boxes lile these very cool
DIY,not_removed,thanks so much for the info
DIY,not_removed,to clarify i meant i was more careful and gentle about the way we treated it we werent handing it to our first or second born when they were in the spit up phase or had the stomach flu
DIY,not_removed,it is thank you for pointing that out my mistake
DIY,not_removed,is that what it is i was just wondering what the function was
DIY,not_removed,that actually has very little to do with it one of the great things about lasers is they dont care about grain but they do care about density so while grain and density of wood are usually related theyre not the same thing mdf just cuts cleanly because its fucking sawdust and glue
DIY,not_removed,i wish we had access to these kinds of places in my country they sound awesome
DIY,not_removed,the early reviews ive seen about it left a lot to be desired honestly with it having a requirement to be connected to the internet for functionality id be worried about obsolescence
DIY,not_removed,how much would this cost to build in terms of consumables
DIY,not_removed,thanks man that is awesome
DIY,not_removed,dibs d
DIY,not_removed,id be really interested to see the javascript file that generates the svg havent thought of using that
DIY,not_removed,remindme day
DIY,not_removed,im not sure how stoked i am that you reverse engineeredcopied the idea from an artist on etsy and are now releasing the filesoffering to make these for people its a cool box and the original work you did is cool but im not sure how i truly feel
DIY,not_removed,i volunteer as tribute so you have someone for whom youd make the next one and take plenty of pics lol great job this will hopefully be cherished for many years
DIY,not_removed,whatever makes it out of the fryer
DIY,not_removed,yeah inkscape is my software of choice when it comes to vector drawings but i didnt knew about xara though that muse laser looks cool but for now i will keep looking for new labspaces in my proximity d
DIY,not_removed,thanks
DIY,not_removed,yeah i all considered it but i do like the end result like this
DIY,not_removed,incredible i live in leuven and have knowledge of woodworking if you send info to others can you send me a copy if i feel im up to this i might try to make one for coming june
DIY,not_removed,what is a makerspace that sounds amazing and ive never heard of it i would love a place where i could go use tools far out if my price range edit thanks to all of you for your advice it looks like the closest place to me that offers stuff like this is a little over six hours away but im amazedhappy that places like this exist hopefully one will happen near me soon id be there all the time
DIY,not_removed,how long does something like this take to cut im currently into printing and own a few but i have been looking at laser cutters as well while technically feasible although not out of wood this would be extremely time restrictive probably take easily hours on a printer
DIY,not_removed,could you elaborate treat the edges afterwards or soak it before
DIY,not_removed,a few things didnt fit quite as well as i would have liked i think my artwork was a little off only look into the chinese if youre willing to put a bunch of time into tweaking and adjusting things mine cuts okay but etches terribly ive seen people get great results but im sure they have much more patience than me
DIY,not_removed,thanks for the headsup
DIY,not_removed,ill see what i can do when i get back in town i basically just went to httpboxmakerrahulboticscom and delete one side then remove all the tabs associated with that takes a little work but i have customized boxes to hold my stuff
DIY,not_removed,httpsenwikipediaorgwikimediumdensityfibreboard
DIY,not_removed,oh zou t geen goed idee zijn om gewoon weer op te splitsen dus dat frankrijk het zuidelijke deel krijgt en nederland het noordelijke deel
DIY,not_removed,cheers im definitely feeling inspired by the multiple layers on yours the curves and contrasting patterns work really well i might have to make a box
DIY,not_removed,yeah out of my plan now i am settling on doing a printing project and set my budget to €for hardware adn the rest for software and filament
DIY,not_removed,haha close enough
DIY,not_removed,i recognised the hubo brand stuff so yeah nice job
DIY,not_removed,thanks dude d
DIY,not_removed,awh jammer ik ook niet
DIY,not_removed,oh alright was curious because i had made a box out of wood a while ago and was curious i used an automotive epoxy sticks anything to anything
DIY,not_removed,helemaal niet
DIY,not_removed,you know wood workers make many things like decorative boxes also soon you will be able to laser cut those larger things
DIY,not_removed,i just dont get the purpose of it
DIY,not_removed,beautifully written
DIY,not_removed,i use rolls of carpet film you find at home depot or lowes its for protecting carpet or other flooring during events moving or painting theres two versions one for wood floors thats a bit less sticky thats great for lasering wood that has a finish applied and then a tackier version for carpet thats good for unfinished wood this material is cheaper than masking tape and because its polyethylene its safe to laser it never use anything pvc based
DIY,not_removed,are you working on finished or unfinished wood ive never had an issue either way but ymmv
DIY,not_removed,yep i use birch plywood and vinegar does the trick
DIY,not_removed,send me a pm
DIY,not_removed,be careful the usernamechecks out
DIY,not_removed,works best in pdf but well defined svg can also work
DIY,not_removed,you can download it on my site httpsstevenrkmgithubio
DIY,not_removed,i dont have cad files for this i work with svg or pdf you can find the plans over here httpsstevenrkmgithubio its easy to modify with something like inkscape be sure to send some pictures of the result would love to see them and you can also donate on that site helps me out a bit cheers
DIY,not_removed,read the album captions
DIY,not_removed,as a quilter this makes me cringe and a little stabby however i have made quilts for pets two very different levels of work money skill and time involved
DIY,not_removed,the amount of work hours upon hours it takes to make a good sized square quilt is tremendous theyre rightfully upset especially if the person who made it is no longer alive id murder the person who destroyed the quilt my mother made me
DIY,not_removed,you should still feel bad and they still have reason to be bitter about it quilts can take an insane amount of time to make
DIY,not_removed,yes assuming its smaller rolling up a queen sized quilt could be a pain in the ass
DIY,not_removed,also avoid folding quilts in half its better to do it in thirds reason is that folding in half will cause stress in the same spot but folding in thirds means the creases vary in location a bit each time i fold mine in half but i made it so im allowed to treat it poorly if i want
DIY,not_removed,unless you live in antarctica you probably do have a fab lab in your country check out the full list here httpswwwfablabsiolabs hope youre close enough to stop by one theyre great pm me if you need more info
DIY,not_removed,yeah ive been looking into a good paper cutter and this perfectly describes why ill never buy the cricut
DIY,not_removed,the code is of course very dirty i have put it in a gist you can probably work it out
DIY,not_removed,i will be messaging you on utc to local time to remind you of day to send a pm to also be reminded and to reduce spam parent commenter can httpnpredditcommessagecomposetoremindmebotsubjectdelete commentmessagedelete dbuwzaw dont forget to add the time options after the of
DIY,not_removed,well i used it as a huge inspiration but i did do the full work myself sure people can have my file the quality of the etsy one is of course way better they use better materials and finish and i encourage people to check that out if they want to buy one thats also the reason i dont sell the plans hope this is ok they are an inspiration
DIY,not_removed,thanks missy pm me we can maybe work something out
DIY,not_removed,there is a fablab at the university where you can freely use the lasercutters if you have a university card its close to arenberg castle
DIY,not_removed,yeah here are places like that you should look around maybe a fablab or hackerspace some have very cool stuff like big cncs and all
DIY,not_removed,i work in a library and we have a maker space still fairly rare in the library world but there are some out there we have an epilog laser which we teach people to use to make some interesting projects
DIY,not_removed,its a place where you can go and diy your projects search fablab makerspace or hackerspaces like said in a comment below it depends on the type of lab some are free for members and some of them have a membership payment theres no such thing near me
DIY,not_removed,usually when people say makerspace they mean some sort of cooperative but there are membershipbased sorts of places httpwwwtechshopws is one in the us and you can get memberships or buy oneoff entry looks like theyre offering buy one give one year memberships right now so if you have a buddy interested you could split the cost or you could give a membership but i dont like anyone that much
DIY,not_removed,he means cooperattive work space just a translation issue where the english translation direct isnt as correct as it should be source american living in belgium who doesnt even blink twice when these translations happen to the point i sometimes make the same mistake now
DIY,not_removed,minutes on a nice laser cutter in a maker space probably more like
DIY,not_removed,thanks for the info
DIY,not_removed,if not all spots are taken up by students drove several times to that fablab for this box times without any luck that sucked
DIY,not_removed,eithr treat it or soak it afterwards i soak it for minutes or so in a sealed bag shake it up and get the loose burnt material off sometimes ill do it replacing the dirty liquid with new liquid
DIY,not_removed,wow that is a very beautiful piece must have taken a lot of time to get right in your design too bad etching does not work well with yours but i do find it not always working that well on mdf too little contrast with the layers so i tend to avoid it i did have some great results where the inner layer was very dark it looked beautiful when etched
DIY,not_removed,yeah that is kind of what i do i use httpwwwmakercasecom as a base for adjusting to my needs works great
DIY,not_removed,dat zou het zo veel makkelijker maken dan kom ik wel bij jullie wonen
DIY,not_removed,printing is also nice you can probably buy a nice printer for that money im a bit unfamiliar with printers though
DIY,not_removed,thanks yes that gave me away
DIY,not_removed,guess that could work too bit more aggressive i guess d but im definitively not an expert in glues or epoxy
DIY,not_removed,yeah but it was the best thing google could do dutch matthias overpronounces the i
DIY,not_removed,not really lasers char wood that is too thick take a piece of hard wood and put it in a laser the wood will catch on fire as its cutting through it
DIY,not_removed,i think its just a box i dont really get it either i mean it looks cool though
DIY,not_removed,thanks ill try to find some at my home depot im always interested in finding a better solution another pro tip for engraving glass theres a type of film called frisket film which is lightly adhesive but really controls the micro explosions on the glass surface to give a really crisp and detailed finish you need to up your laser power by about or so to compensate but it works like a charm its also not pvc based so its safe also a company called grafix sells it along with other stencil films which can be used for cutting and engraving as many of them are not pvc papermylar etc
DIY,not_removed,i dont have a laser cutter but whats wrong with pvc
DIY,not_removed,i dont have a laser cutter but whats wrong with pvc
DIY,not_removed,both and a lot of different woods and even plastics on one of the woods i tried the moisture left stains and then the other problem was that the burn resistance it gave as a protective medium was unpredictable it was just way easier and quicker to use on of my tape rolls on the surface and the results were incredibly quantifiable
DIY,not_removed,hmmm ill have to give it a go thanks i typically use aircraft ply which is birch so it should work
DIY,not_removed,can i get a copy just for the sake of having a copy i just love artsy stuff dont care if its a ball of yarn or a box of chocolate if its remotely pretty it must be in my house even if no one else sees it
DIY,not_removed,my mother in law just gave my wife a king size double wedding ring quilt that has over pieces it took her months to make and shes retired so she worked on it most every day i dont even like having it on the bed to be honest i feel like it should be hanging on a wall behind glass
DIY,not_removed,i think you have the people in this story flipped
DIY,not_removed,there are two in my country but that still means away darn australia is wide
DIY,not_removed,yeah a friend and i kickstarted the glowforge but we are seriously considering to cancel the quality of the machine does not seem to live up to it the muse of fsl looks better and more robust as a direct competitor
DIY,not_removed,thanks stoopid question but just to be sure you actually wrote the coffeescript and then compiled it to javascript havent come across coffee before and just wanted to make sure ive understood whats going on here
DIY,not_removed,yeah ive heard of it its also why i didnt just consider this project wholly out of reach
DIY,not_removed,are there in places like this in the gentoudenaarde region not something i need but always have crazy project ideas in my head and a cnc laser system to rent would be handy
DIY,not_removed,quite the contrary its very common to see libraries incorporate some sort of maker lab to maintain relevancy
DIY,not_removed,i did not do a translation d it is actually called a makerspace like a hackerspace and is indeed a place where you can go and use tools for some price or free
DIY,not_removed,it took minutes the inner box with all the small rectangles takes most of that time generally cutting is fast and engraving is pretty slow the effect of engraving is also not always that good with most mdf imho so i tend to avoid it and just cut
DIY,not_removed,ohh cool thank you
DIY,not_removed,looks much better than my solution thanks for the link
DIY,not_removed,yeah i am currently exploring printing but i need to find good communities so far i found some good ones on youtube
DIY,not_removed,ma as in mardi gras tthi as in tea as as in was thats the best way i can explain it i think greetings from gelderland
DIY,not_removed,google pronounces it the best using dutch and matjas
DIY,not_removed,i am going to agree with you all at the cost of my karma however when i scanned through the pics i was like i hope you put a cheque in it or something here i made you a box
DIY,not_removed,thats a might fine tip i dont laser much glass but maybe one day i will i have cut ham with the laser which then went into a sandwich
DIY,not_removed,it gives off very hazardous fumes when its burnedmelted i cant remember what off the top of my head but a quick google should tell you what you want to know you should never ever burn or melt pvc because its extremely toxic and bad for youthe environment
DIY,not_removed,pvc is polyvinyl chloride its the chloride part thats the problem the laser turns this into chlorine gas and then that forms hydrochloric acid when it meets moisture in the air which is very corrosive to the machine and your lungs dioxins are also released im not a chemist so do your own research but this was how it was explained to me when i purchased the machine
DIY,not_removed,oh no no i use the paper towel to wipe off the wood after burning not to protect it during wood doesnt need additional protection except to possibly mask for smoke and usually not even then the only time i use paper to protect the surface of something is when im etching on glass and i use soaking wet newspaper then because it causes the etch to happen smoothly and insulate the surrounding area preventing chips from forming in the etched area
DIY,not_removed,if its remotely pretty it must be in my house you must have a big house
DIY,not_removed,heh i was just thinking my magic cards would rest in that fine if the dimensions were right
DIY,not_removed,two types of people
DIY,not_removed,shrink it down convert to obj and itd be a pretty easy to print as well
DIY,not_removed,i didnt read that as dice cut a hole in the box
DIY,not_removed,but it wasnt made to be a wall hanging and she could have created one of those if she had wanted that a quilt is meant to be used and lived with some wear and fading means its become part of your lives and i think that is what your mil intended its an awesome present
DIY,not_removed,i choose to believe the poster is an introspective reformed shitbag
DIY,not_removed,same but almost for me
DIY,not_removed,any technical school or university around you of you ask nicely you may be lucky
DIY,not_removed,yes i did write it in coffeescript and compiled it to js so you dont really need the coffee file but it can be a bit more readable than the compiled js
DIY,not_removed,in gent there is the awesome timelab but they are having some issues with their location and politics hope they can fix that soon otherwise that is one of the coolest maker spaces in belgium they are very active and have lots of nice tools
DIY,not_removed,id say its more like the ma in map than mardi gras i grew up in new orleans and mardi has a long a sound to the short a sound of map on the other hand how its would be said in limburg verses other parts of belgium that gets a little pedantic
DIY,not_removed,i am going to agree with you all at the cost of my karma sure are a lot of salty downvotes here reddit we love you as long as you agree with us
DIY,not_removed,chlorine gas corrodes your lungs and also metal in the machine
DIY,not_removed,thats what im getting at a lot of people online suggest to use damp paper on the wood while engraving cutting as a protection against the burn vapor stains ive never been able to make work reliably ive never tried rubbing off the burn stains due to the fact i go for prevention instead of cure etc and worse comes to worse a light sand with grit does the job
DIY,not_removed,yeah its called the universe
DIY,not_removed,i was thinking that the card corners would stuck with so many holes
DIY,not_removed,mom
DIY,not_removed,a quilt is meant to be used and lived with as the so of a quilting addict can verify
DIY,not_removed,but wouldnt map sound the same as step that wouldnt be correct either right
DIY,not_removed,yep and hydrochloric acid is the vaporized liquid it emits which literally eats everything from metal to plastic so your laser will die
DIY,not_removed,yeah i havent tried it my laser bed is and the jobs vary but usually i just do a quick wipe off afterwards instead of trying to cover the surface with masking tape
DIY,not_removed,but then you dont need a copy since this box is already in the universe
DIY,not_removed,that analogy could work phonetics isnt my strong suit but for me mateaus is the best way i would say it again lots of variation in ways people say things here so im sure both would work
DIY,not_removed,epilog eh im on a full spectrum gen x ill try the wipe off and see what happens the masking tape thing on glass is worth it though the only problem is finding the really wide tape i found one thats wide so it just takes seconds to apply and the results are perfect
DIY,not_removed,try the wet newspaper trick on glass youll be surprised at the results
DIY,not_removed,in addition to the other means of support you come up with could you just mix up a batch of mortar to a consistency that is fairly thick put down a blob of it under where the tub will go and push it down into place level it as normal once it dries your tub will be solid
DIY,not_removed,you can either level the floor with wood or cement filler or cut the front lip so it rests evenly cutting will highlight the fact that something isnt level and will also make a mess but it may be easier than leveling the floor if the entire bathroom isnt flat
DIY,not_removed,im going to use a construction phrase here shim it put extra boards battens whatever you need to down so that its level i find trips to local plumbing supply stores that i trust to be useful they can recommend advice or products without doing the whole songdance sales pitch on the exterior of the tub put up a moulding panel tile prefab material custom whatever to hide the gap if you choose a pattern or diagonal stripes it will be harder to see that the tub edge is not square to the floor even though it will be level but it will stand out more than the current color scheme
DIY,not_removed,this is the typical way of fixing this issue
DIY,not_removed,i cant level the whole floor because that just moves the problem to the door could i cut a groove out of the plywood for the apron edge to sit in
DIY,not_removed,so you recommend shims and wood instead of mortar or plaster to set the tub in i plan on putting tile on the rest of the floor schluter says that ditra can go over vinyl but i could rip it up
DIY,not_removed,at this point you are basically in no mans land so yes out of curiosity how it the floor even that unlevel the joists arent really higher on one side are they

DIY,not_removed,a family room without a tv i didnt know that was a thing on a serious note looks nice
DIY,not_removed,doing something very similar soon nice job saved this post for future reference
DIY,not_removed,very nice is the step a concrete slab if so how did you do the concrete slab did you create the slab elsewhere and then put it on the frame or did you put the concrete directly into the frame with an edge and remove the edge later any tips would be greatly appreciated
DIY,not_removed,info on the lights also are they plugged in to a hidden outlet
DIY,not_removed,looks great would you mind sharing the kind of faux stone you used
DIY,not_removed,i was made aware that this is the formal living room and in such rooms television is forbidden
DIY,not_removed,i could go into elaborate detail or just share the youtube video i watched it was poured in my garage cured for days sanded sealed and placed with some construction adhesive it overhangs the stacked stone by about httpwwwdiypetecomhowtobuildaconcretetable
DIY,not_removed,it is an electric fireplace made by dynasty it does put out heat link is below
DIY,not_removed,these are the lights i chose on amazon but there are many other kits out there you will need a splitter between the strips and the power supply to allow one remote to control both sides simultaneously it is not included in this kit you can cut the strips to the length you need i did have to relocate an outlet to the center of the room that is now behind the fireplace so that the plugs for the fireplace insert and the lights would be concealed ltrop reels waterproof flexible rgb led strip light kit color changing leds led strip kit mini ir controller power supply
DIY,not_removed,these are the premade corners i purchased from a place called floor decor these are similar to the x panels i purchased from the same location they do not have the same exact color scheme i used also named beachwalk online
DIY,not_removed,such a waste of space those things are
DIY,not_removed,thanks for the info looks great btw
DIY,not_removed,wow how the hell did you complete this without him knowing kudos all the way around nice job
DIY,not_removed,i guess i should have mentioned that hes already a workout fanatic and lifts weights days a week for the last years i was definitely not hinting at anything
DIY,not_removed,a youre a keeper b that is the most rfitness home gym i have seen yet
DIY,not_removed,such a nice thing to do for your husband great work
DIY,not_removed,very innovative would have lived to seen his reaction
DIY,not_removed,just one more addition to make this more like a real gym have a family member do chores and chat on their phone inside the squat rack and pretend not to see hes waiting to use it
DIY,not_removed,thats great love the main power box and i like how you added the rubber flooring makes a world of difference in a home gym

DIY,not_removed,what an incredible job youve done you get best wife of the award this year im pretty sure

DIY,not_removed,damn wish my wife would do something like this for me
DIY,not_removed,you should have waited about minutes before taking the photo with the clock in it
DIY,not_removed,are you two two gay guys
DIY,not_removed,i was just goint to ask where the hell the punching bag was but i guess your man knows what hes doing my husband has added a standing punch bag however like most of us hes probably not going to use it much if not even touch it at all xd haha anyway really impressive work amazing job
DIY,not_removed,is this your subtle way of telling him he is fat
DIY,not_removed,wheres the neck machine just kidding but seriously times out people go to the gym just to get out of the house and have some time to themselves i wouldnt be too psyched if i had to give up my nice gym and have to work out in a dank basement
DIY,not_removed,now imagine if he had bought you a treadmill
DIY,not_removed,the sweetest way to call your spouse fat
DIY,not_removed,well i told him i was working on a project for his birthday and so he promised not to go in there i never worked on it while he was around so i guess it helped him forget about it and thanks so much
DIY,not_removed,perhaps he will need more than just plates then haha
DIY,not_removed,i was going to say this is exactly what my home gym looked like before an unrelated shoulder surgery and all he would really need over time would be more weight but im sure he knows that based on this comment nice job looks killer edit i actually read the captions instead of just looking at the pictures you got lowbudget creative and everything works really well thats fucking awesome
DIY,not_removed,yeah i just scrolled down holy shit assumptions through the roof this is a really amazing thing youve accomplished for your husband sorry some people are feeling very bitter
DIY,not_removed,you ded
DIY,not_removed,absolutely speechless it was so great to watch his wideeyed expression he couldnt believe id done all the work myself and been able to keep such a secret too it was awesome
DIY,not_removed,exactly what i thought
DIY,not_removed,its not the greatest given that it is a basement room with no window or hvac vent but open the door and run a little fan and all is good
DIY,not_removed,what is this
DIY,not_removed,thanks so much and nope i just watch a stupid amount of diyhgtv
DIY,not_removed,so all up it was spent of that on the lifting equipment power cage was bench was a cheap one at bowflex dumbbells were olympic weights set incl barbell was i think i paid shipping for either the cage or the weights i cant remember which everything bought thru amazon i hope that helps
DIY,not_removed,if youre paying for a gym membership a power rack would pay for itself in about a year or so if you canceled the gym membership
DIY,not_removed,here you go not too much different though httpimgurcomaouhmc
DIY,not_removed,haha definitely not hes been a workout fiend for years strongest person i know it always frustrates him when he cant get to the gym for whatever reason this was a way of letting him workout whenever he wants
DIY,not_removed,i got rid of my gym membership to work out at home because i have netflix and i can wear as little or as much clothing as i want
DIY,not_removed,i dont know where youre getting your numbers but that certainly isnt true i dont know anyone who actually likes the public setting of a gym and those who can work out at home do
DIY,not_removed,how long did it take
DIY,not_removed,his soul is in the reddits now
DIY,not_removed,nope all about that reddit beginner ppl for that jacked and tanned look
DIY,not_removed,i like to close all the doors and smell my own musk
DIY,not_removed,you could probably add an additional supplyreturn to the room from the hvac ductwork in relatively short order
DIY,not_removed,i was just asking because i think it would be cool to see his reaction like how surprised he is
DIY,not_removed,cool
DIY,not_removed,helps very much and great job on the project thanks
DIY,not_removed,awesome job great idea and amazing how you did it all yourself only advicesuggestion i would have would be if you decide to get more weights check craigslist or if you have a local used sporting goods store in your area weights are an item that many people buy and dont stick with you can get used weights pretty cheap
DIY,not_removed,working out at home is much more convenient and cheaper more time for family and such
DIY,not_removed,well there goes my lunch
DIY,not_removed,two months or so
DIY,not_removed,typo dedded me
DIY,not_removed,thanks so much and yes i had been looking on craigslist the whole time hoping i wouldnt have to buy the plates brand new unfortunately none of the ones for sale in our area were decent andor i got a sketchy vibe from the dudes selling hard to be a small female going looking at weights luckily hubs already had a bunch of random stuff that he has since added into the room so i knew i didnt need to get too much
DIY,not_removed,id apologize but you werent invited anyway

DIY,not_removed,if he used a heavyweight plastic and taped all the seams i dont think more plastic or felt would be helpful the plastic is there to prevent moisture from coming up through the porous concrete if you have more than a bit of dampness then youd have to reevaluate the installation really wet environments should have an air gap to allow moisture the chance to evaporate one such product is dricore

DIY,not_removed,cut with the good side down that way the blade will be cutting in the up stroke and make a smoother cut use a saw guide anything straight and sturdy a length of pine works good use a new carbide blade doesnt really need to be a fine tooth but fine equals a smooth cut besure to use eye protection that stuff hurts to cut
DIY,not_removed,do you have a picture of the material laminate could mean a few different things and none of them should be breaking a saw blade
DIY,not_removed,dewalt circular saw do you mean a circular saw is it a cordless saw battery powered tools may not have enough power if the battery is weak a properly running circular saw with the correct sharp blade should slice right through what you pictured
DIY,not_removed,maybe a silly question but did you check that the saw blade is rotating in the correct direction
DIY,not_removed,im not sure if these will work for you let me know if you need additional pictures
DIY,not_removed,sorry im kinda of a noob when it comes to power tools and no it uses a power cable and im actually not sure if its i just typed what my dad told me to
DIY,not_removed,that literally happened the first time but we fixed it
DIY,not_removed,yes thats chipparticle board and the laminated surface is actually called melamine it is definitely a bitch to cut through and it will dull blades relatively quickly but it shouldnt be breaking anything and millions of people cut it every day i would guess he had a defective blade since it broke however a laminate blade is not a blade for chipboard im assuming the blade thats not cutting well is i believe you generally want a with being better ive cut lots of this stuff with blades no problem but just get a relatively cheap blade since youre going to wear it out faster on this stuff pro tip use blue masking tape over the cutting line on the side thats going to be facing up when you install the top as melamine has a tendency to chip when cutting the tape will stop most of that with a circular saw your good surface should be face down while cutting
DIY,not_removed,its not even mdf its chip board
DIY,not_removed,didnt look close enough at the second pic this is accurate and i updated my post my recommendations are the same
DIY,not_removed,damn fine wedding gift you made there
DIY,not_removed,thats not a chipthats broken replace the pane before the cracks spread and you have shards of glass on the floor and in your feet single pane glass is pretty cheap and easy to replace if you can get the sash out take it to a glass shop shouldnt cost more than to replace if its a standard size wide ish pane
DIY,not_removed,i tried looking for repair kits but i only found some car windshields one not sure if it will work or not no they wont
DIY,not_removed,nope a new pane of glass is the only way to go
DIY,not_removed,get glass cut and put it in yourself about windows stores will do it if you bring the window to them
DIY,not_removed,source i do this everyday im a glazier looks to be an insulated unitthat crack is right over a muntin white grids inside the window you need to get the entire unit replaced or it will look like crap in a short amount of time insulated units are panes of glass with a spacer in betweenand also muntins like your window air and moisture is pulled out before the unit is put together simply cutting the broken piece out and glueing a new one on will not be totally sealed and moisture will cause discoloring and streaking very quickly they are usually around to us to replace also the reason windshield kits wont work is because windshields are laminated glass basically thin pieces with a plastic type sheet in the middle windshield repair kits use an epoxy to reseal the crack using the laminate layer as a base to stick toif you can understand regular window panes dont have anything for the epoxy to hold to and will just drip down the back side

DIY,not_removed,this is great man been looking to do this for a while now i might
DIY,not_removed,that seems like it would drastically restrict airflow through the psu which is already one of the hotter components in modern computers have you checked the difference in temperature inside the psu are you worried about overheating or damaging the psu components
DIY,not_removed,psu intakes air from the bottom and expels hot air out of the back it doesnt need any airflow at all from the inside of the case unless you have a less modern case that doesnt have vents on the bottom then youd have to mount a psu upside down to intake air from the inside of the case and in that case yeah youd absolutely not be able to do this
DIY,not_removed,i didnt see a fan grill on the psu in your video i didnt know that was the current trend thanks for the info

DIY,not_removed,a better way to do this is a string and two fucking nails
DIY,not_removed,way to take artistic and watermarked shots of a grade woodshop project ya fuckin fruit
DIY,not_removed,dont wear cheap sunglasses for longer than a month after that they arnt protecting you from uv rays most cheap sunglasses uv protection is a thin film on the outside of the lens that wears off quickly once it has worn off the glasses only dialate your pupils and allow the uv light in your better off not wearing anything than to wear cheap ones longer than a month or buy some high quality glasses with uv protection built into the lens
DIY,not_removed,about it was some preprimed molding from home depot
DIY,not_removed,if you really have that much of a problem with it go donate bucks to a world relief charity
DIY,not_removed,it is a fujifilm which has a fixed lens
DIY,not_removed,youve not been around internet making things threads before have you
DIY,not_removed,its a reddit thing
DIY,not_removed,i came here to post this thank you
DIY,not_removed,yes they most likely do the cheapo china crap works just as well as ray bans contrary to what some ray ban seller would tell you watch the video ave did on it if you want proof
DIY,not_removed,i guess youve never used lightroom
DIY,not_removed,define cheap and whats your source
DIY,not_removed,right for the wrong reasons
DIY,not_removed,just pointing out the effort and resources expended for cheap sunglasses its a little odd if you think about it but if the project brought some pleasure to op then it was worth it
DIY,not_removed,yup always obligatory cat pics
DIY,not_removed,i dont get your question but ive used the internet since the aol days
DIY,not_removed,im not saying you need ray bans heck im not even saying you need to spend on sunglasses just at least get something with a sticker on it rat claims some level of uv resistance ive gone through plenty of chilis and peppers in my day were talking about your eyeballs here you dont ever get to replace them regarding that video hes using a source which doesnt tell us a whole lot about the and shorter range which is considered more dangerous to your vision you can just assume that his results extrapolate throughout the uv range if you want but id prefer to stick to something with a standards organization to back it up
DIY,not_removed,yeah so setting aside the debate about uv shielding of cheap sunglasses the theory is this no glasses pupils constrict eyes squint uv admitted into your eyeball is limited but your pupils react to visible light so if you block visible light without blocking uv your pupils get larger to admit more visible light and then let in a crapton of uv which is very bad
DIY,not_removed,explanation is a little wishy washy but the sentiment is generally correct
DIY,not_removed,cheap being anything from the gas station wal mart dollar shades at the mall anything built like shit cheap plastic lenses not real polycarbonate or nylon these glasses are just shitty layers of plastic glued together so much distortion in the lenses my source is ive been in the eyewear industry for years and i know quality there are also ways to test uv protection on glasses and all of the cheap pairs i have ever tried fail miserably pugs are by far the worst popular gas station glasses where im from these are your eyes we are talking about they are one of the most important ways you interact with the world around you protect them right so many of my clients have major eye damage from years of wearing cheap sunglasses you are better off not wearing anything your body has defense mechanisms you squint to restrict the amount of light coming your pupils restrict also only downside is squinting all day can cause head aches crows feet ect
DIY,not_removed,what would you like me to say go buy raybans cuz they are sick as fuh or because some are glass lenses and they are incredibly scratch resistant made out of actual acetate and have amazing clarity and detail
DIY,not_removed,whats your explanation for this video then
DIY,not_removed,no youre correct that cheap glasses do not provide adequate uv protection but your explanation of a cheap film breaking down rapidly seems to lack a basis in common knowledge nor did you provide support for it what is true is that some cheap sunglasses just straight dont protect against uv at all right off the shelf
DIY,not_removed,nm not and shorter limited sample size uncalibrated nontraceable sensor arbitrary massive em test power
DIY,not_removed,can you cite a more legitimate source for such a test then
DIY,not_removed,i would steer gently away from a hardwood ceiling in your car few reasons if your car has a high centre of gravity it will possibly lend to a bit of instability also wood expands and contracts and in a car the temp flux is almost constant example in winter its cold you get in it heats up you get out its cold on and on the roof being the poorest insulated portion of the car however there are still things you can do if you dont want fabric you can paint the ceiling ive seen it done like wise you can do something like wicker or plad keep in mind that fabric also absorbed a fair bit of noise perhaps you can go to joann fabrics and see if there is something you like if you can take out the headliner yourself and bring it to a shop with the fabric the costs of having it done will go down significantly
DIY,not_removed,it doesnt sound safe
DIY,not_removed,rather than fight with spraying in adhesives and pushing the headliner up against it id had the idea to replace the headliner with some of that snap in flooring let me get this straight installing flooring upside down on a car roof somehow sounds easier to you than spraying some glue out of an aerosol can
DIY,not_removed,i dont have any advice im just wondering what kind of car it is also would like to see pics
DIY,not_removed,super by it is a spray adhesive since it is a smaller truck you should be able to take the headliner out completely then with it out and depending how you look at the world right side up you should be able to completely separate the fabric from the backer go find some fabric you like do not trim yet spray the backer and let dry to a slightly tacky finish then spray the fabric again let it dry to a tacky finish lay the fabric over the backing and you may need a second pair of hands to keep from getting wrinkles then you will want to press it all together you dont need to go all hulk buster on it just run your hands over it until you have stuck the entire piece together then take your time and trim away the excess leaving an inch or two over hang flip the piece over and spray the over hang and about the same with of the back of the backer yeah i am on mobile so this probably reads like a year old wrote it
DIY,not_removed,my car has carpet as the roof kinda odd but i bought that way and its kinda cool
DIY,not_removed,its a pickup truck a smaller one as far as pick ups go and yeah i was thinking something like that snap in flooring might be a bit heavy nor would it have the give to match the curve of the roof hence the thin plywood idea someone else has suggested bamboo and that has me intrigued my brother put a furry cow pattern in his vw passat id consider shag carpet as an alternative but my wife would veto that in a heartbeat
DIY,not_removed,why would that be
DIY,not_removed,yep ive done it before on other cars it was a mess and it failed again eventually anyways i may have screwed up application somehow but i followed the instructions id rather try something that i could be more certain was going to actually adhere to the roof of the vehicle also it would look fairly unique
DIY,not_removed,regular staples or staple gun staples
DIY,not_removed,nissan frontier pickup truck
DIY,not_removed,oooh thanks those look awesome will definitely need to consider using bamboo
DIY,not_removed,yeah thats the sort of thing i needed to know about thanks
DIY,not_removed,a nissan frontier pickup truck
DIY,not_removed,heh from another comment in this thread i briefly contemplated shag carpet as an alternative id imagine a thick tight weave carpet might help with noise reduction maybe provide some insulation as well
DIY,not_removed,i was just thinking of what it would do in an accident
DIY,not_removed,yea you definitely screwed up the install ive done probably dozen headliners and none have ever drooped again at least in the decades that i still know where the cars are use the right glue apply it right and its good to go
DIY,not_removed,the carpet in mine is pretty thin maybe a a quarter inch or threeeigths thick shag carpet might be interesting but i would imagine itd get hard to work with at some point best of luck though
DIY,not_removed,hm good point sharp wooden bits jabbing down from above do tend not to be a good thing
DIY,not_removed,any guides online that youd recommend im not opposed to keeping a cloth headliner ill admit im a bit enamored of the idea of having a wood headliner instead of a cloth one just for the uniqueness factor but if it turns out to be too expensive for the wife to sign off on then ill need to look at doing this way
DIY,not_removed,remove the headliner from the car meaning the headliner itself not just the fabric prep the headliner being sure to get all the old foam off and scuff with sandpaper apply super per the can multiple coats then apply the fabric making sure to press firmly across the entire panel let cure for hours outside of the car then reinstall
DIY,not_removed,thanks
DIY,not_removed,your existing piping is supposed to go over the periscope vent opening it doesnt matter what way you do it as long as its sealed
DIY,not_removed,did you watch their install video
DIY,not_removed,buy a pipe crimper its in the hvac aisle and crimp the hell out of it and it will go in
DIY,not_removed,the male end of the pipe always point outside whenever possible to avoid lint buildup at the joint
DIY,not_removed,go back to lowes and buy one that fits
DIY,not_removed,ah i see the issue now i just have an old metal pipe coming out my wall this video shows an additional attachment placed over the pipe screwed into the wall thank you for the link
DIY,not_removed,dryer vent piping comes od nominal they dont sell dryer vent piping the connecting end of the pipe should be just under od so it fits inside the pipe youre connecting it too
DIY,not_removed,the main problem youll face is that tvs normally have quite a few holes for ventilation without which they will die from lack of circulation to do it properly youd have to look at installing some sort of heat sink to keep things cool because of the water it might be as simple as sealing those breather holes with a combination of aluminium and silicon
DIY,not_removed,one of the main differences that you may encounter is that a tv manufactured for outdoor uses a conformal coating on its inside printed circuit board pcb you can do everything else recommended in the threads within but your tv may not last a long outdoors because the pcb will likely oxidizerust quicker hope this helps good luck with your project
DIY,not_removed,if you are going to do that i would recommend leaving the vent holes open and maybe getting some sort of grillac cover or a tv cover if you can find one to put over it when not in use this will prevent water from getting in and maybe reduce the risk of a bug getting inside and frying something
DIY,not_removed,weve done this but it was under an awning and we used a cover central ac unit cover i think when it wasnt in use i wouldnt try this without an awning of some sort
DIY,not_removed,also make sure not to place it in direct sunlight as that will slowly destroy the screen really cold night are also bad for it
DIY,not_removed,plexiglass enclosure with an intake fan one side and an exhaust on the other ive seen it down back before they had fancy outdoor lcds
DIY,not_removed,had you thought about buying a cheap disposable tv the prices have dropped so low that you can hang it outdoors and when it fails throw it in the trash
DIY,not_removed,you could use a super hydrophobic spray check out hydrobeadcom
DIY,not_removed,im thinking about keeping the vent holes by making a surround that is open towards the ground but would keep rain out however most enclosures ive seen dont do anything for air circulation which was a bit surprising im guessing enough ambient air and they are fine
DIY,not_removed,thats what im going to use im just trying to find a way that the first rain wont destroy it
DIY,not_removed,great idea im on it
DIY,not_removed,im assuming they probably just make enough room for there to still be some sort of circulation youd have to do some research into whether those enclosures reduce the life of the tv at all
DIY,not_removed,you are close you want talcum powder for a wood floor if that does not help reach out to the installer
DIY,not_removed,thanks for the reply off to walgreens
DIY,not_removed,if you are determined to keep all the nonchipped veneer i would go with your idea of making a straight cut above the chipped area and removing the old veneer below the cut use a fresh xacto blade and a really straight steel ruler as a guide trying to exactly match the existing veneer after you strip the old finish lightly sand and use paste wood filler on any gouges and scratch might be tough so i my opt for a contrasting wood type to replace the chipped stuff you removed then just refinish as you like with some kind of polyurethane or shellac if you are feeling fancy edit spelling
DIY,not_removed,one trick is to buy similar old veneer furniture that it perhaps beyond repair and remove the closest matching veneer from it and make the transfer your chest appears to be a waterfall art deco piece which at least in the eastern us is still readily available you can find similar veneer colors and patterns on hope chests chest of drawers night stands tables and even record players and radios from the era also if the chest has a smell put a couple of boxes of baking soda in the chest the kind with the vents on the side used in refrigerators and close the lid the longer the better months even does wonders
DIY,not_removed,you could also replace the veneer with metal plating that matches the hardware
DIY,not_removed,you can rent a tow behind lift from a rental store expect to pay for a half day rental
DIY,not_removed,or rent some scaffolding about for a weekend where i live

DIY,not_removed,i would go with the glue just make sure its a glue that bonds both the planks and the subfloor under it with the right glue should work
DIY,not_removed,sorry i dont have any suggestions but i am planning to have the same product installed in the entire downstairs area kitchen living room bath dining area total is almost square feet so far three estimates run from to for almost square feet including product i wish i could diy and save some duckets good luck and post pictures when you are done
DIY,not_removed,price for the product only is per sq foot to install is per sq foot presuming its the clickandlock type glue down would be at a higher rate which i wasnt quoted on what was your cost if you have any links to share about your research i would appreciate it
DIY,not_removed,it looks like there is a method to meet the perpendicular planks you could always call mannington and ask for guidance
DIY,not_removed,after some more research it looks like people do not recommend the click lock installation type for these lvps what is your price per sqft for materials
DIY,not_removed,im still going around getting quotes ive read so many reviews that counter each other in regards to glue vs click lock type of installs ill try to find the links
DIY,not_removed,first check if there is a filter on the front usually there is a small panel underneath the door clean that out first have some towels handy then you can buy some commercial cleaners like affresh or tide washing machine cleaner they are mostly bleach but they seem to work better than straight bleach probably because they are solid so they release slowly over time bleach and vinegar are both good for defunking but dont mix them togetheruse one or the other the other thing to check is the door seal wipe that down with a bleach or vinegar soaked paper towel if there is any solid debris in there get it out if you have pets the hair often accumulates around the door to keep it from smelling leave the door open after you are done with laundry at least until the tub and door are completely dry leaving it open all the time is your best bet but i know a lot laundry rooms are in areas you have to walk past also do the tub cleaning about once a month and dont forget to keep that filter clean too hopefully this helps
DIY,not_removed,vinegar thats how i get smells out of my clothes especially if i forgot i was doing laundry
DIY,not_removed,bleach
DIY,not_removed,canesten sells a laundry product that kills fungus and spores you could try putting a decent dose of that through it bleach works as well but stinks and doesnt necessarily kill all the spores if that doesnt workyou may need to take it apart and clean it the old fashioned way
DIY,not_removed,we purchased identical front load washers for the two rental units we had after years one machine reeked of mildew and the other didnt the difference between both was that the tenant who had the machine that didnt stink kept the door open all the time and the stinky machine was always kept closed besides always using the recommended low suds he detergent and not using too much i strongly suggest keeping the door of your frontload open all the time and wiping dry the door seals after every wash also make sure the door seal drains are always free of gunk as for your already musty machine try to clean out the door seals and the seal drain holes then blast it with bleach
DIY,not_removed,front load or top load washer
DIY,not_removed,im not sure about getting rid of the smell but the mildew smell was something we were concerned about when buying a frontloader the salesperson told us to use powder detergent because the liquid detergent is gummy and sticks around and causes that mildew we havent had any problems years later using powder detergent also we leave the washer door cracked open and try to wipe down the rubber on the inside when we are done with loads
DIY,not_removed,my front load lg washer developed that smell after a few months we tried a lot of things the stuff in the laundry aisle at the grocery worked but the small came back i had been using unscented liquid detergent but read a post that said powder detergent wouldnt smell i bought unscented he powdered detergent and the smell went away for good a few months ago i came across a good deal on major brand unscented liquid a couple of months and the smell returned i bought tide unscented powdered detergent the next day smell gone again i am using up the liquid but every load is powdered ive learned my lesson
DIY,not_removed,enzymatic drain treatment it attacks and destroys organic matter not drain cleaner put of enzyme in machine and fill it cold is fine i manipulate the cycle stopping the machine at different intervals only allowing a small amount of water to drain do this many times through the course of a full day until all water is drained run a rinse cycle this is allowing enzymes to somewhat trickle and sit in the drain pipe as well also cleaning them a bit the one i use has a strong pinesol type smell leaves the machine fresh
DIY,not_removed,the class action recall was mentioned it applied to the duet line i think if you have one of those you may be able to get several hundred bucks from the class action also they have a new rubber gasket they will send you that will fix the issue google something like front load washer dryer class action mildew and you should get tons of info
DIY,not_removed,be sure you have a ptrap in the drain pipe that your washer uses even though this sounds elementary lots of folks have this problem and it can be as simple as that maybe your house didnt have one put in when they put the drain in the ptrap will prevent sewer smells from coming back up its necessary also do a empty load of hot water and bleach its what i use in a dishwasher that has been sitting for a while
DIY,not_removed,cleaning vinegar instead of detergent run a couple of loads empty it may help
DIY,not_removed,this
DIY,not_removed,bleach smells like a mothers love
DIY,not_removed,thanks for the advice somehow it didnt occur to me that there were products out there specifically for this found one online that i can buy locally cheers
DIY,not_removed,i seem to only see this is au know of anything for us
DIY,not_removed,oh yeah forgot to mention front load its also build into a cabinet so access behind is a problem if it came to that
DIY,not_removed,unfortunately no anything with a decent percentage of benzylkonium chloride in it will work i use the stuff to clean algae off concrete much higher concentration of course it works if you use it correctly
DIY,not_removed,the issues on these front loaders are sometimes the rubber seal around the opening clean the seal and the doorglass and then remember to wipe it dry after loads we leave our washer door open to prevent the smell from developing
DIY,not_removed,theres numerous guides online about cleaning front loading washers mostly the gasket seal is the source
DIY,not_removed,you might look here

DIY,not_removed,definitely those bristles are plastic theyll melt in a heartbeat look at how some seem longer than others on that photo from the side if they started out flat theyre melted
DIY,not_removed,its probably something like
DIY,not_removed,oh yeah those are melted try verrry carefully cutting up through them with a utility knife

DIY,not_removed,i sail dinghies and i wanted to be able to invite a friend but my current boat a walker bay is too small i wanted to get a bigger boat but didnt want to spend much money so i got a canoe and began prototyping with scrap wood and pvc this is letting me quickly figure out the optimal dimensions and placement of things before spending more money or effort on materials the pvc actually works so well though and is so light strong and durable i may stick with it im going to use the scrap wood pieces that i cut and drilled as templates for the next version which ill seal with something this time to preserve them the parts that i wanted to show here were the outriggers and the tillerrudder which cost something under to make altogether i uploaded a video of and of warning theres some noise towards the end of the sailing video dont have your sound up
DIY,not_removed,awesome build great job
DIY,not_removed,good job
DIY,not_removed,wilson would be proud of you
DIY,not_removed,very cool post thanks for sharing i own a canoe and may try this one day
DIY,not_removed,great ingenuity good job
DIY,not_removed,could you elaborate a bit on the sailrig it self id also like to suggest you try raising the outriggers a few inches so that in your neutral state ie flat water rowing neither are in the water and when stabilizing only one is in the water this will reduce the over all drag somewhat im working on a similar project myself little jealous that youve gotten yours out on the water
DIY,not_removed,nicely done i hadnt though to use a ratchet strap to hold the sail and outrigger plate to the boat but it looks solid and cant really add any drag im going to have to think about that idea
DIY,not_removed,please dont take this the wrongway but this would be great in rshittydiy
DIY,not_removed,be aware that sunlight will eventually make the pvc brittle storing it under cover and painting it should extend its lifespan but keep an eye on it
DIY,not_removed,finished pic first always
DIY,not_removed,right now i just took the sail from my dinghy and put it on an improvised but firm mount i didnt add any cleats or other stuff yet because im not set on where i want stuff to be yet and i just use a httpimgurcomaetnwn to tie off the current makedo mainsheet which isnt rigged but just run through one of the blocks at the moment i used four ubolts to clamp a thick piece of plywood under the front seat of the canoe then i cut another piece of plywood and put it over the gunnels of the canoe and traced outside of the gunnels with a sharpie then i screwed thick strips of wood along those lines so that if you set it on top of the canoe and push backwards it remains very firmly in place then i took and ran them around the front seat of the canoe and over the top of the top piece of wood on both sides of the canoe they hold really well then i added a small piece of wood to the top for reinforcement and screwed that down and then used a hole saw to cut a hole after measuring through both the top and bottom pieces of wood and ran a piece of thick pvc through both httpimgurcomaeatkv i put the outriggers at a compromise position i cant raise or lower them from inside the boat in their current configuration though its not a lot of trouble to go near shore and loosen the pipe clamps that hold them in order to raise or lower them where i could still walk around to boat without risk of falling when i need to take the sail down or raise the rudder etc when i sail i can usually keep the outriggers out of the water unless the wind is stronger or im coming about by leaning a bit to the opposite side without hiking out
DIY,not_removed,theyre not really ratchet straps theyre more like straps that have a cam cleat ratchet straps have too many moving parts and i think they usually rust but havent rusted and they dont seem to have but one moving part i got them at harbor freight and they seem to be zinccoated or something they stay very tight and im going to redo the rowing frame to use them by running them inside the tubes i think they stay tight and theyre simple
DIY,not_removed,yah im torn between calling her the pvsea or liquid plumber now that ive figured out what the dimensions and placement should be i may do some wood or metal work the good thing about the pvc though is that where i sail there are a lot of rocks and oyster shoals that tear stuff up and the pvc is inexpensive last week a wood boat got torn up right by where i was rowing in the video
DIY,not_removed,yah i store the whole thing under a uv resistant tarp under some trees in my yard the sail that im using was actually rolled up and buried in my yard under leaves for years and has the stains to prove it after i got rid of my original dinghy if i hang onto the pvc i may paint it with something like that fusion paint for plastic inside the pvc pole i have a wood pole of the same length that provides the real strength
DIY,not_removed,cool thanks for sharing
DIY,not_removed,awesome function over fashion anyday
DIY,not_removed,my vote if i have one definitely goes to pvsea liquid plumber is a bit redundant

DIY,not_removed,i have a couple comments first very nice job and very professionally done the hot glue on the banana plug binding posts was a good idea and something most people would overlook second epoxying any kind of power supply is a bad idea if the power supply ever dies you want to be able to remove it and replace it velcro would have been a much better idea third another excellent job on recessing the volume knob so it is flush with the wood most people overlook that also fourth soldering is easy just remember two basic things make sure you have as good a mechanical connection between the two wires as possible twist them together second is to let the iron heat up the wires and then use the wires melt the solder not the soldering iron follow those two rules and your soldering will be brilliant in short order fifth to remove dimples in the speaker dust cover get a piece of very sticky tape and wind it around your finger sticky side out
DIY,not_removed,fat bob i am dying
DIY,not_removed,nice job that looks real classy how much does that beast weigh it looks super sturdy
DIY,not_removed,thanks my bad on the epoxied power supply didnt consider replacement soldering will need to be practised i tried the tape method but didnt go for really sticky tape as i was afraid of damaging the cone
DIY,not_removed,whoa i was soldering wrong i usually apply flux on wires get some melted solder on iron and then put it on wires it usually looks good is it actually bad
DIY,not_removed,question for you when i solder smaller wires i was doing it this way but i found that i tended to miss the fine line between heating up the wires too much the covering starts melting and not warm enough for the solder to melt suggestions also it doesnt help that i have a cheap nonadjustable solder iron assuming i got one how do you set the temperature properly as i type this last part i realize i could google it but im curious on your take ive always twisted the wires together and gotten nice clean glossy solders but i may have also been using too much
DIY,not_removed,its my makers mark it goes on a lot of stuff i do
DIY,not_removed,thanks its so not exactly the most portable edit but it is very sturdy
DIY,not_removed,well the point is that the wires have to be hot enough to absorb the solder if the wires arent hot enough youll get crunchy looking solder i know thats not a very scientific term but its the best ive got on a good solder joint the solder should be smooth and glossy
DIY,not_removed,well that is just something that takes practice ideally you want to have the soldering iron in one hand and the piece of solder in the other you want to make sure you buy the appropriate sized solder they make thin for small joints and thicker solder for fatter wires the part that takes practice is that you have to press the soldering iron down on the wire and you also need to press the solder down on the wire at the same time leave a little space maybe so they arent touching the iron will heat the wire and the wire will melt the solder then youll press the solder into the wire while it is melting until you have good coverage then pull the iron and solder off the wire both at the same time make sure the wire joint doesnt move while solidifying you may need to use a wooden board as a backing board if the wires are too flimsy to press both iron and solder into at once a clamp think potato chip clip or binder clip is useful for holding things in place while working on them i have a board with several different clamps screwed onto it that i use to hold wires in place so they dont shift while working on them dont use a metal board as it will suck the heat away and make it more difficult to solder the joint you dont need a whole lot of solder if your joints look like they have a big blob at the end then you are using too much if you get too much on it then take the tip of the iron and flick the wire and the excess solder will fly off make sure it doesnt hit your arm or leg it stings quite a bit good joint should be shiny and smooth and glossy bad joints have a rough surface example of a good joint
DIY,not_removed,are you gay
DIY,not_removed,it looks glossy but i mostly solder small wires thanks for advice anyway
DIY,not_removed,nice alright ive definitely been using too much solder i have a helping hands station that made life quite a bit easier when i was soldering super tiny joints but nothing was ever as clean as your example thank you
DIY,not_removed,are you asking me out
DIY,not_removed,for tiny joints they make super thin solder that is about the same diameter as the wire in a paperclip
DIY,not_removed,yes but ill be on top
DIY,not_removed,sold
DIY,not_removed,hummm just wanna share my stuffs jeffbarbarecom
DIY,not_removed,use a spray paint called plasti dip when youre ready to take it off it will just peel off
DIY,not_removed,home depot sells one inch thick styrofoam panels that are easy to cut with a razor knife
DIY,not_removed,picture please
DIY,not_removed,i worked in a theater with skylights above the stage really bad design and i saw that they blacked them out with black window lamination plastic cheaper options ive seen is to just paint it with black latex paint but the window lamination is the better choice
DIY,not_removed,if youre renting it needs to be reversible go to the art supply and purchase foam core board in a color you like large enough to cover the opening and overlapping an inch or so it is extremely lite now pickup some double sticky foam tape you could install two strips of aluminum cchannel and some double stick carpet tape just slide the foam core board into the cchannel like a drawer in this way it becomes a feature and is reversible perhaps even ok with the landlord
DIY,not_removed,stuff an open umbrella into the orifice
DIY,not_removed,the cheapest effective solution is aluminum foil
DIY,not_removed,put an umbrella in the space
DIY,not_removed,this simple cheap reversible
DIY,not_removed,seriously
DIY,not_removed,here is some terrible advice cut the ground prong off of the extension cord the ground and the neutral go to the same place be advised this is terrible advice but is is a solution

DIY,not_removed,rdiwhy rjustneckbeardthings
DIY,not_removed,i thought it rather ugly then realised for some reason you posted the before picture first so thats all that shows up on reddit until you click through it was definitely worth the effort to change that fireplace
DIY,not_removed,on the bottom throw a quarter round piece of trim to hide the floormarble transition just did this on a recent renovation and hides any imperfect edges good job
DIY,not_removed,looks great nice job if i could add a thought without being that guy i teach woodshop and push safety on my students that said im not always using tools as intended one thing that was an eye opener for me was when i was using a similar table saw to yours portable job saw in a similar fashion on the ground lost my balance while cutting and dang near put a hand into the blade ever since i put that saw up on a work bench or portable work table that way im not a classic maimed shop teacher just a thought
DIY,not_removed,much nicer than stock but it still looks like its floating i think it needs a hearth
DIY,not_removed,as a married man i hate to hear how hard can it be i saw it on pinterest looks good though man
DIY,not_removed,i just want to say that whoever decided to put that art above the fireplace deserves a good pat on the back adds a really nice layer of depth to what appears to be a really bland and tall wall
DIY,not_removed,i think your dad may have been razing you about the mistakes hes created and had to live with
DIY,not_removed,pintrest making guys work harder since
DIY,not_removed,one tip on cutting the soft stone if you ever do that again i dont know if you cut yours facedown or faceup but i found that when i cut it facedown with the mesh backing facing up i got less fragmenting chipping of the face of the stone as im sure you found also a good blade going very slow are also key
DIY,not_removed,so it looks great but you already know that i really just wanted to say that your a great dad and you should be proud as someone that lost his dad when i was a kid nothing melts my heart than seeing stuff like this i always like to compliment parents when they do stuff like this even if its just considered normal to other people you deserve some credit
DIY,not_removed,
DIY,not_removed,this looks fantastic well done other people who have posted are nitpicking not that the suggestions are bad just wanted to say it looks lovely and id be very pleased if my husband did this to our fireplace
DIY,not_removed,very nicely done congrats
DIY,not_removed,amazing job also i love the picture you have above the fire place mind sharing where you got it
DIY,not_removed,looks great nice work really makes the fireplace stand out loved that you included the music you were listening too checking out trampled by turtles right now
DIY,not_removed,putting drywall directly over a gas fireplace is extremely ill advised its flammable i install gas fireplaces for a living
DIY,not_removed,my before looks nearly identical going to have to do some research
DIY,not_removed,note i know its polite to share the finished project picture first but i like the suspense you can always scroll to the bottom youre a monster
DIY,not_removed,great job mate that came out really well
DIY,not_removed,i think you did a great job but if i may say so i think a darker color on the trim would make it stand out more
DIY,not_removed,i have a similar vintage makita table saw it is easily twice the saw of anything sold today the inside gear and such is all metal and the motor is a beast makita does not sell anything like it today yours is the only other one i have seen
DIY,not_removed,i have zero to no interest in woodworking but i scrolled through and read everything because youre interesting looks good man
DIY,not_removed,nice you went from flat dull to tastefully understated in just steps
DIY,not_removed,where are the pallets
DIY,not_removed,like a glove boy if thats your definition of tight 😂
DIY,not_removed,upvote for me first and the gimme gimmes in the soundtrack also good job
DIY,not_removed,finished product first or nobody cares
DIY,not_removed,this is really well done but diy inspire others when you get to see the before and after right next to each other preferably at the beginning
DIY,not_removed,alright reddit how many codes did op break this time
DIY,not_removed,how are the regulations regarding the distance to combustible materials like wood over here in norway it has to be about away from anything wood etc iirc
DIY,not_removed,thanks for making my imaginary wife think im totally inadequate
DIY,not_removed,looks great to me one major question though why poplar if you were just going to paint over it it is a good look i just dont understand that part of the decision and didnt see the reasoning provided
DIY,not_removed,you can always tell when someone is an amateur painter always do the cutins first then roll them smooth
DIY,not_removed,gaps at the sides would drive me crazy
DIY,not_removed,i love your dads advice just finished my own diy project and needed to hear that
DIY,not_removed,nice work op not sure it really makes any more of a statement but it is nice
DIY,not_removed,that was pretty tame in terms of pintrest inspiration i was expecting mason jars chalk paint and some pallets
DIY,not_removed,fantastic work lots of fun to read as well kudos to you
DIY,not_removed,looks great ive worked on my own fireplace and its a ton of work for us diyers love the explanations
DIY,not_removed,for your mistake i think youd like this song i felt it was appropriate for your work youre fireplace also looks great
DIY,not_removed,for a split second i thought that first image of a kid was an adult and i thought the fireplace was absolutely massive nice work i have fond memories of helping my parents rebuild our house after it burned when i was so its always nice to see kids getting to be part of the proces
DIY,not_removed,nice taste in music man and good work with the fireplace
DIY,not_removed,it is way too much work
DIY,not_removed,hate to be the spelling police but you mean mantel a mantle is a garment like a cloak
DIY,not_removed,great post lovely fireplace and great craftsmanship couple of things to note im a chimney inspector in michigan not sure where you are located but for michigan at least you are actually at a greater risk for a fire with this new set up typically you need an inch of space per of the firebox from combustibles on either side looks like you have about inches and a decent sized firebox also youre required to have a hearth extension made of noncombustible material typically depending on size of firebox as well beautiful work just feel around the fireplace while burning obviously you wouldnt tear up the floor to fix these things just something to help keep a safe fire
DIY,not_removed,nice i was pumped to scroll down and see that very traditional mantle im always a little worried by things that are pinterest inspired personally i hate the subway tile trend but to each their own
DIY,not_removed,i redid my ugly fireplace surround last year and can relate to this post its a million times better now and you should be proud
DIY,not_removed,practice makes perfect
DIY,not_removed,i actually didnt mind the first one as just a plain fireplace but damn you seriously improved it great job
DIY,not_removed,hot guy
DIY,not_removed,if its surrounding a fireplace its mantel
DIY,not_removed,i think its gorgeous nicely done i would add some cool ironwork pieces in the front and youre done
DIY,not_removed,yikes
DIY,not_removed,no words inflict greater fear in the hearts of husbands than wifes pintrest inspired it really doesnt matter what follows the husband will have some sort of illogical and frustrating job ahead my latest pintrest inspired ordeal was sawing tires in half with a sawzall i wrecked quite a few blades doing it
DIY,not_removed,uh oh its on the front page what did op do wrong edit nothing absolutely nothing wrong with this project well done op your new fireplace looks fantastic
DIY,not_removed,how is this pinterest inspired or is it just someone posted an example of a fireplace on pinterest
DIY,not_removed,nice work go jays
DIY,not_removed,i hate to be that guy but in my opinion it looks just as boring as before no personality
DIY,not_removed,nice job i dont like the tile you started with and i dont like the tile you used but great job none the less i wish i had skills like yours
DIY,not_removed,a husband
DIY,not_removed,just dont hang a tv on it
DIY,not_removed,as a happily married relatively handy man i would just like to take this opportunity to say fuck pinterest with all my being fuck pinterest
DIY,not_removed,music my own cursing and this old house clip playing over and over idk why but that had me laughing great job
DIY,not_removed,before i started i spoke with my dad who was a general contractor his whole life wait is op the kid in the picture i decided to bring my son with me oh
DIY,not_removed,go jays
DIY,not_removed,go back to pinterest
DIY,not_removed,wife probably took all the credit
DIY,not_removed,looked better before
DIY,not_removed,finished product doesnt look clean and has a weird float to it and is very plain
DIY,not_removed,thats a lot of work for a fake gaslit fireplace
DIY,not_removed,great work
DIY,not_removed,this is beautiful
DIY,not_removed,i like it i would just recommend a shelf
DIY,not_removed,looks good but i definitely agree with those that say it should have gone right to the wall oh and that picture above it is so cool
DIY,not_removed,looks great op good job sorry if youve already covered but about what was your final costs for materials
DIY,not_removed,great job
DIY,not_removed,looks like my living room pinterest confirmed
DIY,not_removed,hey we have that saw too its a beast
DIY,not_removed,looks amazing can mix your own thinset so much cheaper
DIY,not_removed,that looks amazing
DIY,not_removed,looks great but in the final photo something isnt straight either the picture hanging over the mantle or the mantle itself its all i can see and its driving me crazy
DIY,not_removed,i see some white paint around the edges youll have to repaint your walls now pinterest might have some good suggestions for you the cycle continues
DIY,not_removed,isnt crown fun to cut turned out nice good job
DIY,not_removed,does the existing wall trim go behind the new fireplace surround seems weird to not cut it out
DIY,not_removed,i like it
DIY,not_removed,pretty sure my family saw the exact same pinterest pin because we did this exact thing to ours it looks good
DIY,not_removed,do ya watch nl you shouting like a glove makes me suspicious also stellar job
DIY,not_removed,i am surprised no one has said that he still has paint smudges on the walls still looks awesome far better work than i would do
DIY,not_removed,damn could have done all that with out removing the tile either way it looks amazing
DIY,not_removed,i can tell you this because for years ive lived with it is he calling you an imperfection
DIY,not_removed,not enough mansion jars or twine s
DIY,not_removed,wow really nice job
DIY,not_removed,put some quarter round down there at the base as a cover up in case it hasnt been suggested already
DIY,not_removed,good job just one little suggestion if you replace your baseboard with the same stuff you used on the fireplace itll tie the whole room together with it
DIY,not_removed,real good work i noticed you skipped caulking though i recommend always caulking after priming any and all gaps those gaps where the mantle meets the walls needs caulk badly
DIY,not_removed,bravo
DIY,not_removed,the pic above the fireplace also looks great
DIY,not_removed,well done reminds me of growing up helping my dad work on our cabin and your music choices were spot on for the longest time i felt like i was the only jurrassic fan
DIY,not_removed,i love that the clamps still have the tags on them i can only assume you plan on returning them my man
DIY,not_removed,great job
DIY,not_removed,looks damn good great job
DIY,not_removed,that looks awesome
DIY,not_removed,when taking off tile remove all the sheetrock then re sheetrock its quicker
DIY,not_removed,good job puttin the kid to work
DIY,not_removed,hey nice job a bit off topic but did you do the tiles in the backfront yard there in pic looks really nice
DIY,not_removed,good job op it looks really good
DIY,not_removed,great job looks good
DIY,not_removed,and if you want it to burn for more than seconds you have to log in or sign up for an account looks great though
DIY,not_removed,crap dude thats some serious good work nice write up
DIY,not_removed,great job it looks wonderful
DIY,not_removed,they dont have a fire code there that makes you put at least of non flammable material in front of it
DIY,not_removed,no tv over the fireplace im impressed
DIY,not_removed,regarding demo besides plastic tarps those rubber kids foam play squares work wonder for protecting floors additionally when removing tile knowing the drywall will most likely be screwed we usually just cut the tile drywall off with a rotozip or oscillating saw quicker neater then just replace drywall but a very nice job overall
DIY,not_removed,thats really lovely lucky wife
DIY,not_removed,a little dap will smooth out those gaps in the corners my friend
DIY,not_removed,great work its gorgeous
DIY,not_removed,dont mean to be picky but the finished product it looks very slightly offset as if the width measurement on the right side of the actual fireplace is shorter than the width of the tile on the left side
DIY,not_removed,theres a jig you can buy for and make perfect crown molding cuts
DIY,not_removed,awesome work poplar sure painted up well i saw the first one first and thought that was the finished product was trying to figure out what to say hehe really awesome work did you use an additive in your paint to keep it smooth
DIY,not_removed,you stayed incredibly clean i would look like i was made of sawdust if i tried this project
DIY,not_removed,good job but being a pinterest project i expected at least mason jars or giant jar
DIY,not_removed,very nice work
DIY,not_removed,can you tell us the exact paint and primer used
DIY,not_removed,a little photoshop on those overpaint marks on the awll please
DIY,not_removed,do you not find great annoyance in that the wall skirting and the mantle skirting butt together instead of overlapping id be irked a lot if that were mine
DIY,not_removed,sweet
DIY,not_removed,i tell my wife all the time that when i paint a room i dont see color i only see paint on a wall with little imperfections every where she tells me im nuts
DIY,not_removed,that looks awesome
DIY,not_removed,great work well done
DIY,not_removed,whats pintrest inspired
DIY,not_removed,i wouldve probably been the laziest person ever and just tile that sectioned wall to the top as a feature wall no woodworking involved really nice tiles by the way
DIY,not_removed,what madness compelled the previous person to throw in half tiles near the corners good job changing it op
DIY,not_removed,love this really clever
DIY,not_removed,it looks much better but no one should be allowed to post a picture of a fireplace without fire the album needs a shot with low level lighting and a fire flickering inside
DIY,not_removed,i saw this and thought thats not my old house that i sold is it
DIY,not_removed,i have no clue it was bad
DIY,not_removed,beautiful like model good looks with a scientist brain
DIY,not_removed,yeah i know i worked at a lumber yard in high school and this always baffled me but as long as everything is consistent and everybody still wants to call it a then all is well in the world
DIY,not_removed,are you in colorado looks like my neighborhood
DIY,not_removed,nice woodworking skills in other news time to try to keep my wife off of pinterest
DIY,not_removed,damn if i were to ever get married again id totally want a so like this what my wife wants my wife gets
DIY,not_removed,as info that would make projects like this even easier looks muuuuuch better than the typical electric fp and the fact that it only needs electricity no gas line or chimney pipe makes install easier disclosure i work for a dimplex distributor
DIY,not_removed,awesome work
DIY,not_removed,looks great and very professional grade if you are planning on doing more trim like this you should look into getting a kreg jig even a simple cheap one would have been a lifesaver for you on that top shelf instead of the dowels also your playlist made me wanna go listen to some saw them in with ceelo the roots lauryn hill and outkast best fucking concert ever
DIY,not_removed,are there guidelines for gas fireplaces like wood ones for how far away combustable manteltrim parts must be
DIY,not_removed,awesome work how long did it take you take to complete
DIY,not_removed,great job op i love the mosaic tile surrounded by the painted wood dont show this to my wife or ill be making one too one thought table saws are no joke please try and put it on a stand so youre not running boards through at an awkward angleheight picture you dont really want to be bending over like that
DIY,not_removed,lol wife found something on pinterest and made you make it
DIY,not_removed,for years i lived with it not talking about you is he op awesome job btw good stuff
DIY,not_removed,im in the midst of a similar project in my case im replacing tile with polished slate ostrich grey but after demo realized my insert isnt level however its parallel to the floor and mantle been trying to decide if i just install the stone level or just parallel to everything else also did you use cement backer board and did you build a support for the tile over the insert trying to determine if this is necessary or not fwiw in my locality and many us building codes i cant have an insert without a hearth made from nonflammable material at least surrounding the front on the floor not sure what your floor is made of but looks like laminate or vinyl plank which isnt nonflammable
DIY,not_removed,to each his own i love what you did i also do pinterest projects for myself and the wife ive done probably or so i have lots of woodworking tools and such so i like to put them to use keep up the great work fyi your dad is right no one ever sees the mistakes that you think stand out
DIY,not_removed,the final pic so you dont have to scroll
DIY,not_removed,that looks an awful lot like uh lowlands farm co and the nearest lowes being the only place nearby that you can get poplar work looks great any concern about heat warping
DIY,not_removed,i saw trampled by turtles live when they opened for lord huron was not terribly impressed to be honest however a big part of it was that their sound engineer knew fuck all about balance i might have liked them a little more if the sound was better overall it was just loud and muddled
DIY,not_removed,i know this is gonna get buried but i personally love the diy posts that start with the before photo and make you wait till the end to see the beautiful finished product
DIY,not_removed,am i the only on on reddit that wonders how the wife looks
DIY,not_removed,i dont think it looks much better to be honest
DIY,not_removed,great job looks awesome and even better that you did it yourself no doubt the wife will love it
DIY,not_removed,is no one going to mention the piece of tape he left on
DIY,not_removed,where do guys like this come from lol i cant even get a guy to take me out to dinner thats not a freaking diner d
DIY,not_removed,awesome job have an upvote for the santa save
DIY,not_removed,nicely done op your music selections were a welcome addition what is your im done celebration jam
DIY,not_removed,wow that looks so much better at the end thanks for the moment of panic at the beginning of the slide show
DIY,not_removed,can we see a picture w the fire running
DIY,not_removed,wow that looks amazing im sure your wife is elated
DIY,not_removed,looks great tile contractor here my only suggestion if youre cutting brittle or crystalline stone in the future or cheaper material if you run a strip of painters tape over the section that youre going to be cutting on the saw youll usually end up with a far cleaner cut edge with that trick ive even managed to dry cut glass very brittle marble tile with an angle grinder and a nice diamond blade when the wet saw shit the bed in the last leg of job
DIY,not_removed,nice job i do most of my home projects to me first and the gimme gimmes such a fun band it doesnt happen often but if you ever get to see them live do it
DIY,not_removed,you had me at me first and the gimme gimmes oh and the projects alright too d
DIY,not_removed,scrolled to bottom immediately normally would have looked at the process but now no
DIY,not_removed,i dont think the problem is the mantlethe problem is the ugly fake fireplace
DIY,not_removed,jim croce the darkness and lil dicky i applaud you good sir oh yeah the fireplace looks good too
DIY,not_removed,the picture of your son with the lumber would get my vote on this weeks rpicturechallenge leading lines
DIY,not_removed,good luck on your next triathlon
DIY,not_removed,haha i thought the pic was the finished upgrade nicely done btw im the that notices nothing wrong with any of it
DIY,not_removed,dude beautiful project music choices perfect
DIY,not_removed,the whole mistake thing your dad told you is soooo true every project i did all the super tiny little imperfections would pop out to me and my dad would say pretty much the same thing a good rule if your wife approves you did good
DIY,not_removed,shout out to a fellow triathlete great work noticed the you were wearing
DIY,not_removed,cut the floor out in front of it and add ceramic otherwise this upgrade was pointless mantle is ok though good work bad design
DIY,not_removed,ffs op
DIY,not_removed,isnt code minimum wood trim clearance from opening might want to check that
DIY,not_removed,came for the diy stayed to say go jays
DIY,not_removed,the roots lil dicky trampled by turtles your music is on point man as is your new fireplace im excited for you to listen to those tunes next to a nice fire i will live vicariously through you
DIY,not_removed,great album love that you included the music you were listening to throughout the process such an important factor in projects like these nice work
DIY,not_removed,just wanted to let you know you just made my night seeing this props to you for actually being a decent husband and dad and spending time with your kids working on something for your wife im a female college student who kinda believes love doesnt exist and real husbandsdads are a myth so this was awesome to see tonight keep being a great person
DIY,not_removed,do you have a brother and is he single
DIY,not_removed,like a glove a glove with lots of gaps and things not lining up
DIY,not_removed,mods really should just delete posts that dont start with the finished product
DIY,not_removed,is this the type of thing a husband has to do to get laid
DIY,not_removed,it looked better before why do women always have to create a chore
DIY,not_removed,awesome read and really well done also can this become a thing now on diy where people list what they listen to when they work lol
DIY,not_removed,the commentary gave me aids but overall great work srs
DIY,not_removed,i am more interested in your patio than the fireplace can you post shots of that is that stamped concrete
DIY,not_removed,good work also wife sees it on pinterest you pretty much get it done wife does finishing touches i feel it
DIY,not_removed,is it just me or is the wall paint damaged in the last photo if so i assume op is just gunna grab a quart of color matched paint to touch up sometime soon
DIY,not_removed,dont tell me what to do
DIY,not_removed,beautiful job op the wifey must be proud
DIY,not_removed,can it hold a tv
DIY,not_removed,nice i was painting doors today listening to trampled by turtles
DIY,not_removed,i would like to guess which city you reside montrose great job with your project
DIY,not_removed,upvote for trampled by turtles also nice work op
DIY,not_removed,there is not enough porn in this picture for this to be pintrist inspired
DIY,not_removed,great job i would have gone with a different tile too light with the white if you ask me
DIY,not_removed,it looks really nice are you sure about leaving wood beams and electrical cable inside the constriction in which the fire place is built in picture or
DIY,not_removed,on the quarter round at the base to hide the edge quick and easy
DIY,not_removed,what brand of watch is that
DIY,not_removed,congrats very nice workmanship i admire your attention and dedication to little details as for the aesthetics to each their own i cant say i like much the white on white im more partial to stronger hues but its your or rather the wifes id guess choice to make my take out i really really need to get a table saw btw by cutting a in half you dont get a this system the lumber industry swears by is really annoying like shit so a is actually while a is
DIY,not_removed,i love how your daughter is there watching theres nothing more that makes a dad feel cool than when his kids being impressed with him working while mom is just youre not done yet the kids make you feel like your tim the toolman
DIY,not_removed,good job op i came to compliment you on your musical taste i love jurassic and havent really met anyone else that likes them as much as i do
DIY,not_removed,this style of back splash along with small white tiled kitchens is so over done every one knows that you buy this crap by the sheet from home depot why would you want it in your living room
DIY,not_removed,had to load more pictures to see result didnt look thanks for the share anyway
DIY,not_removed,looks great nice to see you were able to have your son help out
DIY,not_removed,post the end result first
DIY,not_removed,great job i also prefer to see the finished product at the end
DIY,not_removed,like a glove
DIY,not_removed,its a bit boring especially given the palette of the surroundings
DIY,not_removed,final product first otherwise great job
DIY,not_removed,i like it your wife looks about
DIY,not_removed,nice job but youre an enabler woman looks at pinterest for minutes man works all weekend
DIY,not_removed,nice thanks for the reply
DIY,not_removed,do you get your own is it gonna be cooler
DIY,not_removed,couldnt see the finished product op my internet is slow and imgur isnt helping on mobile your fireplace must be awesome im just sad that i cant see it
DIY,not_removed,another example of a woman wanting something that requires shop skills and having a man do it i thought they wanted equality s
DIY,not_removed,the question is does the tv stay on top
DIY,not_removed,pro tip when you buy a home suggest to the wife that you hang a few pictures accidently miss the nails and make a few holes in the drywall to be covered by the pictures suddenly youll have many more free weekends or make her happy whatever
DIY,not_removed,nice calves
DIY,not_removed,please put the finished picture first geez i never got the finished product
DIY,not_removed,gas fireplace fake as a cake
DIY,not_removed,can you share details of the tile who makes it where did you get it looks great and very much what i have in mind for my fireplace i was thinking marble ledgestone nice job
DIY,not_removed,i really want to downvote you for not putting the finished product first but i cant do it as you seem nice and did a good job
DIY,not_removed,but the wife wants she gets and i just say yes dear wow tell your wife she is a lucky woman the finished product looks great but what made me even happier is the way you included shots of your kids and the attitude with which you respect your wifes wishes if my thenhusband now exhusband took this attitude maybe we would have stayed married instead our kids are being raised in two separate households and boy does it suck for both me and them you sound like a good husband
DIY,not_removed,i see those shoddy miter cuts that you tried to sand the piss out of to fix tsk tsk
DIY,not_removed,just an fyi anybody who does this kind of work either professionally or just around the house will judge your imperfections i never noticed this kind of stuff until i bought a home and started doing my own projects now i see how much i can spot in other peoples homes i cant believe what some people let contractors slide on im cool with a few imperfect spots if i did the work but fuck if thats going to slide if im paying someone else to do it
DIY,not_removed,boner
DIY,not_removed,my first thought after seeing the finished product was this dude is getting laid tonight and then happened to notice about a half a dozen kids in your photos clearly no problems in that area i need to up my wifing a bit maybe ill get a sick fireplace too
DIY,not_removed,i thought the exact same thing and then said hot damn
DIY,not_removed,what was wrong with the fireplace before
DIY,not_removed,yeah thats my bad i knew it was custom to show the finished product first but decided i wanted to torture all you diyers and make your thumbs hurt by scrolling
DIY,not_removed,glad i came to the comments
DIY,not_removed,the before picture was nicer obviously lack of mantle but the fireplace itself was nicer
DIY,not_removed,me too i hated the way the tiles were layed out across the top then realized that was the original nice job op it looks great
DIY,not_removed,i didnt even bother
DIY,not_removed,yeah holy shit i was about to be like ironicpinterestsuccess although honestly im not a fan of having the mouth of the fireplace surrounded by a different substance than the shaft that goes up i realize the mantle breaks up the visual element but having the part above the mantle be painted sheetrock while the area below is tile gives this sense of my fireplace is surrounded by flammable materials and then i stuck on some tile to suggest otherwise just a personal aesthetic choice though i grew up with a fireplace that was brick all the way to the ceiling and the chute out of the roof was the same brick and the house was the same brick so it just looked substantial and safe so that could be coloring my perception of this breaking it up like that also makes the fireplace look squatty if you continued the same material all the way to the ceiling it would look tall kind of like how a short person shouldnt sag his pants because it will make him look shorter wearing the waist higher will create an optical illusion whereby you look taller with longer legs that of course assumes the goal you want is to have a fireplace look tall obviously the workmanship is there in this project though so my hat is off to op for doing a bang up job
DIY,not_removed,exactly what i was thinking ez perfect solution
DIY,not_removed,a shoe molding would be better maybe thats what its for but yes thatll finish it off nicely and actually belongs
DIY,not_removed,previous owners did that to hide that they didnt pull up the baseboards to get the flooring edge right so we have baseboards that are brown and quarter round that is whitegoing to a brown floor blah i cant wait to rip it up
DIY,not_removed,trim heals all shitty cuts
DIY,not_removed,whats a qtr round
DIY,not_removed,or else he could use a grey caulk and tape off the stone for a crisp line i find that works well too
DIY,not_removed,oh god please not quarter round do some real molding instead having floored myself when i see qr i usually go someone fucked up its almost always because the person left the baseboards added a floor left the expansion gap and then added qr onto the alreadyinstalled baseboards to hide the expansion gap rather than removing bb installing floor and then reinstalling the bb about a quarter inch higher covering the expansion gap so maybe qr isnt so bad for most people but so many cheap ass floor guys leave the bb and use qr to hide the fact that they did this it drives me nuts once youve installed a few floors you see this everywhere and its maddening even in my first house the downstairs had tile when we moved in it was done this way the upstairs i did myself and removed the bb and reinstalled above the floor seeing as how op doesnt have qr anywhere else around there he absolutely should not use qr he should use the same type of molding that is there already
DIY,not_removed,nothing like almost dismemberment to teach a life lesson thanks for the tip ill do it next time
DIY,not_removed,yea but the classic maimed shop teacher scares the kids into safety like the best
DIY,not_removed,neat tool ive seen on jobsites is to cut a hole through a sheet of plywood that mounts the saw flush sit the plywood on sawhorses and bam useful table saw for large pieces
DIY,not_removed,had a classic maimed woodshop teacher in high school he told us the story he lost three fingers on one hand in the car accident that killed his wife was not a shop accident
DIY,not_removed,you could tell your students you lost your hand in a woodcutting accident but
DIY,not_removed,my earth science teacher in junior high had a missing finger he used to be the wood shop teacher
DIY,not_removed,well i really debated going all the way but wanted the top shelf to stick out on all sides so that was my solution my wife pointed it out too oh well
DIY,not_removed,same here im looking at it and thinking nice job although those spaces on the sides those would drive me nuts plus cleaning nope theyre spider crevices now add the hearth fun to decorate
DIY,not_removed,why did you have to do this to me my wife read this and said oh that would look nice
DIY,not_removed,i second this maybe a darker tile
DIY,not_removed,i agree with this it would look incredible with a hearth
DIY,not_removed,my mom got obsessed with pintrest style pallet stuff a few years back my dad got so sick of hearing it looks so easy
DIY,not_removed,as a florist that statement is my nightmare especially when they dont know how much its going to cost them
DIY,not_removed,i have started having my wife help me do these projects she appreciates the work that goes into diy projects way more now its a fun bonding experience and im teaching her a skill that shes always been interested in but never had anyone to teach her
DIY,not_removed,my wife has an entire hunnydo list on pintrest for me
DIY,not_removed,my answer to this pinterest statement has become youre right you figure out the plans and ill build it ive yet to do a pinterest project
DIY,not_removed,ill tell my wife for you she says thanks
DIY,not_removed,i am pretty sure that picture is from ikea just thought id mention in case you have a place for it
DIY,not_removed,oh shit damn thats deep
DIY,not_removed,razzing razing is what raiders would do when they burned enemy villages to the ground and salted the fields so crops wouldnt grow
DIY,not_removed,this doesnt have enough stencils to be from pinterest
DIY,not_removed,damn where were you days ago
DIY,not_removed,thanks so much i try to involve them as much as i can they are awesome little kids
DIY,not_removed,looks great im hesitant to show my wife because she wants something similar done as a winter project also please straighten the picture
DIY,not_removed,thank you i truly appreciate reddit positive people
DIY,not_removed,ikea
DIY,not_removed,and
DIY,not_removed,trampled by turtles are so good ive seen them a few times in concert great performers
DIY,not_removed,you should probably tell that to every builder everywhere
DIY,not_removed,as you know each fireplace has different clearances to combustible material this heatilator is just a builder model pos no offense op id bet that this isnt heater rated and that the clearances for this particular unit allow it
DIY,not_removed,after helping my brother redo his fireplace this past summer i just found out that they make a drywallsheetrock specifically for fireplaces i would be more worried about that wood
DIY,not_removed,haha thats awesome i love old tools unless its a skilsaw that somebody cut through the cord once and then repaired the cord and sometimes it sparks yeah i have one of those too
DIY,not_removed,its different for gas fireplaces vs wood burning
DIY,not_removed,building inspector here clearances to combustibles can vary for gas fireplaces for a wood burning fireplace this size the irc requires a hearth and to sides for a gas burning appliance you refer to the manufacturers specifications this looks pretty typical to me
DIY,not_removed,because it doesnt warp like pine over time at least thats according my dad
DIY,not_removed,you too dude helping one ugly fireplace at a time we are ready for sainthood
DIY,not_removed,thanks ill tell my son you said so
DIY,not_removed,show me what you mean
DIY,not_removed,i wonder if an angle grinder would have worked better for that ive never tried to cut a tire before though so i cant really say
DIY,not_removed,truth my wife found her fireplace idea on pinterest also it involved a lot more work than i had the time or skill to complete
DIY,not_removed,my thoughts exactly oh shit what did i mess up
DIY,not_removed,my wife saw something like this on pinterest realized ours was shoddy and was inspired to tell me about it and show me what she wanted edit run and hide quick the spelling nazi found you
DIY,not_removed,my favorite reddit statements always start with i hate to be that guy but thanks for your opinion
DIY,not_removed,meta
DIY,not_removed,i bet it has a ton of old racist war stories like my grandpa
DIY,not_removed,are you married if so you would understand the unique power that your wife has over you and when she says she wants something you do it and if you dont your probably divorced
DIY,not_removed,what
DIY,not_removed,thanks dude reddit is awesome
DIY,not_removed,all in all was about this was with a few new saw blades and other things that were a little pricy
DIY,not_removed,i ripped it off
DIY,not_removed,im only but maybe not sure ill get back to you
DIY,not_removed,i did just forgot to mention it
DIY,not_removed,me too one time a friend of mine said he hated rap groups then proceeded to play wutang in his car the fuk
DIY,not_removed,tools used to have a lot of metal and often zero plastic now if you get five years out of one youre luck unless you buy the expensive stuff im talking craftsman lowerend delta and stuff at home depot or lowes quality is deff still available but it costs
DIY,not_removed,you know it im so glad somebody noticed this haha
DIY,not_removed,thanks its actually stained and stamped concrete i found a crew of dudes who worked off the books after hours and did this for cash and a case of modelo beer awesome stuff
DIY,not_removed,you are right i didnt realize the wall was actually off and the fireplace wasnt centered till it was too late but its only but good eye
DIY,not_removed,no just used an expensive and nice paint and primed it first
DIY,not_removed,i reallife photoshopped them and just painted them
DIY,not_removed,im waiting to let everything really dry and set before i apply heat maybe a week from now i just got too excited and had to post asap
DIY,not_removed,maybe we did just buy it and move across the street
DIY,not_removed,yes noco
DIY,not_removed,ive never heard of a kreg jig but i just googled it and what a great tool amazon prime has me hooked up also what an epic concert that must have been
DIY,not_removed,if i gave it an hourly id say man hours give or take a few this also includes shopping and driving to lowes times
DIY,not_removed,somebody else said the same thing good call i should also be wearing safety glasses
DIY,not_removed,actually the floor is engineered wood so yes flammable but the gas fireplace is encased so there is no worry or code for fire materials around it it puts out very little heat as well actually it kind of sucks but zero of these types of fireplaces in colorado have a hearth anymore on another note hardibacker is a great material but typically only used when there will be moisture around or near it again you may not be able to use drywall around your if its a real fire place or code insists not sure about the level part thats a tough call
DIY,not_removed,not until you mentioned it hmm
DIY,not_removed,thanks i did that on purpose as i agree make them dig for it
DIY,not_removed,most if not all direct vent fireplaces have no hearth requirement the whole point of a noncombustible hearth is in case sparksembers from a wood fire were to pop out not sure of the exact model of this unit but id be willing to bet it has no hearth requirement
DIY,not_removed,thanks for your honesty id rather disagree than have you be a liar
DIY,not_removed,all my neighbors are from chicago so yes
DIY,not_removed,ah shit where
DIY,not_removed,a ferris buller rendition of twist and shout dance moves and all
DIY,not_removed,i am waiting a week to turn on the heat so the mortar has time to set
DIY,not_removed,this post right here is gold thanks for sharing next time this will make me seem so much smarter
DIY,not_removed,heck yes when and where maybe a bar mitzvah
DIY,not_removed,what does that mean ive never seen this
DIY,not_removed,also it looks really sharp nice job
DIY,not_removed,thanks so much
DIY,not_removed,thanks i just love music there are so many good types and sounds out there
DIY,not_removed,what if i told you you could be a good real loving husband and father without being a handyman
DIY,not_removed,go read wild at heart by john eldridge
DIY,not_removed,actually yeah
DIY,not_removed,damn right they should lets start a riot where are the pitchforks ahrggg
DIY,not_removed,id like to think so because we all listen to music when we work so why not
DIY,not_removed,yeah found a crew that would do stamped concrete for the modelo special that means cash under the table and a case of modelo beer cost me about stamped and stained
DIY,not_removed,i got too excited and took an after pic before i touched up the paint its fixed now
DIY,not_removed,nope more north
DIY,not_removed,garmin its a triathlonmultisport watch
DIY,not_removed,how did you know what my kitchen looked like
DIY,not_removed,haha this is good stuff now that im married the only thing thats mine is my bicycle
DIY,not_removed,that black cabinet next to the mantle has a tv that goes up and down inside of it my wife says she doesnt like to decorate with tvs
DIY,not_removed,thank you ironman triathlons will change your calves forever
DIY,not_removed,heck yes everybody has their own skills and likes if you are doing what you love then keep doing it you wont be good at it unless you are loving it
DIY,not_removed,thanks so much i appreciate the positivity
DIY,not_removed,my wife told me if i did the backsplash this weekend i could blow on the gapxgq collection when it was released worked for her
DIY,not_removed,see im the other way if i paid someone to do work and there was a imperfection id just chaulk it up to that bastard contractor but something ive done every time i look at the work it bugs me
DIY,not_removed,
DIY,not_removed,thats what i said when i saw his calves
DIY,not_removed,httpsyoutubevrmqexixwss
DIY,not_removed,there was no hearth there is still no hearth
DIY,not_removed,the tiling bugs me irregular sized tiles and the use of single large tiles makes it feel institutional in an unappealing kind of way its simple and presumably efficient to put together but not terribly elegant
DIY,not_removed,haha ya when i first opened as well i was thinking wtf this guy put tape on his wall and got all this karma but finished product looks good also go jays go brantford here
DIY,not_removed,jokes on you i scroll with my pinky
DIY,not_removed,i didnt get to see it i assumed it would have just or so pictures but after scrolling to the bottom on mobile and seeing load more images i closed it if i do that times out of my reddit app crashes i guess from having too much in memory so the downside is that much less people actually probably saw the finished product either from laziness or technical hurdles like mine
DIY,not_removed,eh i ignored everything until i saw the final photo
DIY,not_removed,i prefer the before first 👍
DIY,not_removed,much appreciated two mangled thumbs up
DIY,not_removed,if you can get the plasticyfoam kind this is a good use for that stuff you an just glue it down and not risk a nail going askew and hittingcracking that tile
DIY,not_removed,whats the difference between shoe molsing and quarter round i thought they were the same thing
DIY,not_removed,if op wants to hide the wood floor chip as well he might have to use quarter round as the shoe molding might not be wide enough to cover the splint
DIY,not_removed,yes yes yes yes yes yes quarter round is far too heavy and ugly shoe moulding is what you want everybody please stop using quarter round its goddamn ugly as fucking hell
DIY,not_removed,thats brutal you can at least get a matching quarter round to replace it with or a shoe mould which i think looks way better unless youre planning to redo the floors
DIY,not_removed,its a piece of wood trim that has a cross section of a quarter circle
DIY,not_removed,a lil ol halfroundarino
DIY,not_removed,dowel rod cut in half is a half round cut into a fourth would be a quarter round
DIY,not_removed,quarter round piece of trim httpwwwuptownfloorscomimagesquarterroundmiteredseamjpg its missing the part in the middle so you can clearly see what this does
DIY,not_removed,also at the risk of being that guy please consider upgrading your light switch on the saw to a nvr switch if that light switch accidentally gets flipped on while transporting the saw it could unexpectedly start up when you plug it in the power cord which could result in a nasty accident
DIY,not_removed,lol my husband tells amazing stories of his shop teacher mac who was short a few fingers he was an old new york eyeyon wurkkuh iron worker he used to go to mother fuckin titty city with the boys and some mother fuckers tried to roll me on a test my husband answered a question with rubber mallet the teacher said no its a mothafuckin banger
DIY,not_removed,reminds me of neds survival guide and that old carpenter teacher
DIY,not_removed,ignoring safety made me the man i am todayholds stump up to eye patch
DIY,not_removed,i like it good clean lines and the notgoing all the way to the walls gives it depth and interest looks good no hearth required thumbs up
DIY,not_removed,im the opposite i love it how you did it
DIY,not_removed,looks great except for the stopping short of the existing walls dont listen to this nonsense it looks fabulous as it is
DIY,not_removed,you did this to yourself
DIY,not_removed,i found a really good example of something that would look really nice httpimgurcomaztoxb
DIY,not_removed,dont use quarter round its far to clunky looking use shoe mold which has a narrower profile or since the gap you are covering is so small scribe mold fireplaces usually use a piece of scribe around all the tile its installed after the tile is done and really saves time from all the cuts on the outside border one other thing try a color match caulk for the floorto tile gap a very thin bead might look a lot cleaner than a piece of trim across the front use a water based color caulk to match your floor mask the tile apply caulk and wipe smooth and tight with a damp rag once you remove tape itll look super clean and crack will be gone you can always cover with trim later if you decide that would look better
DIY,not_removed,sorry bro needs a hearth good thing for you it should be easy prep the floor lay it over the wood fill and trim
DIY,not_removed,is this just a decorative fireplace looks really nice
DIY,not_removed,hahahahaha
DIY,not_removed,diy part coming soon
DIY,not_removed,how many times have you been asked to make the
DIY,not_removed,ikea for sure
DIY,not_removed,ahh i kind of like my original comment more now better visuals
DIY,not_removed,its crooked will you fix that please
DIY,not_removed,thanks
DIY,not_removed,so good definitely adding these guys to my normal rotation
DIY,not_removed,i do when i see it
DIY,not_removed,none taken it puts out almost zero heat so pos yes
DIY,not_removed,thats true i dont know heatilator clearances we dont sell them its still ill advised even if it doesnt catch fire its almost definitely going to crack or not what do i know
DIY,not_removed,also it could very well be type x drywall the heat clearances was my first though as well more so the wood that op put on i wouldnt normally care except lately we have been installing a gas fireplace and i was shocked at how restrictive the non combustible material requirements are even for finishing materials
DIY,not_removed,we all have one of those
DIY,not_removed,good to know i made a dining table out of poplar recently but it was mainly because i loved the look of the grain hopefully it has that added benefit as well
DIY,not_removed,well you already have a screen but you could add cool andirons and fireplace set or take out the plain one and add a cool standalone one like below depends on your kid situation
DIY,not_removed,the beads were really hard to cut while the steel threads in the grips of the tire were hard but manageable personally i dont think theres a good way to cut up a tire and thats probably a good thing for durability my wife got what she wanted which was sections of tire to build garden ornaments theyre definitely not my cup of tea but she was happy so theres that

DIY,not_removed,all that matters is that you like it the craftsmanship looks great very professional and im sure it adds value to the home
DIY,not_removed,we were actually in the middle of completely remodeling it i just didnt want to wait till it was put back together to take the picture
DIY,not_removed,thank you for confirming this i thought it was just my perception getting to me great job otherwiseyou took the fireplace from being somewhat cold and not the centerpiece of a room to warm and cozy and definitely the highlight please show us pictures of the first fire going in it
DIY,not_removed,across the street from me was a cow farm so it isnt mine grin that fireplace style must just be standard in modern homes or within a specific builder chain i was never overly fond of that gas fireplace is your propane
DIY,not_removed,i didnt even notice the jays hat until the second time i looked at the photos i agree go jays sad we made an early exit this year
DIY,not_removed,its a fully incased gas fireplace zero flames leave this thing
DIY,not_removed,that blue stripe across the top am i missing something
DIY,not_removed,cool looking forward to seeing it
DIY,not_removed,careful they ruined jonnys
DIY,not_removed,every week there is a challenge people take pictures then they vote on a winner or were you asking what leading lines are leading lines refers to a technique of composition where the viewer of your photos attention is drawn to lines that lead to the main subject of the image
DIY,not_removed,not the point i was making simply saying its so rare for men nowadays to spend time and energy just to make their girl smile at least in my experience they dont have to build a fireplace just cool to see someone put their efforts into something to make someone else happy not something they just buy
DIY,not_removed,rubbish everyone knows men are only good if they can build a fireplace
DIY,not_removed,can confirm did many projects with my dad when i was a kid and he was not pleasant lack of patience and a fiery temper i was used to it though so it was still fun and i learned a lot he wasis truly an asshole though
DIY,not_removed,noted will def check it out
DIY,not_removed,it looks awesome fireplace is nice too but i really like the color
DIY,not_removed,i like your style
DIY,not_removed,i didnt say it doesnt bug me but im way more ok with something being imperfect if i did it than if i paid someone else to do it
DIY,not_removed,the best hot damn to ever hot damn
DIY,not_removed,literally watched this episode with my mom an hour ago watching it again i love how they slowly like humanize andre braugher he is a gift from the heavens
DIY,not_removed,ayyyeee
DIY,not_removed,i dont know i think it has a lot of heart
DIY,not_removed,same i thought it was shite but saw comments and went back that was a close one it looks nice also go jays go next year
DIY,not_removed,well there was a post a while ago where a girl covered her floor in colored tape which was also pinterest inspired
DIY,not_removed,thats so fancy of you do you wear a monocle
DIY,not_removed,middle finger im confused how anyone would scroll with your thumb i am more comfortable with my pinky for sure xd
DIY,not_removed,guy who is not donald trump
DIY,not_removed,yeah my app crashed too ah well guess it was pretty nice
DIY,not_removed,wouldnt the heat from the fireplace warp or shrink that stuff
DIY,not_removed,
DIY,not_removed,quarter round as the name implies is a quarter circle when viewed from an end base shoe is a similar long strip usually about wide x thick with one edge rounded over like a bullnose it looks a bit classier than quarter round and youll usually see it around kitchen cabinetry and such
DIY,not_removed,quarter round is a type of shoe moulding but not all shoe mouldings are quarter round
DIY,not_removed,shoe molding is just smaller nonquartered quarterround often thinner and taller from what ive seen on shelves
DIY,not_removed,doesnt sick out as far quarter round is literally just a degree slice of a cylinder and protrudes way too far from the wall for most base applications
DIY,not_removed,qr is literally one quarter of a round dowel
DIY,not_removed,yup if i had to then thats what id do
DIY,not_removed,agreed
DIY,not_removed,can you provide a picture of what youre talking about i was under the impression shoe molding was just another name for quarter round
DIY,not_removed,yep definitely going to redo the floors within years gotta get that nest egg set first turns out it was white baseboards pine ish color quarter round and similar floor color near pine but maybe a shade darker still though its an eyesore to me as our present colors are creme wallsso cream white pine dark pine it looks like a frigin ice cream cone color scale
DIY,not_removed,ah right
DIY,not_removed,thanks
DIY,not_removed,that looks awesome yeah totally not showing my wife
DIY,not_removed,why is it so big imo its way too big
DIY,not_removed,at this point id just fill in the hole of the fireplace and turn it into a tv mount
DIY,not_removed,its called a gas fireplace
DIY,not_removed,thankfully none its called a composite bouquet heres what the majority of the bouquets look like that ive had to make
DIY,not_removed,done
DIY,not_removed,if its this common it must not be that big of a deal
DIY,not_removed,did you consider replacing the fireplace with a better model while you were at it it would have quadrupled your cost but the problem you have now is youre stuck with it unless you want to rip your hard work down and redo it unless its feasible to remove the unit from the back
DIY,not_removed,more than most its good looking out i was just trying to give some reassurance to the homeowner happy holidays
DIY,not_removed,well that explains the crack in the wall right above the fireplace in the place i just bought any advice on how to do it better when i get to replacing this crappy builders fireplace
DIY,not_removed,especially for finishing materials that convection heat just rolls up the wall even typex is paper backed and doesnt qualify as noncombustible in most cases you gotta use durarock or another cement sheeting material
DIY,not_removed,i have like of them
DIY,not_removed,any pictures to share of the dining table
DIY,not_removed,haha ok cool its natural gas mixture of gases including propane provided by city utilities yeah pretty standard fireplace in most new homes in co it doesnt put out much heat but it looks nice we just use our furnace mostly
DIY,not_removed,yeah that was my point there is no hearth requirement because theres no risk
DIY,not_removed,blue jays sorry mate
DIY,not_removed,go to the bottom picture i put the finale at the finale
DIY,not_removed,its also not forced which is lovely considering how forced most tv shows are about character development
DIY,not_removed,oh you but seriously inserts without any flooring bug me
DIY,not_removed,touché my good man
DIY,not_removed,here i was thinking i was alone until i clicked load more comments do you support your middle finger with your thumb as well
DIY,not_removed,doubtful if the walls get that hot that far down there are serious other issues going on
DIY,not_removed,its like a baseboard for baseboard
DIY,not_removed,nonquartered quarterround what
DIY,not_removed,shoe has a slightly different profile and looks quite a bit better than the bulkier quarter round if you google shoe moulding or base shoe youll see tons of examples
DIY,not_removed,show her and do it it looks fantastic
DIY,not_removed,takes up way too much floor space and its an old style you dont see these in new homes anymore im on your side here
DIY,not_removed,look how high up the insert is they had to make it tall i think making it tall and short would look off
DIY,not_removed,you could sit on it
DIY,not_removed,cascading bouquets never go out of style i know someone who tried doing the composite bouquet herself she failed so hard it was laughable it looked like a kids art school project
DIY,not_removed,my thoughts exactly plus isnt drywall made of gypsum aka rock
DIY,not_removed,came here to post this he can still reuse the frame but all that tile etc will have to come down when the wall was open was a perfect time to upgrade that junk
DIY,not_removed,hardie board skamol or durrock with tile or stone over it most times trying do a smooth wall over a zero clearance will result in cracking
DIY,not_removed,unfortunately not moved into a smaller apartment right after completing it so i dont have room saving it for the next move simple design though wide poplar strips glued up several coats of poly and hours of sanding routered edge to round it off instead of using breadboard ends
DIY,not_removed,got it i didnt read your comment well enough yes i bet you are right on this
DIY,not_removed,oh okay
DIY,not_removed,its nice to have a fireplace above what generally goes inside a fireplace
DIY,not_removed,uhh no i keep my thumb on the left pinky on the right point ring finger for left and right click middle finger on scroll wheel
DIY,not_removed,quarterround is called that because it is a quarter of a round circle however its also often used as a generic term for that type of piece
DIY,not_removed,so what do you see seriously curious about current design
DIY,not_removed,it produces heat but you dont have to put wood in it it runs off natural gas or propane very popular for people who live in cities that dont want the mess and cost of the wood looks like a real fire but much cleaner
DIY,not_removed,ive been a florist for years now and as much as i applaud pinterest for what they do i always shake my head in disappointment when people see these things and think oh hey that would be so easy no its not fucking easy please try it and see just how easy you think it is im all for diy and if youre a crafty person then by all means do it yourself but theres a reason people are professionals i know ive talked a few people out of doing their own wedding flowers i did my own wedding flowers as a professional and ill tell you one thing ill never do it again it took too much time and i didnt get to enjoy the few days before my wedding because i spent so much time doing the flowers also what pinterest fails to do a lot of the time is show you what the underside of a lot of these bouquets look like most of them use spray adhesive floral binding tape wire glue blah blah blah and it takes hours hours might seem like im bitter but im not i just hate seeing people wasting time and money
DIY,not_removed,most fireplaces will use a cement board or something noncombustible check the user manual that came with the fireplace i work at a fireplace manufacturer and we explicitly state clearances to combustibles in every manual it takes a lot of time and energy to test clearance distances to meet safety standards
DIY,not_removed,the paper covering it isnt made of rock and is flammable that said i have a feeling shitty builders everywhere install fireplaces this way all the time and rarely does a problem occur
DIY,not_removed,where i live its only directly above the fireplace that needs some fireboard in the eyes of inspectors drywall has the paper on either side of it so thats the part that is considered flammible you could look at your fireplace manual for the framing dimensions in the case of this one my guess would be that you should be more concerned with the very low above the fireplace but then again the manufacturer of the fireplace will specify how high it must be your finished product looks very well done though so nice work
DIY,not_removed,the entire country wants the cubs to win the next two ill get behind that
DIY,not_removed,well i was thinking about my trackpad and i now realize the thumb comment was likely about a phone but i dont think ive ever used my middle finger to scroll on a mouse ill have to try that
DIY,not_removed,you know that spray glue the binding tape the wires etc etc all add up in price too whenever i need to slow someone down from taking on a crazy flower diy project i just show them the costs of all the stuff theyll need suddenly a few hundred dollars for a professional doesnt seem like such a bad deal any more
DIY,not_removed,i agree tons of builders do it wrong and before i start this statement it is not directed at you its for anyone in the home building industry reading this thread the problem is that while it is rare in the perfect condition houses do burn down from this but being that i build houses you have to keep telling yourself that people are going to live in these and need to feel and be completely safe and its just unacceptable to knowingly install something against building fire code regardless of how rare the problem is
DIY,not_removed,rarely peoples entire home burns down youre probably good
DIY,not_removed,no each model has its own specifications for clearances it is not determined by geographic location
DIY,not_removed,oh my i think youre correct i am redditing on my phone as well now it hit me hah ive just been using my mouse that way forever its comfortable to me which is the most important thing
DIY,not_removed,bingo
DIY,not_removed,agreed
DIY,not_removed,preach it people need to realize the vast majority of any safety guideline is created to counter something that has actually happened in the past thinking it wont happen to you does nothing to protect you from being that rare case
DIY,not_removed,exactly i like to sleep well at night everything by the book

DIY,not_removed,its the garden table of theseus
DIY,not_removed,i was going to be a smart ass and say it would be easier to burn the old table and start from scratch then read in a comment that it was ops grandfathers unintentional dick status achieved however do want to say that op has mad skillz and please keep posting your projects
DIY,not_removed,its a shame the top parts were beyond repair still a great diy
DIY,not_removed,the wood in the legs looks like chestnut not oak its harder and more rotproof than oak too so likely would have survived this well too too bad chestnut is all but gone in namerica it was the top choice for siding barns until they cut it all down to side barns
DIY,not_removed,please dont leave it outside it looks too nice for that
DIY,not_removed,the splitter tool is called a chisel very nice post btw
DIY,not_removed,i get the spirit of refurbishing an old table but wouldnt this have been done in half the time if you just remade it
DIY,not_removed,my sir that is a fine ax you carry why thank you ive had it my whole life i only just replaced the handle last week and the head i changed last winter is it the same ax is this the same table i think the love is the same so just one dudes opinion but i think you resurrected more than recreated
DIY,not_removed,good job you must have used slit of time in it 😂
DIY,not_removed,wow you have a great eye for spotting a diamond in the rough
DIY,not_removed,awesome looking table and for some reason this post reminded me of a question ive had for years can you make a table or get good lumber off of an olive tree i guess it depends on the tree size
DIY,not_removed,im actually surprised those bridle joints came apart intact well done on the reno op i know quite a few people are giving you shit about is it still the same table the truth is i believe you saved the most important part of the table the legs and support structure did you account for wood movement with your table top those glued up ends will split when the wood expands and contracts with changes in moisture content
DIY,not_removed,it would be hard for me to find wood furniture like this that was assembled with tabs and joinery like that to begin with my oldest furniture is still made with metal brackets and screws this was a good piece to begin with you lost me at the tabletop part did you glue two identical shelves together or sidetoside edit just saw that it was an heirloom table really spectacular job with the renovation jawdropping transformation
DIY,not_removed,at what point do you need to draw a plan why not just go by instinct
DIY,not_removed,
DIY,not_removed,good job restorobro
DIY,not_removed,that top was not original it looks like it was repaired at least once but probably twice or more by someone that was not an experienced woodworker as everything about it was done incorrectly the base is original in your repairs you also made some mistakes that will cause you issues with this down the road and a few other to tips for the next project you attached the top incorrectly the grain is at least running in the correct direction now but it needs to expandcontract across its width with seasonal humidity changes even more so if its going outside you used pocket screws which will not allow that to occur as a result what will likely happen is the the top will crackwarp nandor it will pull the frame apart there are lots of ways to attach the top and still allow for movement clips in a groove enlongated screw holes etc this should be very easy to fix since all you need to do is unscrew the top and reattach it correctly those pegs you drilled out were likely what was holding everything together for this long those were drawbored pegs its an offset hole through the mortisetenon when you hammer the peg in it pulls the joint together nice and tight without the need for glue although thats often use too to make things even stronger a perfect solution for an outdoor table drilling that out the way you do it no longer functions like it should not the end or the world but not great either i have no idea what type of glue you used for this but i see a bunch of white stuff in the joints which doesnt make be believe it was done right a waterproof pva glue would be the best choice here yellow wood glue im not sure if whatever you used will hold up you sanded incorrectly a belt sander is not a tool woodworkers use often if ever for finish work its a tool for removing large amount of material very quickly and will leave deep scratches behind in the wood a random orbit is what you want of a hand plane or scraper instead you also should never skip grits is very course super fine never use above skipping grits you dont get out the scratch marks from the previous grit that shows up every easily when you add finish something like would have been ok stain does not equal finish stain is usually just a pigment suspended in an oil youd use to change the color of a wood the oil itself is pretty much useless to protect the wood for that youd add some of topcoat outdoors youd want something like a marine varish all wood will turn grey out in the elements pretty quickly without something to protect it i have no idea what the product you used is but it doesnt look right
DIY,not_removed,exactly what i was thinking op didnt renovate a table he just bought a junk table and then demolished it and built an exact cop
DIY,not_removed,thanks stranger
DIY,not_removed,thanks i was disappointed about this aswell especially the lower layer however i still can use it for smaller projects maybe
DIY,not_removed,good to know
DIY,not_removed,thanks for the info
DIY,not_removed,yes but i didnt want to throw it out since it has emotional value to me
DIY,not_removed,well it looked like he wanted to re use the old top part but didnt realize it was rotten until after he started
DIY,not_removed,a piece of furniture with emotional significance your faith in the tool using capability of your fellow humans an army of the dead
DIY,not_removed,ive received another comment about this matter will look into it thanks
DIY,not_removed,thanks yes i used two mostly identical shelve parts just to make the top more solid and the table more stable i think it would have been too light before
DIY,not_removed,the pegs were not placed equally on the legs i agree that it would have been possibly just by fiddling around the parts but i think this saved me some time
DIY,not_removed,thanks for the input the finisher i used is labeled for outdoor use and does contain stain as a bonus im pretty sure there were better things to make it last longer but also its not completely wrong the glue is indeed waterproof and only white because it hasnt dried at that point because i used too much and it just got pushed out of the joint its colorless when its dried i will have to collect some know how on how to attach the top correctly thanks again for the input ive read about this matter already but totally forgot about it while attaching the top im pretty sure youre right about the joints but the table was wacky and not safe at all i had to redo them and didnt know how exactly it was done before using normal pegs appeared to do the job for me especially since im not trained professionally again thanks for your advices
DIY,not_removed,httpsenmwiktionaryorgwikirenovate
DIY,not_removed,not only are you being pedantic youre also wrong
DIY,not_removed,it was something his grandfather made and he wanted to restore but found out parts were rotten and had to be replaced
DIY,not_removed,in some ways it makes this even cooler imho i love stuff like this it takes the styles from a previous era an preserves them so much of the stuff we buy now is particle board bullshit
DIY,not_removed,you got me
DIY,not_removed,please post another diy if you do d
DIY,not_removed,to add to that the black pliers are called nippers i didnt know what they were till a few years ago when i got a pair for free and btw awesome work your project came out great
DIY,not_removed,look up sprung joint
DIY,not_removed,the guy said hes not a native english speaker in my experience people trying to learn a new language like to be corrected by native speakers not that he was incorrect as you say so the comment could have been phrased better but by far the more common usage of renovate is for things more than just a piece of furniture most people do in fact call it refurbishing when its a piece of furniture again not that youre wrong but i would rather be taught how people commonly speak not just what is technically accurate when im learning a new language
DIY,not_removed,thanks im not sure if his rep was s
DIY,not_removed,will do
DIY,not_removed,if you really want to make it more sentimental inscribe the story on the bottom of the table grandfather made this table in you refinished the table in keep this table going its part of the family generations of inherited sentiment things like this that get lots of daily use tend to take on a life of their own
DIY,not_removed,i overheard my sons scout leader tell him to be careful with his ax for chopping wood he said it was given to him by a good friend and hes only had to replace the handle three times and the blade once so it had special meaning to him
DIY,not_removed,you should check out the fifth elefant from sir terry pratchetts discworld series it talks a about how we see things as ancient artefacts even if all parts have been renewed
DIY,not_removed,im going to have to be honest with you that sounds interesting but i will not be doing that great response though i appreciate it
DIY,not_removed,i know it looks like you have some wiggle room with the whole you should but hes not asking here is a of your children getting on a school bus
DIY,not_removed,im checking it out now ill brb with confirmation edit ok i really tried i think it was kinda stupid but i did kinda look at it
DIY,not_removed,stupid confirmed go on about your business as if this never happened
DIY,not_removed,furniture grade american plywood or bust i once found a basketball smashed between layers of the chinese stuff
DIY,not_removed,be careful of cheaper plywoods if you plan to leave have exposed plys visible the cheaper the plywood the higher the chance of voids and delaminiation and those might not look that great i have seen good things from the purebond plywood at hd or even better baltic birch plywood is almost always void free
DIY,not_removed,there are plywoods made with thinner plies that have nice looking edges when a finish is applied there was one called teppa that had eleven plies per half inch of thickness which i used a lot to make drawer bodies the edges looked great rounded off with a router sanded and sealed with varathane teppa hasnt been available for a few years but i bet you can still find the same type of thing you might have to get it in halfinch or thinner and glue up pieces to make a thick enough slab for a desktop or tabletop edit okay i can see that i misread your post and you want to have the edges themselves form the top surface if you do this by ripping plywood into strips be sure to use an extremely fine saw blade or more so your cuts have nice smooth edges
DIY,not_removed,yeah if youre going to do this shell out for some voidfree plywood i dont think you can get it off the shelf at bigbox hardware stores so you might have to go to a specialty store

DIY,not_removed,remove the casing then use a sawzall to cut the nails behind the door jamb so the blade will run in between the jamb and framing this becoming accessible once the casing on both sides has been removed from there just pushpry on it and bit and it will slip right out totally under damaged
DIY,not_removed,if you havent taken the door off the hinges i suggest doing that first next take a flat pry bar and carefully removing the trim all the way around the doorway on both sides youll notice a space between the jam and the framing and there will most likely be shims periodically in the gap where you find shims should be where the nails are that hold the jam in place using a reciprocating saw carefully cut the nails along each side of the doorway there shouldnt be any across the top after the nails are cut the jam should be able to be pulled out of the opening edit i might ask why are you trying to remove it if youre just painting you could easily mask it off with plastic or ram board
DIY,not_removed,because she was a heavy smoker and its all stained with smoke all the frames are being repainted thank you for the info
DIY,not_removed,no worries good luck
DIY,not_removed,dont use normal paint nicotine will come through the paint within a few years there are special paints in the market which are designed to be painted over nicotine and other hard to clean dirt
DIY,not_removed,i scrubbed the walls ceilings and all door frames first then did two layers of a smoke stain covering primer that should be plenty right
DIY,not_removed,yeah that should be enough usually you can immediately tell if its nicotine or soot in the wall because nicotine is hideous yellowbrown tar in the cleaning rag and soot is usually more chocolate brown with smoky odour those special paints are best for stuff like popcorn ceiling and other surfaces which you cant clean without ruining it
DIY,not_removed,oh yes i am quite familiar with cigarette tar thank you for the help
DIY,not_removed,i cleaned out my dads old smoking habits some years ago when he had passed away im not envying you for the job good luck with your project
DIY,not_removed,you were probably talking too loud even without knowing it also consider moving out and into your own apartment that you share with friends who dont care how loud you talk
DIY,not_removed,wtf man move out
DIY,not_removed,get a job move out and stop talking to inanimate objects
DIY,not_removed,roxul between the joists then landscape fabric stables over it though if its the right width in the first place friction should hold it in place for the cold air return roxul also has a rigid board made of the same material cut it to the right width use screws washers to cover the cold air return this all assumes you dont have plans to drywall it afterword while youre at it clean up the coax cabling p
DIY,not_removed,mom put on the fucking earmuffs im gettin ready to bait bangs ceiling with broom handle
DIY,not_removed,i would consider buying plastic sheeting and using a staple gun to keep it up there wrap the cold air return in roxul and sheet it too
DIY,not_removed,if you end up going with something like spray foam but it will work very well be aware it is super fucking flammable and needs to be covered by drywall or other approved materials
DIY,not_removed,homosote baby
DIY,not_removed,and look up greenglue
DIY,not_removed,i have always just used regular insulation higher r value is better but depending on the area do you really wanna spring for over for sound deadening youd be surprised how big of a difference it makes easiest way to cover it would be vapor barrier and staple it up as for the cold air return and i apologize for not looking at the picture first there is a thin styrofoam type board for sound dampening its yellow and insanely hard to come by probuild had it back when i needed it it seemingly has the same sounddeadening abilities as from my anecdotal experience i lined the insides of the bay where there was a return air duct off to look at your pics now need to get better about that edit ok yeah just go to your local big box buy a sheet of thick white styrofoam and silicone it to the duct stuff or so into the rest of it staple vapor barrier over it best part is this will all look up to snuff that is it will be expected when you sell the house by any form of inspector as opposed to stapling blankets and newspaper up there given the area you have youre looking at in materials should change the thermal properties of the area considerably too source home construction is my natural state
DIY,not_removed,ma the meatloaf
DIY,not_removed,also when i made the title of this post every word auto capitalized itself not sure what funky nonsense this sub has going on lol
DIY,not_removed,homasote httpwwwhomasotecom
DIY,not_removed,why not just use fabric to dampen noise old clothes are free
DIY,not_removed,id just talk louder
DIY,not_removed,buy mum some ear plugs or send her to a home where old people wait to die ear plugs are cheaper
DIY,not_removed,lol this is hilarious
DIY,not_removed,im not sure if this is sarcasm or not but im getting the impression most people think im a full fledged adult
DIY,not_removed,god dammit why do i have to fix the wow guys mistakes
DIY,not_removed,thanks
DIY,not_removed,sorry doubling up here but do you know what could be done about the cold air return
DIY,not_removed,not true there are spray foams that are fire resistant theyre typically orange
DIY,not_removed,i might use this on the cold air return it only has a nrc of whereas roxul is more like at typical speech frequencies
DIY,not_removed,hey my dude so i got boards of this stuff how do you recommend putting it on the ceiling i was going to use liquid nails and screws with washers is that overkill this shits heavy
DIY,not_removed,it goes between the sheets of drywall you and mom are installing on your isolation channeled ceiling iso channels are at home depot my parents had styro that fit into the cold air return i think at any rate thats where your mom hears you any chance you can call the heating company and get the return moved it cant be impossible or move yo ass to the other side of the basement you need to get away from that sound tunnel
DIY,not_removed,im unsure what sub i was in now but i started to post the other day and it insisted on making the title all caps i just gave up
DIY,not_removed,the stuff im looking at is x inches for im not sure what constitutes regular vs sound stuff this is just what i say frequently used in this sub but if i dont cover the cold air return then wont all the other insulation be pointless i would think sound would go right through it its the cold air return that connect directly to my moms room which is right above me
DIY,not_removed,denial
DIY,not_removed,because i said so thats why
DIY,not_removed,add some regular fiberglass insulation air will go through it and it will act like a filter but it will help muffle sound
DIY,not_removed,for that kind of money just use regular insulation batts either kraft backed you staple into place or bare then you cover with plastic sheeting i would kraft back it like said buy the right thickness looks like and do not over compress insulation the sound absorption comes from the loose fibers being loose not compressed then i would sheetrock over it but the way to do this for sound proofing is a bit different you run strips every across those floor joists and screw your sheetrock to those strips simply put sound waves travel through solid surfaces readily so you want as few points of solid contact as possible the sound transfer through those strips through the floor joists is only every inches if you screwed directly to the joists the sound waves would have a direct solid line for the whole length of every joist hope that is understandable also after you put up the fir strips peel some thin pieces of insulation to lay under that return vent those transfer sound like a bullhorn good luck hope it helps this can be done for a couple hundred bucks cheap compared to some sound covering that wont reduce the noise as much
DIY,not_removed,im not saying he should use spray foam im merely correcting a factually incorrect statement

DIY,not_removed,be careful about paint and anything else that has voc volatile organic compounds i painted my living room last year and lost all my fish two days later fish store said it was because of the painting consult your fish store they might be able to help
DIY,not_removed,it just looks like varnished timber you can paint over varnish as long as your using a darker colour just give it a light sand beforehand im not super sure but i think you can can give it a light sand and paint over it with normal paint as well just check at your local paint shop
DIY,not_removed,chalk paint you can find it at craft stores or look at pinterest and make your own
DIY,not_removed,there is no reason new paint cant go on the stand because of the stand however you cant apply a new finish on a piece of furniture sitting on a carpet and expect the carpet to not take some hits also paint fumes are a thing even with acrylics or chalk paints you appear to have air stones i would take appropriate precautions
DIY,not_removed,i agree chalk paint can go over nearly anything without needing to treat or sand it first ive pained loads of furniture without any issues and looks like would do perfectly for you ive always bought annie sloan paint and its been great never tried any other brand so cant comment if they are all as good or not
DIY,not_removed,drywall contractor here i specialise in plaster rehab its very easy just get a sheet of drywall cut rips and screw to the face of the studs that will bring the finish wall to the same plain also if you cut the rolled edge off and put it against the base it will be easier to finish
DIY,not_removed,rigid foam insulation would make a good shim and give you a little thermal break and extra insulation theres stuff called fanfold thats used under siding that might work or lots of options in sheets
DIY,not_removed,we just crossed this bridge with a bathroom remodel i just finished up i ended up just adding a second layer of drywall to the affected wall and built it back out to the previous level made the corners easier to tape and mud anyway
DIY,not_removed,i would shim all the studs that seems like the easiest solution putting some strange super thick molding at the base would just look odd and my guess is you will regret it down the road
DIY,not_removed,shim it in place and put additional molding to cover the cap you tube stacked molding there are many ways that used to be used to highlight and transform moldings
DIY,not_removed,shoe mounding quarter round unless your base is pretty short i have and it looks fine
DIY,not_removed,baseboard and quarter round will cover it
DIY,not_removed,this is a fantastic job looks great i wanna do something like this someday
DIY,not_removed,good idea and execution it also keeps pests and vandals away from your trash besides hiding those ugly cans from sight

DIY,not_removed,i think youll want to price out the parts before you decide to go with galvanized pipe between all the fittings and the threading your going to spend alot of money it will also be subject to rusting so if youre in anything other than a very dry climate youll need to paint or otherwise protected it if you really need something for multiple bikes and what is offered premade doesnt work for you id suggest trying some local welding or steel fabrication shops the pipe and welding will probably be cheaper than the plumbing pipe approach
DIY,not_removed,thread the remaining head off the line it is connected to go to home depot and get a replacement then thread the new one back into the water supply you will probably want to dig up a little section to give you some room sourcepeople suck at backing up out of my driveway
DIY,not_removed,dig down around it and find where the head screws into the pipe then unscrew it and go buy another like it reverse steps dig deep enough so dirt doesnt go into the pipe the water comes out of if its broke at the threads then its a bigger job

DIY,not_removed,where exactly are the threads i hope its not that edit apparantly just the part that screws google says sorry im just a kid
DIY,not_removed,a few inches below the ground where the head separated from the water line dont be sorry youre learning something new
DIY,not_removed,if your height is under two inches you could use self levelling concrete as indicated below but even then i wouldnt do it do you have a vertical or slanted transition between the two spaces regardless this is your opportunity to get this right and make it last rent a roto hammer for a day buy a big box or two of tapcons concrete screws and create a nice little grid of screws that stick up out of the concrete leaving space between the top of the screws and what would be the top of a new slab build a form around the external perimeter of the sloped space ie not the shared side with the other space and fill it level with the other space using high strength or fiber reinforced concrete available at home depot or lowes feather the surface over the existing slab and let dry that should be all you need to do the tapcons are in place of doweling where you would use rebar to provide structure for the new slab to grab onto because you are dealing with something thats probably only to start and dont have a ton of space to make up this is a smaller version of that
DIY,not_removed,hi there are several things to consider when building a permanent structure one of those things is frost jacking if you live in an environment that freezes from timetotime and dont want your shed to jack out of the ground or sink with time you need to build a foundation wall that goes down to footings that extend below the frost line if you dont care then you can just build at grade the second thing you want to watch out for is how close youre building to the property line driveways are very often very close to the property line so you may want to watch out that you are not within the limiting distance to your property line set by your local municipality my area is inches or by the building materials and cladding that you are selecting has to do with fires spreading from property to property now all of that aside if you dont care about frost jacking or it doesnt apply to you the easiest thing to do will be to pour concrete up to a level that works to support a wood framed structure i do not recommend putting wood down directly on your driveway as it will tend to rot away in a few years time hope this helps

DIY,not_removed,paper mache will work if thick enough i made a pretty big stay puff marshmallow man head that was wicked solid
DIY,not_removed,fiberglass layup incredibly messy but its basically the same process as papier mache except the end result is going to be indestructible
DIY,not_removed,paper mache will hold up just use lots heck we had to take down and cut open a pinata that i made for my kids birthday because no matter how many times we hit it first with a stick then a bat it wouldnt break
DIY,not_removed,this might be an option after you have your frame you can paint on some of the epoxy that hardens fiberglass in order to give it more stregnth then sand smooth so the baloon doesnt pop
DIY,not_removed,ive seen similar done with small balloons and starch if memory serves me check pinterest could do that and then some epoxy id wrap the twine after it was almost totally inflated also what about some spray foam
DIY,not_removed,if you go for paper mache you can treat it with a resin layer post paint to reinforce it
DIY,not_removed,you can do one better here you can get aluminum mesh and actually use a real pumpkin and contour the mesh over it one half at a time cover the mesh in celluclay and let it dry with a fan then take the two halves off then paint elmers glue on the back side and let it dry to harden it from the inside the put the two halves together and using more celluclay seal it up as one piece you will have a pumpkin that actually looks like a pumpkin and it will be very strong as well
DIY,not_removed,instead of twine make a sphere skeleton out of bent metal rods bamboo etc sorta like this then inflate the balloon inside and use paper mache
DIY,not_removed,instead of using a balloon just use a plastic liner fill it with water and do the bottom half using bondo or epoxy or thick paper machette or concrete then flip it over reapply the liner fill with water epoxy etc the water provides more force to keep the shape and the liner wont pop
DIY,not_removed,you could try your plan as stated but after the first few coats are done do a small layer of fabric strips that goes once around the circumference above that holding that first bit down go top to bottom in the creases of the pumpkin if you add more layers of paper on top of that it might provide some extra strength to stop it from bulging or sagging
DIY,not_removed,plaster of paris and fiberglass mat will work for this this is what the architectural world calls gfrg glass fiberreinforced gypsum ideally it would be made with gypsum cement but that is not commonly available granted it would have to be painted well in order to be outside in the weather but it will will be selfsupporting with a shell thickness of about
DIY,not_removed,no need for a fiber glass spray just use fiberglass strips
DIY,not_removed,can we see the old one that sounds awesome
DIY,not_removed,just spray it with polyurea same stuff as rhino linings or linex you might even have a local shop willing to do it edit httpsyoutubekhqxemwcog
DIY,not_removed,i would make a rabbit wire frame and spray foam it to the right general shape after it cures use hand tools to refine the shape paper mache the whole thing to get the right texture and paint it we built a giant tree for a show a few years back in generally the same way with the addition of a steel frame to support a treehouse worked out pretty well
DIY,not_removed,if this was already posted or said no to i am sorry but i cant bring myself to reading every comment perhaps you could use yarn soaked on glue that you wrap around the balloon after the glue dries you should be left with a structure you will probably need to reinforce it but yarn should be a relative easy material to work and cast in so you can finalize the shape before you make it more rigid pusur
DIY,not_removed,dont rebuild the pumpkin instead build a wooden box that youd like to see next to that pumpkin notch out the remaining part of damaged pumpkin so the box fits snug in its place get creative here if your theme is scary build a casket if your theme is fairy tail build a tiny stage coach if there is no theme just build a box and paint it to look like ivy the inside of the box can still be hollow you can paint it to match the inside of the pumpkin good luck
DIY,not_removed,the current one has an underlying frame of chicken wire though with the balloon acting as a frame we would lose this stronger wire frame and then once the balloon pops we lose all of the framing
DIY,not_removed,pictures
DIY,not_removed,the epoxy used to harden fiberglass will get to hot and likely pop the balloon mid wrap
DIY,not_removed,spray foam would be nice except it expands too far and mishapen if it could be put on in even coats maybe
DIY,not_removed,that would work except there are no pumpkins large enough for this project we are talking about a foot pumpkin here
DIY,not_removed,that is an interesting thought this might be the winner
DIY,not_removed,deleted
DIY,not_removed,let me look through my archive for them
DIY,not_removed,balloonpaper machefiberglass then
DIY,not_removed,the glass fibers might pop it too hmmm i like your blanket idea below but how about using kraft paper strips and some other strong glue that wont melt in the rain i dont know if epoxy resin will get hot enough if used in smaller amounts
DIY,not_removed,can confirm used to use paper mache to make halloween costume heads every year blow up a big balloon and cover it with paper mache and let dry for a couple days pop balloon and your off
DIY,not_removed,that would work but at this point i would think that fiberglass would be overkill you could cut up an old shirt or blanket as long as it was cotton or fleece and just use the fiberglass epoxy to finish it up so long as the material is porous to absorb the epoxy you are golden plus the shirtblanket would be much easier to work with as it wouldnt have any loose strands to keep off your gloves and paintbrush
DIY,not_removed,using paper would have to be more like tissue paper in order to get it to conform to the right pumpkin shape or the paper may kink if i am imagining the design of this thing correctly and it will take a whole lot of tissue paper to be structurally sound my thoughts are to use paper mache to make a template and cover that with fleece to be epoxied to help it keep structure likely all of this would have to be sanded down as to not pop the balloon i am not sure how the old one broke down or if it did an enclosure for a balloon isnt small or easy to store but this could potentially be made modular in order to put away after use if uhobbes has a picture of the old one it would be helpful
DIY,not_removed,the old one was not made with a balloon it was made with a wooden frame and chicken wire which has paper mache around it it has holes in it from mice but it can be repaired the problem is that the chicken wire doesnt lend itself to a very round shape so the pumpkin has a few flat spots that look strange my hope is to create a new one without that problem as for a picture i have been trying to find one on fb with no luck i will definitely post when i can as for the paper not working i think newspaper will suffice we are talking about a fairly large pumpkin at feet in diameter
DIY,not_removed,just cut out the flat spots and redo repaint shiny and new unless its super trashed even then the frame may be worth using something to consider is that the chicken wire frame has lasted years thats a good track record for that design
DIY,not_removed,nice

DIY,not_removed,your best bet is to add more paint around it there is not much you can do
DIY,not_removed,a fair portion of the wall looks like this assuming i do a pretty fine sandpaper
DIY,not_removed,use a medium one to make it go faster youll probably have to do a light coat over it once your done i would use a sanding block instead of normal sandpaper
DIY,not_removed,id use a pole with a sanding attachment or it will be murder on your arms or courser and no question it will need another coat afterwards

DIY,not_removed,hey all im looking for some advice on drywalling my garage as you can see from the link half of the garage is already completed im looking to finish the last wall but i had some questions that i hope to get some input from as you can see from the first image there is a bit of a ledge of concrete can i simply rest the bottom of the drywall on top of that the second image shows how the original drywall is secondly it looks like there is a power wire thats run towards the top of the wall i see that the original drywall covers it what might be easiest is to just drywall up to the wire itself and leave it lastly is there any specific insulation that i should put behind the drywall any input is greatly appreciated as im completely new to this
DIY,not_removed,a hammer the name of the tool youre describing is a hammer

DIY,not_removed,ok turns out i may need an anchor if its drywall and no the name of the tool i am describing is a hammer drill not a hammer sorry
DIY,not_removed,the only thing you need to drive nails assuming you mean nails and not screws is a hammer a hammer drill is for drilling not hammering and nails need to be hammered not drilled if youre putting anchors in drywall then all you need is a drill hammer option absolutely not necessary and way overkill and a screwdriver to put the anchor in drill a pilot hole then push in the anchor to the threads and use the screwdriver to screw it in the rest of the way drywall anchors tend to come in plastic or aluminum plastic anchors for blinds is plenty strong enough aluminum is way overkill
DIY,not_removed,there was probably a much easier way to do this but i pretty much only used materials i already had in my house
DIY,not_removed,good brother thanks for sharing
DIY,not_removed,it looked kinda cool before anyway i would have at least sanded the old design back before painting it black

DIY,not_removed,i would suspect the dimmer went bad they do that from time to time is it a standard dimmer switch on the wall
DIY,not_removed,it is yes an older version of this
DIY,not_removed,id just go ahead and replace it if nothing else it will rule out the dimmer if it doesnt fix the issue

DIY,not_removed,so you want to make apps for cardboard google vr httpsdevelopersgooglecomvr
DIY,not_removed,i definitely didnt have all of those normalwork conditions in mind i had thought of the sweat issue which i figured id be able to prevent or fix by installing small quite fans probably about a quarter or half dollar size within the helmet to help with outside temperature condensation creation as well as breathing and human body temp but ill definitely put those down on paper to tackle thanks for these suggestions what else would you recommend i take a look into doing to prevent normal working condition issues
DIY,not_removed,no negative i do not want to have it become a device thats bulky or impractical the carboard google vr is a dope idea but just seems impractical outside of a home environment or movieamusement area id like to actually create programs not just applications which adds true functionality to the helmet thank you for the link ill still read up on their program as it might be helpful for my goal
DIY,not_removed,guess i should not of been so short let me expand a little if you make your helmets able to attach a phone in the visor section you fix all your issues immediately then you would code the app to use the on board camera to show whats in front of you and then make a hud to interact with the camera and any other features on your helmet like extra camera or sensors maybe of the idea of google glass is closer to what you are looking at instead by using regular vision more httpsdevelopersgooglecomglass not saying you cant but companies are putting millions into what you are also trying to do google does share a lot of its tools at least looking at and figuring out some of the hurdles they have already jumped might be a good way to go good luck
DIY,not_removed,i understand and i didnt take your initial answer in any negative manner i feel if i just allow for a phone to be attached then i wont bring my dreamidea to life and plus a phone would be very restrictive in what i would like to accomplish with this helmet design and negative google glass is a dope product but not what i would use id rather build everything from the ground up instead of swapping in and out massproduced tech into the helmet thank you for your suggestions and although i didnt agree with them they do give me reading material to aid me in my goal
DIY,not_removed,looks like a plug at first glance converting it to a standard outlet could start a fire dont do that
DIY,not_removed,wow ive seen outlets with the sideways slit in it and always wondered what king of plug went into it
DIY,not_removed,you do not convert anything the plug is designed that way for a reason that is a amp plug meant to go into a amp outlet that outlet is rated for caring more than a standard amps and so is the wiring and breaker converting what ever tool you have to use a standard prong outlet means what ever line you plug into will constantly trip the breaker
DIY,not_removed,looks like a volt plug it will not run off a standard house plug in and converting it to an end that will plug into a standard outlet will not work since they are only volt
DIY,not_removed,can google nema straight blade reference chart to find a chart that will show you what it is also
DIY,not_removed,that is a plug not designed to be plugged into your appliance will not work on regular house current

DIY,not_removed,this will not be possible as it appears to be a nema plug its incompatible with nema sockets due to voltage difference httpsenwikipediaorgwikinemaconnector should give you more than enough info on the nema standard
DIY,not_removed,dose the item the plug is from have a platesticker that tells the voltage it takes
DIY,not_removed,this is the correct answer relectricians
DIY,not_removed,that is a amp plug when you see an outlet with a sideways slit it means the wiring and breaker can handle up to amps of power where a standard outlet will only handle
DIY,not_removed,in my experience a little bit of research first is a good idea and plugging a device that expects into a outlet can prove to be detrimental to some devices

DIY,not_removed,a kiln is a big oven made specifically for pottery and ceramics
DIY,not_removed,glass is best done with a mask and chemical etch or laser engraving for a mask you can use a vinyl cutter to make a sticker for the parts you dont want etched or hand cut a stickon mask for laser youll need a laser with a rotary y stage that rotates the glass search for local makerspaces and you will find people who might be able to help as well as access to equipment for a membership fee

DIY,not_removed,thanks ill give that a try
DIY,not_removed,theyre for acoustics not insulation
DIY,not_removed,had a similar situation in my fathers old business had to run the cables outside of the walls we tried pvc pipe but it looked tacky even tried painting it my father decided to make moulding with space for the cables behind it we laid all the cable out and tacked it to the wall where we needed it then he measured the width of the cables that were side by side and made some custom trim and moulding to cover it up not sure if it would work for your buisness or if its something you would want to tackle
DIY,not_removed,what about floorattic im a camera installer myself pvc warps and fades outside i wouldnt do it inside either if they cut the cables youll probably already have them on tapedepending on where you have cameras setup if you can run them through the attic or under the floor much cleaner and you cant retrace them back to the dvr as easily hit me with a pm if you need help networking them to your phone cheers
DIY,not_removed,have you ever seen cable trays used in commercial construction for cable management comes in dozens of sizes from ittybitty to omg httpwwwcableorganizercomppanduitfiberrunercableroutingsystems for illustration only but you get the idea
DIY,not_removed,outside of the wall as in outdoors or on the inside of the building surface mounted to the drywall do you have a drop ceiling or open metal rafters or is the ceiling drywalled up too whats the structure of the building would be a better question if it is wooden framed but drywalled ceilings there may be strapping between the joist and the sheetrock which would allow you to fish the cables through but you need to provide more info
DIY,not_removed,i would suggest hiring professionals to run wires through the wall if there is even one blind spot on the wires you could easily get robbed
DIY,not_removed,quick thought wireless bridge to eliminate runs but this introduces a bit more complexity or just getting a couple switches to reduce the number of cables running through the place would make this way easier then your not draping cables across your ceiling and only hiding one or two that can be done tastefully by using a similar colored cable to the walls most people wont even notice it as long as it is tight and not draping in front of their faces in a bright green color edit maybe a wireless camera system should be considered for this application cameras are a reactive measure so unless you have someone watching them all the time that many of them sounds like overkill for a single story
DIY,not_removed,powerline adapters id never use anything else
DIY,not_removed,yeah thats what im afraid of its gonna look tacky its a retail store so it has to look atleast a bit presentable ill check and see if i can find some molding that would fit properly thanks for the suggestion that might be a really good option too much better looking than pvc
DIY,not_removed,no basement no attic we rent the floor out to a tenant but theres no crawl space or any accessible space between our floor and the floor above im going with a flir system ive used them before at my house i did my house last year using the flir system and its working very very well i was able to route cables inwall in the house but its almost impossible to do that in my current situation
DIY,not_removed,i like the wire basket trays more visibility if ever you need to trace a cable
DIY,not_removed,no no drop ceiling its dry walled but theres large steel ibeams that go through the ceiling as well as various metal aluminum or a thin sheet metal frames for housing a few things which go across both ceiling and walls we renovated the building a few years ago so i know that there isnt any form of access from front to back through the walls or ceiling it would be indoor not outdoor there is an easily accessible conduit for outdoor wiring which our original coax cables are running through right now for the existing system
DIY,not_removed,cant really do powerline adaptors for this type of equipment it would be great if we could
DIY,not_removed,good ol this old house even has a
DIY,not_removed,is there shelving along the walls could you go behind that
DIY,not_removed,wow this seems like a great option thats pretty easy to do

DIY,not_removed,for me it depends redoing my bathroom no finishing my basement yes it really depends on whether someone buying the house years down the road would wonder why the layout differs from the county assessment records
DIY,not_removed,flatbeds are a much more efficient use of space than the standard box i wish they came as part of the standard package of options available the only downside is that the deck is like a foot higher making it slightly harder to get equipment onto the back
DIY,not_removed,you did a amazing jobbut you must distract a shit ton of drivers with that thing
DIY,not_removed,why the angled corners instead of square
DIY,not_removed,looks great rig up some mud flaps
DIY,not_removed,wont all your stuff just fall off when you turn
DIY,not_removed,can we get some pics of the toolbox i want a new bed just for that
DIY,not_removed,as a truck owner myself i dont understand how someone thinks this version is useful i dont see a wheel mount or tie downs seems like you can tie a couple things on there but nowhere near the utility of a bed looks cool though
DIY,not_removed,fucking awesome you pulled off a good looking flat bed
DIY,not_removed,damn that looks great i wouldnt mind having that on my navara
DIY,not_removed,a flatbed is the best thing every if youre a farmer or rancher great job
DIY,not_removed,nice job sir after first pic i was gonna ask why the non square corners but you answered it right away looks great for what your gonna do with it
DIY,not_removed,looks sweet are you gonna put some mudflaps on the rearwheels
DIY,not_removed,what kind of welder would one use for a project like this id like to learn to weld to be able to do projects similar to this stationary thingsnothing id put on a moving vehicle for everyones safety
DIY,not_removed,fantastic job i needed to replace the rotten bed of my a few years ago i dont have the metal working skills but i have built a deck before so i built a small deck to replace the bed
DIY,not_removed,ive always wondered about these things what are the advantages over a standard box
DIY,not_removed,so
DIY,not_removed,looks good dude
DIY,not_removed,ive been contemplating a flatbed for my for a while now and i may shamelessly steal inspiration from your design seriously though that came out stunning
DIY,not_removed,as a truck guy i gotta say that this is awesome
DIY,not_removed,when the apocalypse comes you can mount a turret on it and go to town
DIY,not_removed,am i blind or are turn signals not a thing where youre from
DIY,not_removed,thanks for showing us your bed youre such a tease only showing us a hint of your box i bet you can put all kinds of tools in there ill see myself out
DIY,not_removed,what a tragic waste of a nice pick up truck
DIY,not_removed,lol that thing weighs way more then the original bed of your truck and thats a so every pound of payload capacity is precious good job basically making your truck useless and any load worth hauling on it over your axles weight rating
DIY,not_removed,about half that inches it just feels like a foot when youre lifting heavy stuff
DIY,not_removed,i mean you can just buy a regular flat bed if you want
DIY,not_removed,why
DIY,not_removed,they drive around here all the time guess its more of a rural thing
DIY,not_removed,back up turn around go backno seriously that what they are for turning around in tight places
DIY,not_removed,this
DIY,not_removed,most people with trucks cary lots of tie downs and other useful truck things for example i keep a good or so tie downs recovery straps a chain sizes of tow balls jumper cables and if im going far enough ill take tools to get me by
DIY,not_removed,made side pockets for rails if i want them
DIY,not_removed,tie downs did you miss the rub rail and stake pockets for moving bulky items this is incredibly usefulfar more so than a wide bed also a ton should never have a wheel
DIY,not_removed,did you miss the part where he had gone into a ditch and the bed was fucked beyond repair this is a pretty good alternative to paying thousands for a new truck bed assuming he didnt have comprehensive insurance
DIY,not_removed,as a truck owner i would kill for a flat bed i hate having bed sides that get in the way
DIY,not_removed,its a half ton crew cab shortbed not much use in a wheel
DIY,not_removed,not op but you could use a stick welder or a mig welder for a project like this stick arc welders are very cheap and pack a good amount of amperage heat into a small package i have an old craftsman dual range stick welder i picked up from craigslist for bucks for big and ugly work mig welders are more expensive but might be a little easier for a beginner there are amp welders out there if you dont have a outlet but they arent very powerful wouldnt want to build something like the ops project without a decent machine thin work and precise work are best done with tig but thats a whole new learning curve
DIY,not_removed,i dont mind i borrowed all my ideas from pictures of other peoples stuff the only trick item was the tool box and thats probably not an original idea either
DIY,not_removed,i have em on there they are just temps until i make up my mind on a more permanent solution
DIY,not_removed,where there is construction or wielding you will find these sign of a good wielder is how well he can make a work bed for his truck as a standard one is much less efficient for them not trying to be rude only helpful think or research before you type
DIY,not_removed,new bed weighs in at lbs ish not sure what the old bed weighedmaybe with the tailgate cargo capacity for this model is to lbs i believe should be enough for what i do in everyday life as far as hauling
DIY,not_removed,yes but dear lord the price tag on some
DIY,not_removed,you need some flaps man youre going to ruin so many windshields throwing rocks with those wheels unprotected out the back
DIY,not_removed,are you me
DIY,not_removed,seems like an annoyance when just carrying a couple of things that might not fit on the front seat but yeah i guess its the only solution if you absolutely need a pickup i wonder how all of europe manages the only people i see with pickup trucks are gardening or landscaping companies and even that is a rare occurrence
DIY,not_removed,thats a good idea
DIY,not_removed,i did miss those on mobile previously couldnt see them i think its only useful for moving bulky items that dont fit in the bed of a truckwhich is a pretty rare occurrence unless youve moving the same bulky object over over still cool just dont see a frequent useneed for it
DIY,not_removed,i saw that he needed a new bed but you can get one of those from a salvaged truck for wwwcarpartcom hes clearly handy and putting a bed on is pretty simple would have likely cost less been faster and more useful again still a cool project sort of reminds me of this type of project
DIY,not_removed,i have access to several welding machines in the shop from idealarc s to esabs even a suitcase tig but my go to machine is a miller like a top
DIY,not_removed,i dont think he got the point
DIY,not_removed,flaps going on today
DIY,not_removed,probly
DIY,not_removed,i wonder how all of europe manages people in europe typically use vans instead of pickup trucks
DIY,not_removed,i think thats what he put a toolbox on maybe
DIY,not_removed,thats more then likely why he built his tool box most people opt to install in bed tool box instead though plus most trucks now a days have a rear seat like the other guy said
DIY,not_removed,you may not carry bulky items but why would you assume the op doesnt
DIY,not_removed,it opens up options though beds like this arent uncommon where i live people use them on field services trucks or to haul atvs for smaller things there are slots to insert sides on the bed with a truck like that im guessing he has to move things other than the occasional couch
DIY,not_removed,needs to have a stripper on them bonus points for a fat stripper
DIY,not_removed,rcalgary approves
DIY,not_removed,we hire a cargo taxi
DIY,not_removed,i think a lot of people arrange for delivery same as here if you have a small car
DIY,not_removed,i lay mulch for grandfather every summer and he just lives on a standard yard with some landscaping i fill the bed of my long bed times with bags of mulch cant imagine how much a small farm would need
DIY,not_removed,im not assuming that im saying i dont see the use unless youre doing that if op said im moving farm equipment frequently then id say makes sense
DIY,not_removed,another useful feature of a flatbed is you can load and unload from the sides
DIY,not_removed,thats what im saying unless its purpose built for something he has to frequently do
DIY,not_removed,we do it our selfs or call a friend with a truck
DIY,not_removed,why so adamant on attempting to shooting this thing down bud
DIY,not_removed,yeah you guys are self sufficient
DIY,not_removed,im not trying to shoot it downits still very cool people just keep commenting to me explaining how useful it is i honestly think its just unique and cool to look at and should be presented that way
DIY,not_removed,you know what thats totally fair i respect your view
DIY,not_removed,i dont think there is any cheaper kit on the market than the mighty mule unless you want to order directly from china hd has the mm for about as for the zwave that was covered last year if you want to order it direct from china note this model is low voltage volts they are also available for line voltage battery power would mean no running power out to the gate

DIY,not_removed,buy a good looking fan and run a circuit to it through the ceiling
DIY,not_removed,depending on how fancy you wanna go id say try a few nails d maybe polish em a sleeved screw you can find all sorts of stuff to fit over a screw into a drywall anchor might work
DIY,not_removed,ive used these before they look nice and dont tarnish has a felt lining so the gun doesnt get marred

DIY,not_removed,i did a similar paint job on my schwinn about years ago the paint is chipping only in places where the car bike mount touches the bike otherwise its holding up well the chips are small enough to ignore and i think the paint is good enough for a bike like this this bike is just fantastic on flat ground but really hard to climb any sort of inclinehill
DIY,not_removed,looks good people are saying you shouldnt have used spray paint you took a bike that didnt work and looked like shit and you cleaned it up and made it work sure the paint itself will chip where you lock it up and what not but who really cares
DIY,not_removed,looks great one question how did you get all the rust off the wheels and handlebars or are those new parts
DIY,not_removed,nice add some stripes in there
DIY,not_removed,sort of almost all bikes are powder coated from the factory prepping the existing powder coat which is a fantastic base coat for paint and applying paint on that is the right way to approach a quick and dirty restoration like this ops approach has maintained all of the durability of a proper powder coat at the cost of a couple cans of paint well done sure the paint may chip and ding a bit in time paint is much less resilient than powdercoat but that will reveal the original durable powder coat not raw metal anyone who takes a bike frame down to raw metal to paint is going to regret it paint on metal is no substitute to powder coat well done op enjoy your swanky new look bike
DIY,not_removed,why spend on a bike worth the spray paint will chip and what not but i dont think they are restoring a show bike
DIY,not_removed,i got the bike for and the paint is holding up just fine i did three coats of paint followed by two coats of clear coat
DIY,not_removed,i just used steel wool on the handlebars and brake handles and such then used a wire wheel on a bench grinder to get the rust off the wheels i couldve used steel wool for the wheels too but the wire wheel was easier its actually really impressive how well steel wool takes rust off of chrome
DIY,not_removed,thanks im looking at fixing up some old bikes and had no idea on how to deal with the rusty rims
DIY,not_removed,total cost was about including rocks and lights
DIY,not_removed,its almost like a frag tank i like it would be great for shorter hobbyists
DIY,not_removed,the long shallow look is fabulous and the cabinet looks meant to me whats your total gallonage
DIY,not_removed,not a criticism it looks very good and i can appreciate the effort you puylt into it however im a home builder an architecture and used to design furniture and i tbink you could in the long run have an issue wth the way you frames the corners this tank is going to weigh to lbs plus gravel and rocks so maybe closer to you butt lapped the cross beams and legs meaning the the weight is being held by the nails and hopefully lots of glue ideally you would have put the cross beams over the legs making sure to use the vertical strength of the leg not the shear strength of the nail the braces will help but the bending strength lx of as beams is only about lbs so the two is about and with a span of feet even with the braces may be on the lite side i do tend to overengineer so it may be fine i just thought id give you a heads up
DIY,not_removed,it looks amazing
DIY,not_removed,very nice i think it would be cool if the fixture was white and right behind the lights to give an illusion of floating lights
DIY,not_removed,i yelled like my team made a touchdown when i saw the bean animal overflow great going
DIY,not_removed,absolutely amazing i can only dream
DIY,not_removed,awesome job op
DIY,not_removed,restecp who use ducktape as handles
DIY,not_removed,looks great have you had any fish go over the overflow i had a few blennies that would always find their way into the sump when i had a full overflow like that added some gutter guard to prevent it which didnt look great but stopped the fish escapes
DIY,not_removed,very cool
DIY,not_removed,nice build really cool dimensions on that tank looks like youre going lps dominant from the looks of it
DIY,not_removed,how much are you topping off per day that is a lot of surface area for such a small volume of water otherwise looks good
DIY,not_removed,now just make sure you dont put freshwater fish in saltwater or vice versa
DIY,not_removed,that means a lot thank you
DIY,not_removed,not including fish and coral
DIY,not_removed,thanks i really like the shallow tanks it also made my lighting a lot cheaper being so shallow it does limit my coral choices but i have places in the tank ranging from par so i can do most of them i just cant buy ones that mainly grow vertically
DIY,not_removed,the display tank is about gallons i have around total
DIY,not_removed,ha thank you
DIY,not_removed,i appreciate the feedback there is tons of glue tons ha the picture of the stand shows the bracing having compression on the support below rather than depending on the screws and glue its also just long and has a support in the middle so really only of unsupported length im hoping it will be ok guess well see if i notice any bowing ill get another stand built asap
DIY,not_removed,he has the on the inside of the legs to take the weight of the screws there is nothing wrong with this stand
DIY,not_removed,cubic inches gallons lbs the gravel and rocks displace water and probably weigh less than the water displaced he has under the beams next to the legs so it isnt just nails holding it up in other words this stand is more than adequate
DIY,not_removed,thanks
DIY,not_removed,thats a good idea it would make maintenance harder unless i could make a cool hinge to let it flip up and still point down ill look into it
DIY,not_removed,haha it was pretty much my only choice everything else has some sort of flaw as of now my skimmers air intake is the loudest part of my tank
DIY,not_removed,what is the advantage of this type of setup
DIY,not_removed,yes my scooter blenny did that once i have strainers on the pipes now so he was just in the overflow i just netted him and put him back in the tank
DIY,not_removed,yea mainly i like the extra movement and how much less hungry they are
DIY,not_removed,nothing visible ill measure tonight and let you know its glass which is overkill for this depth of tank
DIY,not_removed,it really depends on the humidity outside but i go through gallons a week usually
DIY,not_removed,yea thats another sizable chunk of change
DIY,not_removed,what is your lighting for a tank so shallow can you get away with just led for this or are you doing as well
DIY,not_removed,you can fix it by doubling the legs by adding a to the inside of each leg
DIY,not_removed,thanks i agree and dont lose any sleep about it holding the tank
DIY,not_removed,its really quiet compared to most overflows and allows you to easily adjust your overflow for how much water flow you want
DIY,not_removed,two things its extremely quiet and it is very safe it restarts without priming if there is a short power outage if one or even two pipes clog it still shouldnt flood the floor it also doesnt create the micro bubbles that some other overflows do
DIY,not_removed,yeah ill take wavy lps over neon sticks any time
DIY,not_removed,including future fish and coral hahahah you going sps at all miss my reef tank but not the fear i had leaving for a weekend
DIY,not_removed,its all led i have six truelumen leds three on each half two marine fusion and one actinic
DIY,not_removed,i did if you look at the picture of the frame the vertical sports have two each
DIY,not_removed,good point i forgot about those pesky laws of physics i dont think they add a significant amount of weight
DIY,not_removed,ooh i like the part where it doesnt flood things that always struck me as huge potential disaster with other systems is there some downside a reason why everyone doesnt run a system like this also since you seem to be in questionanswering mode and ive always been interested in a saltwater tank why is it that the light is so often heavily weighted to the end of the spectrum in most saltwater tanks i mean i understand that maybe the corals might need more of that spectrum but is there some harm in adding more white light so i can see more color often they just look like a blue wash to me i actually noticed the effect seems to be less strong in your tank or your photos than most
DIY,not_removed,i am loving the lps at the moment hammers and acans i bought one sps to see how it does if it works out i will probably get more
DIY,not_removed,well done disaster averted
DIY,not_removed,the biggest drawback is that it requires drain holes most reef ready tanks only have the blue lights are the normal spectrum that they get underwater so corals use mainly blue light to grow i personally like a little whiter lighting but it can cause more algae and less coral growth the blues have a lot of uv usually which makes the colors pop more than the white lights do it looks kinda like a black light does with bright colors phone cameras do very poorly with blue lights too so that causes lots of photos to look terrible im sure if you google coral under white vs blue you could see examples
DIY,not_removed,love lps i was too lazy to keep my tank clean enough for sps tried a few and none did too well
DIY,not_removed,nick name is acanbran i frag acans in orlando fl to sell at world wide coral what lights you running
DIY,not_removed,interesting thanks for the info i suspected it was something to do with the growth was not aware it cause more algae also i think you are right phone cameras seem to pick up a ton of uv probably more than is actually visible because in real life i dont notice most reef tanks being super blue just a tad thanks
DIY,not_removed,nice acans are so cool i have truelumen leds on each half two marine fusion and one actinic
DIY,not_removed,very cool jealous of your shop one thing did you glue the entire length of the breadboard or did you account for wood movement in some way
DIY,not_removed,how long did it take you to build it
DIY,not_removed,thank you for sharing
DIY,not_removed,ive been here months looking for ideas on a smaller farm table with benches for my kitchen that i can actually build found it this is beautiful and the work is outstanding looking forward to posting my first diy
DIY,not_removed,that thing is so shiny i could probably slide right across the top if i was butt naked and greased in oil
DIY,not_removed,this is absolutely elegant congrats
DIY,not_removed,what kind of poly did you use exactly this looks awesome by the way edit never mind just checked out the video
DIY,not_removed,thanks for checking it out i did glue the whole breadboard end i dont think thats the right way to do it but i was getting a gap before gluing and clamping it tight
DIY,not_removed,at least weeks working only nights and weekends i work full time as an xray tech
DIY,not_removed,you bet 😁
DIY,not_removed,awesome good luck
DIY,not_removed,its sturdy enoughat the end of the video i sat on it fully clothed though
DIY,not_removed,youre very kind thanks
DIY,not_removed,you may experience some unwanted warpingbuckling in the table top in a few years depending on your climate
DIY,not_removed,you might get lucky but be prepared to revisit those bread board ends
DIY,not_removed,there it is
DIY,not_removed,not gluing the bread board on to let the wood expand and contract
DIY,not_removed,chicken coup the poultry revolution has begun first the shed next the pyramids
DIY,not_removed,have you seen the video of the guy that moved an entire barn by himself with just sticks and stones edit found it
DIY,not_removed,my old boss was remodeling his deck he had a nearly new hot tub on it that he wanted to get rid of he told me i could have it no charge if i could get it off his deck it was the last thing on there before he was going to start the remodel i showed up with two wooden closet dowels that i had cut in half to about inches long a piece my girlfriend and a box truck he didnt understand how we were going to move it i was able to shuffle the tub to the end of the deck so it balanced on the edge put three of the dowels down and started pushing it across his lawn best free hot tub ever
DIY,not_removed,i expected slaves and a whip but that way works too
DIY,not_removed,project is far from finished but i thought you all might like to see how i move the existing shed without any help its base foot print is and i would say its close to tall so its not that big fairly straightforward first i had to jack it up and rip off some of the old pieces of wood creating the base they were rotted out and wouldnt roll very well if i were to try then i replaced them so the bottom was all the same plane next i just put down some ply wood and put down pieces of emt to use as rollers it pushed along quite nicely
DIY,not_removed,fun fact it is now hypothesized that the egyptians moved large stone blocks by pouring water on the sand in front of the block which made the block easier to push creating a hydroplane this is backed by cave paintings from the era im not sure how true this is but it is something i read on ancient aliens or some other reliable source
DIY,not_removed,this is fucking cool
DIY,not_removed,reminded me of the time when i was in a boy scout doing renovation at the campsite and we had to move a tool shed the adults were going to call a company to borrow a forklift but for some reason i just said why just slide it over to the new location of course they thought i was crazy but i clarify them that i meant pushing it across on tent poles since there were like of them i was told to get scouts to try it while the adult and rest of the scout did other renovations it was exactly like how you did it using car jack to lift it up standard ones for spare tires and place poles then sliding it across to new location it only worked because the weather was really nice and the ground was dry when the shed actually began to move smoothly to new location i heard holy shit from adults lol
DIY,not_removed,work like an egyptian
DIY,not_removed,ive been looking for a shed and my plan to move it was to hook the atv winch to it and just drag it wherever i wanted using this method if i have to ended up buying one that needed to be taken apart i was kinda bummed but once its back together i will go back to my dragitwhereiwantit method
DIY,not_removed,i found this post very amusing haha it probably felt pretty awesome getting it where it needed to go with some ingenuity high five
DIY,not_removed,so do you have two sheds
DIY,not_removed,you must be putting switchgear in modular oilfield building or something hello fellow electrician
DIY,not_removed,an gun safe is no match for people armed with foot sections of inch pvc
DIY,not_removed,if you did it by yourself i dont really think that counts as egyptianat least not ancient egyptian
DIY,not_removed,i recall a video years ago where a guy did a similar thing but with his entire house i cant seem to locate the video though
DIY,not_removed,shit works yo
DIY,not_removed,i moved my shed the same way i used pvc pipe
DIY,not_removed,you conduit
DIY,not_removed,thats awesome good shit
DIY,not_removed,my dad and i did that when i was thats awesome
DIY,not_removed,thanks for the inspiration i have a shed ive been thinking about moving but had no idea how to do it
DIY,not_removed,for some reason ride of the valkyries began to play in my head when that bad boy began to roll
DIY,not_removed,you move transformers this way thats ballsy
DIY,not_removed,dude hate to tell you this but your sheds escaping
DIY,not_removed,gotta remove chicken coups before they get out of hand
DIY,not_removed,i moved a giant stone lion the same way but also enlisted the help of a heavily pregnant woman to push
DIY,not_removed,did you get a bunch of jews to move it
DIY,not_removed,i thought you were going to fill your yard with water and use buoyancy to raise your shed
DIY,not_removed,should have added more doors to the coup to make it a sedan
DIY,not_removed,am egyptian can confirm this is how we do it moved pyramids last week with this method
DIY,not_removed,my dad used a jack and woodenpallets to add a loft to his barn he jacked it up add framing set it down and did each side until he was up about ft
DIY,not_removed,one of my favourite books beautifully illustrated with lots of detail
DIY,not_removed,we got a six by eight amish shed the guy moved it easily with four landscape timbers cool
DIY,not_removed,we used the same technique when moving vaults in a graveyard
DIY,not_removed,actually the egyptians used a sleigh and poured water in front of it to reduce the friction in the sand
DIY,not_removed,obviously the aliens moved the shed
DIY,not_removed,nice i had forgotten that the egyptians invented the car jack
DIY,not_removed,this is the best thing ive seen on reddit today i need to move my shed soon and ive been stressing out how to do it properly this is fabulous thank you
DIY,not_removed,could use more pictures im envisioning something like a flipbook maybe next time
DIY,not_removed,ramses xxxx is looking for a project manager
DIY,not_removed,i dont see any aliens
DIY,not_removed,the rapa nui people would be proud
DIY,not_removed,very cool i may try this when planting larger trees in backyards a skid steer cant reach
DIY,not_removed,nice job man i have a large solar air heater that i move in and out of the garage twice a year i use a similar method i put a row of large dowels and cut up broom handles in a row and push it along its actually easier to do it myself rather then have about extra people to actually lift and carry it
DIY,not_removed,great job will keep this in mind if i ever have to move something big
DIY,not_removed,that method works great ive used it many times never have moved anything as big as a shed before though
DIY,not_removed,my dad did that in alaska with our house he jacked up the whole thing and moved it forward it was pretty crazy i need to find the pictures now
DIY,not_removed,nice job just curious is there any evidence that ancient egyptians actually used this technique or is it a common misconception
DIY,not_removed,i was expecting a hebrew wench block
DIY,not_removed,we got four workers from home depot for an hour pushed one side up and slid a under did the same on the opposite side had em lift a shed about the same size as yours and walk it across the yard i was pretty impressed
DIY,not_removed,and are you still intending to purchase this second shed
DIY,not_removed,hey thats how they built stonehenge too good job using good old ancient engineering
DIY,not_removed,man you must have shed some weight moving that alone not what i thought of when hearing polebuilding
DIY,not_removed,why did the shed cross the yard to make the chicken coop
DIY,not_removed,now youre serfing with history
DIY,not_removed,ive done this with some bridgeport mills before
DIY,not_removed,this is how me and my boss moved our ton drill presses across the shop floor its amazing how well it works
DIY,not_removed,its coop but nicely done i am sure that was a hell of a challenge even by doing that
DIY,not_removed,would have made a great stop motion film
DIY,not_removed,thanks have some egyptian gold
DIY,not_removed,as soon as i saw it i knew it was an electrical craft worker its a very easy way to move around electrical cabinets mcc and other heavy equipment nice work with such a large footprint
DIY,not_removed,yknow i was looking at some tuff sheds at home depot last week and i guess someone bought one assembled off the lot and they laid out tree posts and rolled it outta there it was huge too stories maybe ft deep total hoarder shelving setup
DIY,not_removed,awesome work my dad grand father an old neighbor and a few others used this same method to move a car garage to the next property lot over and turned it mid i was too young to remember but there are photos somewhere at my parents house
DIY,not_removed,years ago a guy in a town near mine moved a house from one side of the street to the other that way created a major traffic jam but it worked no idea if it was worth it because he must have received a pretty major fine the local paper referred to it as a flinstoneesque house move
DIY,not_removed,if it starts sliding youve gotta stop it alone
DIY,not_removed,im a big fan of pieces of pipe and a comealong but thatll do pig
DIY,not_removed,sure you didnt get help from aliens
DIY,not_removed,i was expecting chickens wheres the chickens
DIY,not_removed,you use brain power i redneck power a and rope
DIY,not_removed,be honest is it your neighbours shed and have you moved it to mess with them
DIY,not_removed,out in the bush its extreme engineering
DIY,not_removed,edit
DIY,not_removed,or aliens
DIY,not_removed,egyptians did not have any wheels or rollers
DIY,not_removed,cool but the egyptians probably used floats attached to loads and waterways to move heavy loads like blocks used in the construction of teh pyramids
DIY,not_removed,wowthat was super underwhelming i was imagining this plus a variety of other techniques up to and including a pulley but you just did the thing i would do with at least or medicine balls and my body
DIY,not_removed,i hate to tell you man but the egyptians didnt do anything aliens did it for them didnt you go to school
DIY,not_removed,but were you drunk enough to not run away afterwards
DIY,not_removed,checks out
DIY,not_removed,not gonna shit on ya parade since that worked out well but y can also bolt some stub axles to the back and make a young out of next time to be easier
DIY,not_removed,jew slaves not found
DIY,not_removed,you went egyptian on them chickens
DIY,not_removed,you should post your finished pics at rbackyardchickens i put ski like planks on my shedcoop for easy moving in the future
DIY,not_removed,nice you got some ets to help you jealous
DIY,not_removed,i moved one two weeks ago but i cheated and used a bobcat loader haha
DIY,not_removed,cleopatra approves well done
DIY,not_removed,nice ive had to do that myself once or twice using iron window weights to move a giant rabbit hutch which may have been used as a kennel for sheep dogs originally
DIY,not_removed,the best theory is that the egyptians build the pyramids by floating the blocks not rolling them
DIY,not_removed,youve moved it a pharaoh distance
DIY,not_removed,you were trolled by discovery channel everyone knows that egyptians used aliens
DIY,not_removed,dont tell work you can do it by yourself youll suddenly have no help
DIY,not_removed,by egyptian engineering you mean slaves
DIY,not_removed,using some egyptian engineering slavery is frowned upon this day and age
DIY,not_removed,egyptian engineer here nice job
DIY,not_removed,my dad made me do this once when i was only we used pvc pipe and i dont remember having plywood then he made me double the size of his deck all the while he supervised from a lawn chair with a beer in his hand when we were done he paid me and i bought myself a bitchin leather belt that i planned to have for life until last summer when my cousin borrowed it and never brought it back im now and own a landscaping company thanks dad also im a girl
DIY,not_removed,great job phil weve both been channeling the egyptians this week i had to move a x architectural screen in place a few pics httpsimgurcomgalleryudtmd
DIY,not_removed,i was expecting to see slaves
DIY,not_removed,engineering
DIY,not_removed,egyptians used aliens though
DIY,not_removed,cool but the egyptians used a series of canals locks and floating bladders to build the pyramids not the that would take fucking forever method of rolling blocks on logs
DIY,not_removed,how many slaves were crushed in the process
DIY,not_removed,high chances this guy is an electrician
DIY,not_removed,is megatron or optimus prime a heavier transformer
DIY,not_removed,i fully expected there to be a image of the shed disappearing off into the sunset
DIY,not_removed,good move my dad once asked me to move his hot tub with him and i thought he was crazy because it was just me and him he said it would be easy he got out the pipes and it was easy fucking smart man
DIY,not_removed,i thought i was gonna come in here and see a bunch of slaves moving a shed while you whipped them from a shaded area
DIY,not_removed,well played would have been awesome to have a gif can you ive it back and record it also the surrounding area reminds me of my hometown in southern illinois
DIY,not_removed,you essentially made a big ball bearing nice
DIY,not_removed,your ingenuity made my day better
DIY,not_removed,cmon op do you think were stupid you obviously used ancient alien technology
DIY,not_removed,basically how i move giant furniture around the house using broom handles and rags and i also dont have friends op but its ok at least we can move stuff
DIY,not_removed,what kind of sorcere is this
DIY,not_removed,oh man im going to move our garden shed soon and ive been thinking about something similiar except that i first have to detach the shed from the foundation because my retired engineer stepfather insisted it needs to be bolted to a cement foundation so it will last yeah
DIY,not_removed,this is how they moved ships in sweden in like
DIY,not_removed,if this were a government job it wouldve taken guys bobcats a truck and weeks
DIY,not_removed,bonus points for no slaves 💯
DIY,not_removed,aww i was hoping to see you whipping a bunch of slaves but this is cool too i guess
DIY,not_removed,aliens
DIY,not_removed,by egyptian engineering you mean aliens right
DIY,not_removed,wow you really got things rolling eh
DIY,not_removed,what type of work are you in
DIY,not_removed,did you have an issue with the pipes wanting to slide around on their own and not roll correctly
DIY,not_removed,this is how i moved our my shed by myself using some egyptian engineering
DIY,not_removed,your bosses are really nice letting you take home all that emt and strut
DIY,not_removed,moving transformers electrician
DIY,not_removed,aliens built the shed
DIY,not_removed,why not use a forklift or palletjack at work is your company too cheap to buy them and would rather buy a bunch of pipes and plywood
DIY,not_removed,used these method to put a platoon boat in and out of the water springfall at my grandparents cottage growing up lol nice job
DIY,not_removed,i had to use this method to move one of those year old power hammers back when i was a blacksmith a picture of something that is the same type as the one i moved or very close to it i am shocked at how well this method works at moving huge things but be very careful on slopes since its so efficient at reducing that good ol static coefficient
DIY,not_removed,aliens
DIY,not_removed,cant watch at work just assume op used vegan graviton lifts or pomiran mass relativity like the egyptians or maya
DIY,not_removed,yeah ive done this a bunch of times ive moved sheds that size with pvc pipes with just me and another guy you dont even need the plywood underneath believe it or not
DIY,not_removed,gotta be really careful with slopes though
DIY,not_removed,hey thats how the move the space shuttle
DIY,not_removed,everyone knows that in egypt it was aliens
DIY,not_removed,you could have just lifted it
DIY,not_removed,ah the old egyptian swivel eh nice job
DIY,not_removed,im confused where are all the slaves
DIY,not_removed,can i marry you
DIY,not_removed,well obviously you couldnt have done thisaliens helped
DIY,not_removed,as an ancient egyptian i actually prefer the use of elephants over this technique one elephant is capable of pulling with the force of over men
DIY,not_removed,til while showing this to my coworker that its pronounced chicken coo forgive me ive never used the term chicken coup in my lufe
DIY,not_removed,nice job as a note this roller technique was practiced long before the egyptians here is an example in httpsenmwikipediaorgwikitumulusofbougon where a tomb was closed with a slab carved from a quarry away that was about years ago
DIY,not_removed,and they always ask how were the pyramids built like come on guys egyptian engineering
DIY,not_removed,so you had aliens help you
DIY,not_removed,we moved our ton lathe a similar way we could use our forklift to get into the shipping container that we use as a machine shop but once it got into the door we used solid steel bars to roll it around the shop we also moved our ton bandsaw the same way its surprisingly easy to move heavy tools around like that
DIY,not_removed,seems like using that many rollers would make this harder
DIY,not_removed,this is how they did stonehenge
DIY,not_removed,when i was a thirteen my father and i moved pieces of printing equipment each weighing a minimum of tons with the largest well over tons uphill up a gravel road for miles we had to take them off of a trailer first that was the hardest part we went through a doorway that had less than an inch clearance on either side maneuvered them precisely amongst other equipment into their spots it took us about hours for all working steadily to accomplish at the beginning of the day i thought we were screwed at the end i was in awe we used your methods wood pipes and a hammer for stakes also a bit of rope years later after he passed away i did it again in reverse by myself i rarely impress my wife but she was awestruck at the end of that day she still talks about it years later when people talk about how the pyramids were built i bloody well know how the pyramids were built with a little bit of ingenuity some sweat and persistence also a bit of rope
DIY,not_removed,great job how hard was it making the turn also what thickness was the osb
DIY,not_removed,i was sure it would just be picture upon picture of expendable slave labor
DIY,not_removed,cool
DIY,not_removed,you move transformers at work cant they move on their own or are they sleepingdead
DIY,not_removed,nicely done i had to do something similar when our neighbor decided to tell us that building codes didnt allow it that close to his garage of course he waited until it was done to tell us that we had to move it three feet
DIY,not_removed,this is so rad great job
DIY,not_removed,looks like you went shedding
DIY,not_removed,yep maid the same with my neighbor barn at night now i have barn
DIY,not_removed,precision egyptian engineering
DIY,not_removed,man i wish i could get aliens to do my yard work
DIY,not_removed,im pretty sure you got help from aliens to do this still not convinced
DIY,not_removed,i did the same thing a couple of years ago my dumb neighbor thought i was a genius
DIY,not_removed,they had whips rimmer massive massive whips
DIY,not_removed,my favourite theory on how the pyramids were built is the water theory hes probably wrong about several things but the principle seems effective and far more efficient than the idea of thousands of slaves pulling stones around with rope
DIY,not_removed,wheres the foreman s
DIY,not_removed,where are the aliens
DIY,not_removed,i plan on using the same engineering to move a lbs inboard sailboat engine out of its mounting i am exciting edit i stand by the accidental wording of my second sentence
DIY,not_removed,cluckhotep ii will be very pleased
DIY,not_removed,this would have made a neat time lapse
DIY,not_removed,pennsylvania
DIY,not_removed,clearly aliens no man could do this alone
DIY,not_removed,bruh genius
DIY,not_removed,i work for the fire department and a large part of my wheelhouse is technical rescue including structural collapse rescue this is how we move multi ton blocks of concrete and steel without any machinery just pry bars and rollers it works really well as long as you dont lose control of what youre moving
DIY,not_removed,eh i prolly woulda used my pickup truck and some straps but i commend you for the badass idea i have seen this method on tv before pretty nice
DIY,not_removed,for that amount of effort you could have just bolted on wheels and pulled it with a car heck you could have just rounded the fronts nailed some metal flashing on and pulled it like a sled
DIY,not_removed,love it had to do this with a massive dog house before my family was made cause they said i should have waited for help um i lifted it inches off the ground required very little muscle or effort good job
DIY,not_removed,i did the exact same thing to get my shed from my front yard to my backyard except we used round fence posts it worked well to move an with people
DIY,not_removed,very sheddy idea
DIY,not_removed,came here expecting aliens
DIY,not_removed,aliens
DIY,not_removed,nice job would have been cool to see a time lapse of this
DIY,not_removed,you used aliens
DIY,not_removed,needs more gif of stopmotion shed moving across the yard
DIY,not_removed,i had to move a heavy raised garden solo recently and i assembled two of to a and turned it into a mobile second class lever i fully intended to return my wheels once i was complete but not only did i keep them ive kept my whole apparatus in tact for future use so very handy
DIY,not_removed,if i have a tough task in front of me that involves anything large or heavy i ask myself how would the egyptians do it if its something that requires significant risk or doing it multiple times i call the specialists but yeah moving transformers is a pain
DIY,not_removed,reminds me of this guy
DIY,not_removed,ever seen the movie frailty
DIY,not_removed,slavery gets shit done source am jewish
DIY,not_removed,watched my dad do this with a ft cabin and old utility poles about years ago when he sold the cabin to the neighbour and wanted it off his back lot
DIY,not_removed,where there is knowledge there is a way nicely done and relatively inexpensive
DIY,not_removed,thats really cool congratulations dude
DIY,not_removed,we all know egyptians were helped by aliens or god himself
DIY,not_removed,why didnt you use skate boards or roller skates
DIY,not_removed,what an acheivment well done you deserve a cold
DIY,not_removed,somehow the egyptians managed to put the speed of light the circumference of the earth and sun line the great pyramid up almost perfectly with magnetic north and make the face of the inner chamber stone smooth to a degree of of an inch only using hemp ropes and copper chisels bullshit
DIY,not_removed,up vote for tittle alone
DIY,not_removed,i would have used a comealong
DIY,not_removed,egyptian engineering so aliens right
DIY,not_removed,did this same thing with an shed last summer using sections of pvc pipe the larger pipe allowed us to move across the ground without plywood and also to pivot the shed for turning corners nice job op
DIY,not_removed,im planning to do something similar to a shed in the next couple of weeks i only want to move it metres though i had read online to use pvc down pipes do you think these steel pipes are a better option
DIY,not_removed,well done
DIY,not_removed,why is there a forklift in the background then
DIY,not_removed,nice work but if he had a couple friends
DIY,not_removed,i was expecting woolley mammoths
DIY,not_removed,by ancient egyptian engineering i assumed you meant slavery
DIY,not_removed,the egyptians didnt use wheels and probably didnt knew of them
DIY,not_removed,nice way to move your shed however i dont think that there is any evidence that the egyptians used rollers to move large blocks current thinking is that they just used water as a lubricant and lots of workers to pull them
DIY,not_removed,the order was given to turn cows to whoppers enforced by the might of ten thousand coppers but on the horizon surrounding the shoppers came the deafening roar of
DIY,not_removed,all animals are equal but some animals are more equal than others
DIY,not_removed,his chickens are revolting
DIY,not_removed,watch out for gorilla warfare op
DIY,not_removed,four legs good two legs bad
DIY,not_removed,no this is obviously a chicken coupe out for a spin if it had four doors it would be a chicken sedan
DIY,not_removed,this guy sphinx hes clever
DIY,not_removed,ok that is really cool the whole video but how the fuck would he get the horizontal block of the arches on top
DIY,not_removed,this needs to be upvoted higher its a pretty underrated video thats been online for a while a friend showed it to me in college and when i saw this dude start scaling things up and is moving sheds and barns my mind was blown pretty ingenious
DIY,not_removed,always reminds me
DIY,not_removed,anybody else realize his name is wally wallington and hes moving walls
DIY,not_removed,i heard those break bones
DIY,not_removed,wow
DIY,not_removed,does this attempt to answer how stonehenge was formed or simply shed a bit of light cause i dont see his principles carrying over into a smooth damp plain
DIY,not_removed,thats really cool thanks
DIY,not_removed,he never really shows how he gets those blocks onto those rocks which is the real trick
DIY,not_removed,how does he get the stones underneath the blocks in the first place
DIY,not_removed,is there a follow up did he finish it
DIY,not_removed,did he break his bones
DIY,not_removed,because i just watched the australian flood video i read that first sentence with an australian accent in my head my first language isnt english needless to say i didnt read the rest of your comment because of my childish bemusement edit read the rest still funny and a good story too upvote
DIY,not_removed,ancient egyptians didnt use slave for construction common misconception
DIY,not_removed,he tried that already now he has a chicken coup on his hands
DIY,not_removed,i expected space ships
DIY,not_removed,hey great that it worked but try to keep in mind that jacks are for lifting not support big heavy objects that are precariously balanced are not the best thing to be working under also you mentioned that you were working alone im glad i got to read this in rdiy and not rtifu
DIY,not_removed,have you seen this
DIY,not_removed,nice job i used a combination of simple levers and rollers to move a lb safe from the end of my driveway to the back of my garage it took some planning and thinking but it was totally worth is just to be able to tell my buddies that i moved it by myself
DIY,not_removed,neat i did this with some we had to use a comealong to get the rocks started onto the pipe
DIY,not_removed,theres also speculation that they tied floats to the stone blocks and literally floated them along in a canal
DIY,not_removed,theres video of people doing this online sand thats just wet enough is almost as low friction as rollers and they arent cave paintings
DIY,not_removed,how would they get the water there without a hose fake story
DIY,not_removed,my only doubt here is that the logistics involved to get sand that wet in an arid climate would be difficult also your talking about saturating the sand with water and thats going to take a lot of water because water disapates in sandy soils fast probably so much water that itll weigh more than the blocks themselves also costing more labour and energy seems to me the most logically method is just rollers for land horizontal travel although i think people tend to forget that pyramids were built over a long time span and its possible different pyramids were built using different methods due to changes in technology and inventing better methods i think its pretty much a given that over the span of generations and generations that the methods would be improved also location of quarry to pyramid would be a factor in what methods are used some might use the nile river and some completely over land
DIY,not_removed,ancient aliens reliable source pick one
DIY,not_removed,thanks
DIY,not_removed,i hope you got a merit badge out of that
DIY,not_removed,ay oh whey oh ay oh whey oh
DIY,not_removed,if you reinforce the bottom of it like a sledge you wont need rollers
DIY,not_removed,it felt great once i got it moving it took a while to jack it up and repair the bottom got home at and stopped working around so i wasnt working on it that long
DIY,not_removed,the other one is more of a work shop but i guess its small enough to be called a shed
DIY,not_removed,hellz yeah
DIY,not_removed,for armed people with feet
DIY,not_removed,well it was the engineering idea not the exact method i suppose
DIY,not_removed,thanks
DIY,not_removed,how did phillbotwankchamp get that shed from you guys
DIY,not_removed,when the pallet they come on doesnt fit though the door its about the easiest way plus you always have scraps of pipe to do it
DIY,not_removed,for you maybe but hes more than meets the eye
DIY,not_removed,so your dad had lofty goals
DIY,not_removed,i agree well done
DIY,not_removed,thanks
DIY,not_removed,need to get ahold of that guy who had darth vader and spiderman put the wood up in his garage
DIY,not_removed,dang it that would have been awesome
DIY,not_removed,or some stop motion of pushing the shed then moving pipe pushing shed moving plywood then benny hill chasing some girls
DIY,not_removed,xl is
DIY,not_removed,im fairly sure the egyptians just used a bunch of slaves to move their chicken coops
DIY,not_removed,dug a hole under the middle support of one side big enough to get a jack under shimmed that side up then did the same on the opposite side you can see the jack still installed in the first pic
DIY,not_removed,no eventually we will build a garage with an upstairs apartment but that will be about years out depending on our financial status
DIY,not_removed,i visited there a little over a year ago and it was one of the most fascinating things ive seen its funny how we take for granted the power tools and vehicles we use in construction today
DIY,not_removed,ha classic
DIY,not_removed,they are just little chicks now small enough to be in a small pin in our garage they are growing fast though and im running out of time to finish my project haha
DIY,not_removed,so what youre saying is he should have built a canal in his yard to move the shed because i agree that would have been way more awesome
DIY,not_removed,i dont understand where are the ufos
DIY,not_removed,looks great
DIY,not_removed,you got it boss
DIY,not_removed,i wish that would have been a quick project if i had their help
DIY,not_removed,ancient astronaut theorists believe
DIY,not_removed,im not saying it was aliens but it was aliens
DIY,not_removed,commercial industrial electrician
DIY,not_removed,yes a bit only because every time i advanced the next piece of ply wood i would angle it off to the side instead of putting it down straight on because i needed to gradually turn the shed bit just move it in a straight line it wasnt too bad though
DIY,not_removed,my wife owns it too i guess i didnt want to exclude her
DIY,not_removed,im the boss and i didnt use any strut👍
DIY,not_removed,yes sir
DIY,not_removed,this is at my home i didnt want to drive a forklift though my grass and tear it all up and as for the pallet jack the base footprint of this is i was worried about it losing balance while i was pulling it and tipping over this method only took me and a half hours or so im sure there are far better ways to do it but this way seemed to be just fine im bringing all the material back to the job site when im done with it so that pipe will be full of wire in some building
DIY,not_removed,they had math and im sure some poor bastard had the job of guarding the datum points used they had copper actually copper alloy a lot of the ore contained materials that made their copper last longer without wok hardening also they used sand to cut and bore stone with copper tools they had loadstones so were familiar with magments you can polish stone with tools and sand as the abrasive they cheated finishingsmonuments were done to a high degree general stone work is square but not pretty hemp rope rubble and a heavy stone to move up they build elevators and used counterweights
DIY,not_removed,i dont believe there is any evidence the egyptians had concrete the blocks are quarried sandstone and archaeologists believe they know which quarry based on chemical analysis
DIY,not_removed,really water isnt a very good lubricant
DIY,not_removed,both methods are equally valid since neither has hard proof yet
DIY,not_removed,you deserve way more upvotes for this we are free roving bovines we run free today
DIY,not_removed,that is a beautiful video
DIY,not_removed,this made my soul happy haha
DIY,not_removed,i read this in vinnie pazs rap voice
DIY,not_removed,thank you for reminding me of this
DIY,not_removed,mister tweedy
DIY,not_removed,its the chicken spring
DIY,not_removed,finally something we agree on
DIY,not_removed,a chicken saloon
DIY,not_removed,im not choking around
DIY,not_removed,i would imagine that he would move the top block alongside the two standing blocks then teetertotter it to the right heighth using the added planks and then add rocks between the block and the planks to give him the ability to swivel the block on top of the standing ones
DIY,not_removed,youre way ahead of me im here wondering how you get a tiny rock under a ton brick
DIY,not_removed,
DIY,not_removed,creates a stair step to role the blocks up a long incline
DIY,not_removed,i get the two stones method but how do you get the stones under the barn or rectangle blocks
DIY,not_removed,this is the stonehenge song you link to
DIY,not_removed,thank you for this
DIY,not_removed,i didnt realize they were a comedy band
DIY,not_removed,i did think that it was kind of completely unnecessary
DIY,not_removed,to be fair it doesnt seem like this wally fellow is the one emphasizing that he is a white man
DIY,not_removed,i was puzzled as to why that mattered at all is it more or less impressive that it was a white guy
DIY,not_removed,just one white man
DIY,not_removed,eh they do it with every other race so i dont see the big deal here young black girl invents indian boy does muslim girl donates
DIY,not_removed,wally wellingtons wonder walls
DIY,not_removed,just need wider supports surface area is king
DIY,not_removed,you saw his linear verticallift method so he just does that next to his two piers then once its at height slide onto the top of the piers
DIY,not_removed,australians wouldnt pronounce deck like dick if thats what youre thinking a new zealander would though source am australian
DIY,not_removed,they used aliens duh
DIY,not_removed,they didnt use slaves to construct the pyramids they most definitely had slaves though the pyramid builders usly came from lower class families but were respected for work they did so much so that if they died on the job they got buried in a burial site next to the pharoahs
DIY,not_removed,true we also dont know if they even used rollers nobody has found clearcut examples of the rollers or any descriptions of rollers being used herodotus mentions machines made of small wood planks in recent years its been demonstrated that a couple people can easily move enormous concrete blocks by balancing one end on a small pivot and swinging the block around onto another pivot walking it along but what the egyptians actually did is still pure conjecture
DIY,not_removed,its amazing reading all the replies to this comment some making polar opposite points but all presenting information as fact even the ones that are clearly opinion
DIY,not_removed,a brain surgeon once said the pyramids were giant granaries
DIY,not_removed,actually thats the common misconception there were quiet a few slaves used but the majority of workers were contracted by an engineer overlord type of scenario plus slave in ancient egypt at the time of the great pyramids isnt exactly what we call slaves today or our understanding of it most scholars compared it to indentured servitude by tribe or nation military pressure would force entire groups into work for an extended period of time
DIY,not_removed,check me on this but as the pyramids were considered holy objects slaves werent even allowed to touch them were they
DIY,not_removed,not a common misconception otherwise it would be listed on wikipedias common misconception page
DIY,not_removed,tell me more because ive always heard of them having slaves
DIY,not_removed,i dunno the whole whipping part of the process
DIY,not_removed,dont worry i do this quite often at work i was using ton rated jack stands and cinder blocks to use as a fall safe also my pregnant wife came out from time to time to check progress i only mention she is pregnant so you understand why i didnt want her helping me haha
DIY,not_removed,i havent that was really cool thanks for sharing makes me look like a wimp compared to that dude haha
DIY,not_removed,exactly thats half the fun being able to do it without help
DIY,not_removed,nope
DIY,not_removed,whyd the egyptians only use man power no work animals like horses or buffalo or camels
DIY,not_removed,the nile
DIY,not_removed,i mean considering the amount of water you would need and the how much water weighs thats a pretty valid question to ask keep in mind that this is sandy soils and arid climate using water as a tool for anything probably isnt going to be easy
DIY,not_removed,it really seems like a pretty good way to do it without heavy machinery too honestly i would have never thought to do this it makes a lot of sense how hard was it even with the rollers and plywood im sure the plywood flexed a bit and did weird shit so im sure it wasnt totally efficient considering you did it alone thats pretty impressive
DIY,not_removed,nah lol but i did get to spend on food for the rest of the scouts got wish list of snacks and an adult drove us to local walmart normally we werent allowed soda but that day was an exception worth of chips and sodas are quiet a lot
DIY,not_removed,wet the grass too itll slide along nicely
DIY,not_removed,thats pretty amazing did it take longer to jack it up and repair it then to move it
DIY,not_removed,and do your friends call you two sheds jackson
DIY,not_removed,i knew when he said transformers because thats how we piece together modular switch gear into the mcc building the crane can only get it in the door so from there we take ft chunks of rigid steel pipe and slowly roll the gear while the apprentices take the pipes from the back and move them to the front
DIY,not_removed,ya i agree with the pp could have used alot more jew slaves i suppose those are hard to come by these days though
DIY,not_removed,yes sir can confirm also any big switchgear and associated cabinets and such
DIY,not_removed,i see what you did there kid tested mother disapproved
DIY,not_removed,i moved a shed using ancient egyptian technology now let me show you how i did it using technology
DIY,not_removed,only sh
DIY,not_removed,oh nice i was wondering how you got it on top of the rods
DIY,not_removed,yes make yourself scarce two sheds
DIY,not_removed,exactly
DIY,not_removed,then he can turn the canal into a moatwith a drawbridge
DIY,not_removed,well either way cool idea and nice job
DIY,not_removed,it appeared as if it was a man cave moving further away from civilization
DIY,not_removed,youre the owner of the business i assumed you were an employee what with all your moving transformers around ive never seen an owner involved in moving a transformer around on rollers the strut is in the background
DIY,not_removed,cool hey there brother see you around on relectricians very impressive that you basically moved a building by yourself i like how you added the rails on the bottom and leveled it i feel like that was a key step in making it easier no
DIY,not_removed,i get that but the way you said it it sounded like you used this same method at work to move transformers
DIY,not_removed,believe me ive heard all the explanations as to how they accomplished this feat with stone age tech the only thing that the egyptian authority refuses to touch on is how the egyptians had the knowledge of pi the speed of light the circumference of both earth and sun how they lined it up with magnetic north and gave it yes sides to signal the equinox the legendary record keeping of the egyptians doesnt record knowledge of any of these things and they dont even mention how the greatest feat they ever accomplished was carried out its sketchy to me that only one egyptian authority is allowed to study and release findings on the pyramids
DIY,not_removed,i think they believe most material transports were done by building wooden discs around the stone and rolling them from the quary to the pyramids water wouldnt have reduced the friction enough for workers to push many of the blocks
DIY,not_removed,ive read that they may have used water and clay to make a slip applied to the stone and the surface you want to move it across making it relatively easy to move heavy objects then again the amount needed to move the stones necessary to build the pyramids of giza and the ramps necessary to elevate them are technically achievable but in practice its pretty friggin impractical
DIY,not_removed,cows with guns taking over but it wont be long theyre pasteurized cattle tons cows with guns cows with guns easy does it easy does it they got something to say moo to
DIY,not_removed,or you could raise the top block up first then place the supports like in the video with just enough room to clear the top block then do the teeter process in reverse removing supports until you cant remove anymore the supports might still kind of be stuck from weight pressure so you can just burn them when youre done
DIY,not_removed,heighth hythe
DIY,not_removed,oh im also stuck on this i feel like he must have cheated for this part but would love to know otherwise
DIY,not_removed,probably closer to tons you could always dig under the stone build your fulcrum then excavate the earth around it enough to begin rocking
DIY,not_removed,you pour the concrete on top of the rocks
DIY,not_removed,im assuming he uses that really big ass leverhandle to pop it up just a little bit and someone else gets the stone under there
DIY,not_removed,hi im wally wallington of wally wallingtons wonder wall emporium and due to a shipping error im currently overstocked on wonder walls
DIY,not_removed,my girlfriend asked me if i was ever going to stop singing wonderwall i said maybe
DIY,not_removed,oh shit im sorry haha i know the difference is big ive just been in contact with kiwis a lot more than aussies which probably explains my messup wouldnt want to be confused with the germans or belgians myself but its still hard to discern for me honestly having the money to visit both nations one day would help thanks for the correction maat dutch for mate
DIY,not_removed,
DIY,not_removed,im not saying it was aliens buuutttt it was aliens
DIY,not_removed,they were probably illegal too 😒
DIY,not_removed,ancient astronaut theorist say yes which is basically dudes sitting in a room
DIY,not_removed,predators taught them
DIY,not_removed,if they died on the job they got buried in a burial site next to the pharoahs while this does sound like a great honour the cynic in me just keeps thinking that this way they didnt need to be carried that far
DIY,not_removed,i read they were buried around the pyramids and some even volunteered to work on the pyramids so yeah big misconception that primarily slaves were used
DIY,not_removed,were do you find they had slaves i mean archaeologically proven
DIY,not_removed,ah the old walkin the fridge move
DIY,not_removed,dont they have images of sleds possibly with water being poured to reduce friction
DIY,not_removed,that would be a rather odd and inefficient though quite fortified design for a granary
DIY,not_removed,was it ben carson that sounds like something hed say
DIY,not_removed,oh they had slaves for sure but they were for helping around the house and such not for major building projects
DIY,not_removed,i took an art history class and there was something about the leader wanting to show the wealth and power of his rule through monuments and the people also benefitting through the reputation and amazingness of those monuments so the people that built them were not slaves yeah i learned fuck all in that class
DIY,not_removed,never happened the misraim in the bible and koran was mistranslated into egypt archaeology never found any of that in egypt nor did archaeology find that egyptian kings were called pharaohs again this comes from mistranslating the biblical and koranic term pharaoh to mean king of egypt which is incorrect
DIY,not_removed,not sure why youd its not like theyre mcdonalds or something
DIY,not_removed,cool secondary supports certainly address the problem i was just imagining something hitting the jack as you were pulling rotted wood out from under the shed which could be unpleasant
DIY,not_removed,did you have to use mechanical advantage to get her out or can she still move under her own power
DIY,not_removed,he actually lives in my state somewhat close relatively speaking id like to meet him one day i cant take full credit for the share tho stole it from the comments lol
DIY,not_removed,id guess because they had way more workers a lot of the people that built the pyramids were not slaves than work animals
DIY,not_removed,thanks it wasnt that hard honestly the only weird part was getting it to turn if i were moving it in a straight line it would have been a lot easier im tall and and i wast sore the next day or anything if that gives you any bearing on how easy it was i just tied to keep at least rollers under it at any given time and didnt have any problems sometimes it wouldnt get started on a new pipe so i would just shove a under it and use that as a leaver to pick it up just enough to kick the next pipe under it its amazing what you can do with simple machines
DIY,not_removed,yes once it got moving it went pretty quick it was just a matter of moving the ply wood and the pipe since i only took two sheets from work and only about sticks of pipe if i had more material it would have been a bit faster
DIY,not_removed,nope they call him phill the wank champ
DIY,not_removed,
DIY,not_removed,fellow electrician can confirm rigid rollers long pry bars chain falls etc have helped me move up to lb switchgear
DIY,not_removed,even better get stone tablets and carve pictures into them like the ancient egyptians did then set them up like dominos to make the flip book effect
DIY,not_removed,here i am in the future thinking the shed across the yard
DIY,not_removed,ill pay for the handling but not the shipping just fondle it a bit and then put it back on the shelf
DIY,not_removed,well when i had it jacked up in the air i slid the ply wood under it then i put the pipe under it and then just lowered it down on top of the pipe
DIY,not_removed,awesome i havent seen that one
DIY,not_removed,yeah strut was left there by the guy i bought the house from he was a wood worker and i assume it was some jig he came up with but who knows as far as the boss im only the job site forman so i dont mind if i take my pipe as long as i bring it back and put it in some walls and fill it up with wire im actually using some of it today to pipe to a ups system im not one to waste material
DIY,not_removed,ive never been over to relectricians i will have to go check it out i posted one of my pipe racks on rconduitporn once i guess thats the only work related subreddit ive been on yes adding the new wood on the bottom was definitely key in making it easier
DIY,not_removed,some times the pallet they come on doesnt fit though doors so thats when we would have to use this method
DIY,not_removed,egypt is a chaotic place but they can always count on people who love the pyrimids to bring tourist money in so they keep the woofactor high and tightly control the flow of info it makes the people money as far as id gamble on unexpected knowledge in ancient times it that there have been civilisations human civilisations on earth that have reached higher maths and astronomy but were erased via a catastrophe to the point a handful of survivors carried some knowledge forward which i honestly find more awe inspiring than spooky ideas maybe there has been an industrial revolution before but we lost it sometime in the last years
DIY,not_removed,theyre turning us into burgers
DIY,not_removed,i am enjoying the new gorillaz song
DIY,not_removed,guns dont kill people cows with guns kill people
DIY,not_removed,or bury the vertical blocks with a hill teeter the horizontal block up there then dig the hill back out
DIY,not_removed,breaking would be better they had crude axes back in the day and could cut them up while in place to take them out then the material is usable in the center to teeter more blocks up
DIY,not_removed,dont let things like this rile you up it really doesnt matter and its really not saying anything youre letting a really minuscule thing have way too much of an effect on your perception of things youve already mentioned how you label someone racist because of it thats overboard
DIY,not_removed,no worries knowing that new zealand even exists means that youre already ahead of the game
DIY,not_removed,so pyramids aliens triangles shed illuminati confirmed
DIY,not_removed,httpiimgurcomllxcowmjpg
DIY,not_removed,butt aliens are the worst
DIY,not_removed,no they were legal aliens englishmen in new york
DIY,not_removed,no wonder their empire fell they decided to build pyramids instead of a wall
DIY,not_removed,considering that its a civilization which transported stones and material to build gigantic pyramids in the middle of the desert just to serve as burial chambers a work which was absolutely massive in scale for its time i highly doubt theyd be unwilling to transport corpses away from a sacred ground
DIY,not_removed,orientation day and if you die on the job you get buried right next to your pharaoh points at large hole in the ground half filled with partially decomposed bodies
DIY,not_removed,if you spent your life working on one of the great cathedrals in europe you might be happy to be buried on sacred grounds of the church
DIY,not_removed,someone who doesnt care to carry you away too far would definitely not build a burial site for you in a sacred place
DIY,not_removed,masons carpenters farmers when farming is out of season would all get good jobs working on pyramids
DIY,not_removed,bbbbut moses
DIY,not_removed,good thing i have a running fridge
DIY,not_removed,not that i know of if we had images like that it wouldnt be a mystery to me the pivoting block approach seems like the most feasible one proposed so far other methods always involve huge numbers of people pushing and pulling which would be a problem when they got to turning a corner
DIY,not_removed,sadly
DIY,not_removed,indeed slaves had to work on everything because of obvious reason but they werent the only workforce for construction the pharaoh were the image of ra on earth or choosen by gods therefore in belief the people are all in his subject doing pharaohs demand was a way of showing respect to both him and gods above this was mostly same for other nations in ancient era the misconception mostly came from tales of old there were good pharaoh who treated his people nicely for their works but also bad one who saw everyone no more than slave in his eyes when people is treated badly sure they will not talk good about you
DIY,not_removed,source more info pleaseee
DIY,not_removed,what pharaoh is derived from pre which means great house and was used initially to describe the entirety of the royal government but it was absolutely used to refer to the king himself starting in the second intermediate period
DIY,not_removed,pharaoh absolutely was used to describe the king himself as a matter of fact nothing in this entire paragraph is widely supported
DIY,not_removed,
DIY,not_removed,ok thats enough reddit for tonight
DIY,not_removed,my life is a lie nothing is true
DIY,not_removed,shes weeks preggers now so she didnt require and rigging shes walking around just fine on her own
DIY,not_removed,thats seriously awesome was your inspiration for this method egyptian engineering or did you find something else along the way
DIY,not_removed,oh ya we also get a scrap piece of lumber and a sledge hammer put the wood against the bottom of the switch gear and hammer away those few extra inches after we take the rollers out
DIY,not_removed,lol the strut just happened to be there you didnt take it from work and the emt you did take it from work but you are going to bring the little foot sections back and reuse them
DIY,not_removed,yeah relectricians is a nice little community its cool to go on there and see and read about what goes on in all the other areas of our trade also a great place for advice if youre ever doing something outside of what youre used to doing i just found your post on rconduitporn in your post history im severely impressed im not on commercial sites often so i only bend pipe enough to know that it is an art and that i need practice haha got any quick simple tips for a beginning bender whats your preferred levelprotractor brand
DIY,not_removed,thats what im getting at an advanced worldwide civilization that was wiped out by some catastrophe there are even some diagrams that show with the right chemicals and compounds the chambers and tunnels couldve been used as reaction chambers to produce hydrogen based nuclear energy
DIY,not_removed,new zealand is too nice a country to have wasted it on kiwis though
DIY,not_removed,what the fuck is new zealand i think im out of the loop on this one
DIY,not_removed,actually the pyramids were landing places for their spaceships
DIY,not_removed,apparently in that time the area was quite lush not a desert one of my dreams is to be able to travel back and see it
DIY,not_removed,well im not sure about the other pyramids but the pyramids of giza were made from stone quarried on site so there wasnt exactly a really long distance to transport them
DIY,not_removed,they werent tombs there is a lot of evidence that they were hydrogen powered generators
DIY,not_removed,where can i get more info about the
DIY,not_removed,that is definitely true at least if my imagination is correct
DIY,not_removed,kind of how the us has used the military to create jobs 🤔
DIY,not_removed,there is no archæological evidence of a mass migration as depicted in exodus neither for that matter that israelites ever lived in ancient egypt
DIY,not_removed,fiction
DIY,not_removed,didnt even build the pyramids in the bible
DIY,not_removed,selfpublished antijewish kindle ebook thinks the world is run by secret reptillians gee sounds like a pol member
DIY,not_removed,more like ssssssssoothsssssayer
DIY,not_removed,yeah that would have been a bit faster for sure this was all free material i just borrowed from work i wanted to do it as cheaply as possible
DIY,not_removed,they are sections and yes absolutely i will use them what would you expect me to do throw them away
DIY,not_removed,thanks that one was quite the project it just takes time to get to that point honestly ive only been bending pipe for years or sothe level i use is some no name brand but it works great and any good level with a degree and degree indicator will work for you just fine
DIY,not_removed,shouldnt be a distraction it really doesnt matter you shouldnt let something do miniscule have such a large effect on your perceptions and labels of other people youre reaction is overboard
DIY,not_removed,i dont believe you ive seen that plot in a movie called wormhole xtreme
DIY,not_removed,look like a pretty uncomfortable landing
DIY,not_removed,why would joseph store grain in a landing zone
DIY,not_removed,i love how you just casually dropped the time travel tourism will exist in my lifetime reminds me of myself as a teenager thinking about space which is looking pretty plausible now
DIY,not_removed,oh then the documentary i saw long ago was propably wrong or about some other egyptian thing actually i cant quite remember
DIY,not_removed,i would like to see some of that evidence please just out of curiosity not as a challenge
DIY,not_removed,a nice pun this one made me exhale a little faster almost a chuckle thanks
DIY,not_removed,we provide afterlife contribution matching up to of annual income
DIY,not_removed,we provide afterlife contribution matching up to of annual income
DIY,not_removed,there is almost no archaeological evidence that the ancient egyptians ever lost at anything the reason for this is that they regularly destroyed evidence of defeat and shame see hatshepsut
DIY,not_removed,gotcha yeah bending seems to be one of those things you just have to do a lot to be good at good talking to you sparky have fun out there
DIY,not_removed,dont forget about the element
DIY,not_removed,deleted
DIY,not_removed,one of the more positive aspects of generational gaps is the idea of the future for me i have no clue what to imagine in the future although what iron man had imagined in was pretty cool but for my mother a gen xer her idea of the future was flying cars and when they announced them she waa completely giddy its just like the jetsons she said but dont let me distract you with stories about my mom
DIY,not_removed,huh til i always thought it had to be transported using barges on the nile because the rock quality wasnt too good onsite i must have watch the same doc as you
DIY,not_removed,ah fair enough i guess subliminally i was in too much of a hurry to make it politically critical so a new deal kind of thing at least that unilaterally positive view of the nd was how i was taught in highschool
DIY,not_removed,you cant regard absence of evidence as evidence if you want to keep yourself to science also a migration of that many people would have left some evidence either in egypt or out of it
DIY,not_removed,there is no archaeological evidence for the exodus none httprationalwikiorgwikievidencefortheexodus
DIY,not_removed,absolutely i saw a study once that showed generational gaps are how real social change happens too and that were more or less born with an envelope of what we are willing to believe im sure ive butchered it in my recollection though total aside your name reminded me of this so i googled the musician and realized they are playing in my neighbourhood in just days so now i have tuesday plans thanks
DIY,not_removed,as far as i know all the limestone for the pyramids came from the onsite quarry but they also incorporated some granite which would have to have been transported there by some means likely a boat
DIY,not_removed,i didnt do that you did you implied that they were not there because there was no egyptian record of the matter thats the definition of taking the absence of evidence as evidence of your claim regardless there is some evidence as the record of the israelites time in egypt in the jewish historical writings even if its not corroborated by egyptian archaeology
DIY,not_removed,dude theyre way fucking cooler than the song that inspired my username thank you for the sick new tunes
DIY,not_removed,no i said there was no evidence of it i didnt say it never happened jesus no pun intended whats so special about this subject that people immediately cease to know how to read and immediately go to attack mode im not interested in your doubts bring me some hard peerreviewed evidence or dont bother replying
DIY,not_removed,that is a better option than what i thought i would see
DIY,not_removed,there are plenty of outlet options like this depends how many devices you want to use on either side one problem though this has a plug with cord down you wont get two into one outlet my bad looked again yes two will fit sideways cord

DIY,not_removed,good eye i bought a pack of these and theyve come in handy for just such a situation
DIY,not_removed,this would be more appropriate in rhomeimprovement and rhvac
DIY,not_removed,ah thanks i started with rhvac ill xpost to rhomeimprovement as well
DIY,not_removed,assuming you are trying to clean it for display i would let it sit in water for a week or so to let natural bacteria clean whats left of the organics off then bleachdry and see what its like
DIY,not_removed,this seems legit httphorseshoecrabscomhorseshoecrabshellpreservation
DIY,not_removed,soak it in a mixture of hydrogen peroxide baking soda and dish soap this is the recipe to get skunk out of dog hair but i have used it over and over to get organic smells out of many objects
DIY,not_removed,you need more lemon pledge
DIY,not_removed,find an ant hill put a cage over the shell so it dont get carried away by wild life and just leave it for a week or so if you want to bleach it use peroxide from a beauty supply drug store peroxide is too weak and chlorine bleach will yellow it
DIY,not_removed,cadaver beetles like they use in museums no idea where to get them
DIY,not_removed,try this or soak it in undiluted pine sol for hours
DIY,not_removed,regular ol fresh water
DIY,not_removed,thank you thats the method ive tried still smells
DIY,not_removed,now thats an interesting idea
DIY,not_removed,tried that ants arent going there
DIY,not_removed,certainly works on gangrenous limbs id give this a try
DIY,not_removed,i didnt think you were joking i upvoted this idea i may try it

DIY,not_removed,gorgeous work good job not a personal fan of the blackpainted pine i think it takes away from the fact that the purple heart is naturally purple but each to their own
DIY,not_removed,here is link to the geekbuilders build video
DIY,not_removed,that minion bandaid though
DIY,not_removed,yeah man job well done
DIY,not_removed,im honestly gonna give this a go except i dont have a band saw so fingers crossed for the hack saw
DIY,not_removed,you are great work
DIY,not_removed,i agree that the base is the weakest part i appreciate your honesty i still might go back and redo the base
DIY,not_removed,haha i forgot to edit that
DIY,not_removed,thanks
DIY,not_removed,the base is an after though it does fit the decor of my house but is not the best choice for the piece i agree the lines on the template are not wobbly but they are not spaced consistently but this was by design i was trying to avoid the visual aberration that occurs with repeated shapes and give it a slightly organic look the end result of the uneven sanding is a result of my skill level on the bandsaw and trying to fix issues with poor cut lines
DIY,not_removed,a fret saw might work better if you have access to one
DIY,not_removed,thank you
DIY,not_removed,i dunno against a dark background it might look more like the heart is floating maybe
DIY,not_removed,i say leave it in it looks badass
DIY,not_removed,you are welcome dude you sound a lot like that guy on this online radio podcast i listen to
DIY,not_removed,yeah for sure but my garage isnt connected to main electricity
DIY,not_removed,maybe although that wasnt the original intent that would be a cool approach though hmmm
DIY,not_removed,well you know all those podcast guys sound alike
DIY,not_removed,a fret saw is a small flexible manual type saw all hand powered
DIY,not_removed,actually i meant a coping saw although a fret saw would probably work as well
DIY,not_removed,ahh right google messed me up thats what id call a hack saw anyway unless there are minute differences
DIY,not_removed,the main difference is in the blade but still essentially the same idea
DIY,not_removed,looks super unsafe but nice skills see you in the burn unit
DIY,not_removed,wheres the fun if you dont get burned every now and then
DIY,not_removed,this is a brilliant idea how long did it take you to place all those corks though
DIY,not_removed,this is great did you get the corks from somewhere or just save them over time
DIY,not_removed,i made a backing out of ceiling tiles for my dart board then painted it this looks cool though
DIY,not_removed,like hours spaced over days im glad i did it though i get lots of compliments on it
DIY,not_removed,i bought them off craigslist i got giant trash bags for twenty bucks i still have a ton left over
DIY,not_removed,time well spent it looks awesome

DIY,not_removed,they usually have two tabs at the back additionally to the cables you can solder to them too i usually just cut off the attached wires and to avoid ripping tgem off i use two brops of poxy to fix them in place
DIY,not_removed,id say youre stuck with them if you attempt cut them down and solder thicker wires to them youll end up concentrating all the bending stress on the short length of original wire that remains if you really need to get thicker wires on there cut them down solder on the thicker wires and then glue the thicker wires to the case of the motor so they cant transmit bending forces to the thin wires and break them but i have to say not to insult you or anything but it sounds like the issue is that youre not being careful enougharent good enough at soldering i used to tear my hair out when id break a tiny wire coming out of a tiny component it happened all the time it just takes lots and lots of practice and you learn not to tug on wires which bends them sharply at the root where they usually break and how to strip them using either heat or the proper stripper so that you arent tugging or bending if you want a temporary solution you could take your thicker wires solder them to the thin wires and then tape the thicker wires to the case of the motor then when youre done breadboarding and want to permanently assemble the motors to a thing you can remove the tape and solder the thin wires directly
DIY,not_removed,in my case there are no exposed tabs the wires go right inside there is a plastic end cap which has holes to let them through i bought of them as a pack so must find a solution as the factory fitted wires are no good for prototyping
DIY,not_removed,thank you i learned a lot from your suggestion i definitely need more patience and follow better techniques soldering the tinyfragile material i have decided to strip off a portion carefully and insert that into the female header all secured by a tight heat shrink tube i imagine it would be better than the original thanks for guidance
DIY,not_removed,then just cut them down to and solder other wires to them again i would use heatshrink tubing and poxy to keep them from breaking off
DIY,not_removed,when you say header do you mean the wire entrance on the back of the motor or did you mean an external header ive never taken apart these motors but id be pretty surprised if the hole on the back was a header id figure its probably just a hole and that the wire was crimped or soldered to the brush assembly internally could be wrong about that though
DIY,not_removed,thanks mate the heat shrink should definitely do the job sadly only poxy i have is the one used in plumbing jobs nevertheless id double heat shrink it one for the wire extension and then another to secure the motors body and also warp over this joint cheers
DIY,not_removed,i meant an actual female header take two pins worth and inject stripped tinned wire of the motor into the receptacle of the female header and seal everything tight
DIY,not_removed,gotcha
DIY,not_removed,looks good add some new castle on that and youll be all set

DIY,not_removed,heres a couple sketchup pics i cant load into imgur for some reason this pic is trying to show how the dado on the back panel worked the blue part is one of the cabinets on the one side theyre basically mirrored and flank the wine rack cabinet instead of a single dado on that piece i put one on both sides a bit closer look and you can see that the wine rack cabinet back panel is overhung by a on both sides changed to green for pic and slips into a dado on the adjacent panel of each end cabinet

DIY,not_removed,
DIY,not_removed,oh man i wouldve thought putting a title and description on all pictures wouldve covered my bases i thought i went into pretty good detail too sorry i went back and added more pics a few of them pertaining to sketchup design that show how it went together i also perused the descriptions and tried to add more info the only issue i had was that i had to cancel the post in imugr to add more pics my first comment with the two picture links can be removed since i figured out how to get those into imugr not sure if you guys want to delete and have me repost or if you can change the imugr link back to the new one and remove my first comment heres the new link httpimgurcomauvvhg thanks
DIY,not_removed,listen to me listen to me right the fuck now do not let your dogs piss and shit on the artificial turf it will stink really really bad over time and you will never get the stench out and everyone will hate you looks nice btw
DIY,not_removed,your hoa wouldnt allow you to pour concrete between the yards but lets your neighbors driveway look like that damn priorities
DIY,not_removed,im not into the rope light but the rest looks x better
DIY,not_removed,a few people are commenting on how bad fake grass is i dont have a problem with anything you did here except for the led light rope that shit is so going to fail after one or two rainy seasons it may say its water proof and it is for awhile but guaranfuckinteed that shit will fail within the next two years i really hope you made available a way to get the entire thing out so it can be replaced
DIY,not_removed,man as a former cable guy hiding the green cable box under that rock cover would piss me off lol only if i didnt know it was there it looks good though well done on the yard
DIY,not_removed,can you give the cost breakout and what solar lights did you use ive been looking at them but i dont trust most of them
DIY,not_removed,neighbor take warning someone is going to off the end of that wall at some point and your aesthetics going to take a hit
DIY,not_removed,does your city have sideyard setback requirements it looks like you poured concrete right up to the property line which is illegal in most places
DIY,not_removed,i can kind of get the appeal of this especially over an alternative of a manicured grass lawn but i see so many missed opportunities for gravel and native landscaping that would look so much nicer and still require very little effort
DIY,not_removed,clearly you guys put a lot of sweat into this what are your thoughts on using native plants instead of astroturf aside from being super hardy drought tolerant ca has an amazingly diverse selection of plants think chaparral rather than desertsucculents like redbarked manzanitas fragrant sages beautiful grasses purple threeawn deer grasses etc yellowflowered yarrow the list goes on last year my parents hired a landscape designer through a native nursery southern ca and it took so much of the hassle out of trying to figure out what looked best big front yard a good designer will keep in mind your dogs and what would suite your house aesthetics rain fall sunlight etc without breaking the bank and saving you the stress of trying to be your own landscape designer
DIY,not_removed,axe the rope lights youre not in college anymore if you are going to use lights like that get a flat led strip so when you affix it to the overhang you cant still see the lights
DIY,not_removed,i dont get it why would anyone want a artificial turf yard
DIY,not_removed,brady bunch style
DIY,not_removed,multicolored ford ranger for contrast
DIY,not_removed,that artificial grass looks like it could make a good putting green
DIY,not_removed,why not put in a native plant garden using appropriate plants native to the area cuts down enormously on water waste helps to retain what rain does fall rather than channeling it into the gutter like cement and artificial grass do and looks really nice if done well a bit of gentle landscaping and some interesting rocks for texture and you can add to it if and when the water restrictions are eased up im sorry but this looks so sterile to me that it looks straight out of a lego movie parody of a suburban home
DIY,not_removed,its great that you have put in so much effort and are happy with the result its your home so you should absolutely do what you like with it i just cant help thinking it would have been so much nicer to replace the sick tree with a new one and mulch all around it minimal to zero maintenance and a living growing tree to enjoy over the years you live in the house but thats how reddit is good lots of opinions and you live with your own thanks for the post op
DIY,not_removed,you did a nice job with the retaining wall but i cant understand why youd cut down a tree to have a fake lawn made of plastic to each their own i suppose it is brighter green
DIY,not_removed,can someone explain to me why every one of these posts just gets shit on why do people even come to this subreddit if theyre just going to be negative cunts
DIY,not_removed,op you sure that maple tree was dead
DIY,not_removed,luckily comcast had done some trenching earlier in the year and we kept note of where the powergas lines traveled seriously for the love of all that is good and holy call digsafe when you dig
DIY,not_removed,im tempted to say something but just remembered that if i cant say anything nice i shouldnt say anything at all
DIY,not_removed,boo to fake grass
DIY,not_removed,amazing work how much was the artificial grass not having to water mow or fertilize is very appealing
DIY,not_removed,you should put a fucking garden in there i dont get peoples obsession with these sterile suburban lawns
DIY,not_removed,breaks my heart to see the tree cut down replaced with artificial turf
DIY,not_removed,looks good man im still not sure if id go with the turf if i did something like this but it seems to make sense for you so cool my only true dislike which im surprised hasnt been mentioned is that you didnt put back any sort of divider between your driveway and your neighbors doesnt help that youre neighbor also has an ugly vehicle maybe another small row of hedges would be better than the awkward patch of turf regardless your place looks way better def an upgrade imo also really digging the light strip raised yard and small deck
DIY,not_removed,looks great thanks for sharing i wouldnt even begin to know where to start with something like this so it was interesting to see the process the hoa is cool with the light rope
DIY,not_removed,is routing gutters to the street allowed by local law and hoa
DIY,not_removed,great job lets see the back yard
DIY,not_removed,i saw this yard in the lorax
DIY,not_removed,dude thats an awful lot of work to not need to mow the lawn
DIY,not_removed,it may look nice but natural grass has a plethora of added environmental benefits i see a lot of people leaving out besides providing an aesthetically pleasing scenery if well maintained natural grass also helps prevent erosion by stabilizing the surface soil with its roots grass also helps filter ground water as it infiltrates through the soil as well as removinglessening the effect of dust in the air compared to synthetic surfaces natural grass also provides quite a bit of a cooling effect synthetic surfaces are known to create what is called the island effect where the temperature in and around this area is significantly higher than neighboring zones overtime i would not be surprised if the cost to cool your house during the summer were to increase slightly compared to if this was a natural grass surface natural grass is also great at capturing excess carbon from the air and storing it in its roots decreasing the amount of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere while the inputs required to maintain a natural grass surface are always going to cause controversy in this topic the reality is that there are several low maintenance grass species that exists and do very well under limited or no input situations that includes waterirrigation while these species will never look quite as perfect as what you have created here they will provide you with some of the environmental benefits i have listed and ultimately allow you to decrease your carbon footprint and increase your oxygen footprint
DIY,not_removed,tacky af
DIY,not_removed,so sterile so bad
DIY,not_removed,i hope you have good air conditioning because that shit gets as hot as asphalt they have to stop kids soccer games to cool it down so kids dont overheat also the underlayment leaches heavy metals into the soil and kills it curb appeal maybe if youre trying to sell to somebody moving out of a trailer park
DIY,not_removed,gardens not lawns
DIY,not_removed,nice wall ugly grass is that supposed to be a putting green come on make some effort it doesnt have to be any kind of grass make it drought resistant plants and grasses some rocks and a boulder or two some redwood bark and whatever else looks good that just looks awful if i bought your house the first thing id do is yank out that carpet but id never buy your house bc anyone who installs that sort of thing cannot have a nice house so why even bother going inside seriously thats the way a lot of people are going to think plastic grass really
DIY,not_removed,looked better before
DIY,not_removed,installed artificial grass why the f would you do that
DIY,not_removed,the blocks you used look terrible the grass looks terrible the rope light looks terrible
DIY,not_removed,if you are never going to sell your house then good job otherwise no one is going to want that yard it does look better than what you had before though
DIY,not_removed,looks good id ditch the rope lights but retaining wall is a nice addition if you want light get some lowvoltage downlights they look a lot better and will last
DIY,not_removed,great job paint selections and over all making the place look fresh im not familiar with turf so i wont comment the two things that bug me the most are the solar lights and that your hoa wouldnt let you concrete next to the neighbor but the neighbor can apparently have gravel and park there i wouldnt be able to handle that at all as for the lights i think you could find something classic and maybe in black to really finish it off
DIY,not_removed,ha awesome
DIY,not_removed,looks great and with the added benefit of preventing small dogs from crapping on your lawn
DIY,not_removed,can i come over
DIY,not_removed,this looks great excellent work op
DIY,not_removed,this looks damned good
DIY,not_removed,now just need a windmill and some moats
DIY,not_removed,not a fan of artificial turf for a yard but considering the water restrictions it looks like youre under it looks good it really did boost your curb appeal nice job
DIY,not_removed,good work fuck the haters id be more concerned about skater punks grindin your wall
DIY,not_removed,awesome job not one night shot with the lights though unlike others in this thread i like that touch it stands out and i dont see whats particularly collegey about it seems unnecessarily stigmatic to me
DIY,not_removed,you should think about adding a dimmer switch to the rope light if it possible
DIY,not_removed,you also magically lost the brick pillars on your garage 🤔
DIY,not_removed,i think you forgot to put the tree back
DIY,not_removed,cities need to get rid of stupid setback rules that require things like lawns theres a reason some of the oldest cities on earth have courtyard houses
DIY,not_removed,house looks really good curb appeal much improved id call your project a success like the retaining wall and level front yard as others have suggested you may regret the artificial turf you might consider keeping the dogs off the front lawn you may end up having to fence it in to keep out wildlife feral animals and neighbors pets you could rip up a square of the turf in the back yard and replace it wsand then move any pet poo you find on the turf to the sand and get the dogs accustomed to putting the poo there too it helps if you feed them as far away from the sand litter box as possible if your yard were larger id suggest you consider digging deep post holes and adding lids to use as doggie poo septic tanks as an alternative youll probably need to save all your plastic grocery bags
DIY,not_removed,hey op in the last picture of the house completed the aluminum wraping from the window to the trim looks like it is overlapping on corners top and bottom easy fix if you take a pair of green snips and hold them in your right hand you should be able to get the top overlap flush use your red snips at a slight angle to get the bottom overlap if you want to know a way to have your wraps look pretty good look up how to make aluminum brickmold wraps toughest part is to remember to add the inch for the bend
DIY,not_removed,now to install the wind generator that kinda looks like a tree
DIY,not_removed,where can i learn all of this stuff i would love to learn how to build an plan for such large projects do i just ask around or internet
DIY,not_removed,i would have kept the bush or built a wall between you and your neighbour id be paranoid that hed drive over that strip of grass every time he pulls in and out haha
DIY,not_removed,looks stupid
DIY,not_removed,i really like it nice work that saidas a homeowner thats had neighbor issues with both my home and my mothers home thank your hoa for not allowing your driveways to be connected you like them now and maybe youll never have a problem with them or the next people but someone eventually will get pissy about something and youll be glad your driveways are separate
DIY,not_removed,all of this to never have to cut grass again
DIY,not_removed,congrats for reaching ralltop of the day top with your post nbsp i am a bot probably quite annoying i mean no harm though message me to add your account or subreddit to my blacklist
DIY,not_removed,sorry but artificial turf is not making your curb appeal game stronger only weaker
DIY,not_removed,love the wall the clean minimalist look but you havent raised the curb appeal for anyone standing on the curb while the overall look is better the plastic grass over the top rope lights and the weird out of place rock are a turn off that makes the house have a phony vibe before you step in you went too far from minimalist into tacky consider some low maintenance real grass all you needed to do to get that to grow better was delete that tree which you did a small low maintenance shrub would do a better job of hiding that cable box without looking odd and out of place like that rock does so more classic lighting choice like led lantern lights on the ground would look a lot more classy
DIY,not_removed,i mean its better than spreading blue rubber all over the place
DIY,not_removed,im not into artificial grass at all ughh capital letters but you did a great job for what you did
DIY,not_removed,replant the tree ditch the plastigrass then well talk
DIY,not_removed,how is fake grass a selling point fake grass tells me fake walls fake plumbing fake electrical and fake vale
DIY,not_removed,nice work but youre going to be getting a lot of flak about the artificial grass bc it always looks like shit
DIY,not_removed,you removed the tree
DIY,not_removed,looks great i like the lighting im curious as to why you cut off the rear offset seems to me that the wall is more likely to fail without them also you chose to splice the corners together instead of tying them together with alternating courses was this an aesthetic choice
DIY,not_removed,astroturf please theres nothing strong about that
DIY,not_removed,i like it well done the concrete pour was nice well mixed
DIY,not_removed,coulda gone with drought friendly grass
DIY,not_removed,you fucked up your yard dude
DIY,not_removed,ahh you are the people who buy fake rocks
DIY,not_removed,i hate to be overly negative but you chopped a seemingly nice looking tree down and put in a bunch of plastic in the ground im not sure how this is a positive
DIY,not_removed,neat is a good word dont know about appealing
DIY,not_removed,i dont understand why anyone would want artificial grass as if our cities werent ecological enough
DIY,not_removed,really unimpressed with artificial grass awful environmental decision definitely cant like this project only for that reason
DIY,not_removed,you replaced a real shade tree with a plastic yard i will never understand middle america
DIY,not_removed,pics artificial grass is a bad bad idea it will look like shit in months epic shit post
DIY,not_removed,how long will the turf stay green before it gets sun bleached and needs replacing
DIY,not_removed,not a fan wow you had something great going with the before picture could have resodded and chopped roots into something magnificent not this astro turf mess really looks out of place with everything else hope dogs dont pee on that
DIY,not_removed,down voted cos artificial grass
DIY,not_removed,that looks like more than a foot drop off the front so its a fall hazard are you sure its legal it wouldnt be where i live looks nice minus the rope light but id be afraid of passing kid jumping up and falling off onto the sidewalk
DIY,not_removed,awesome job it was so cool to read through the transformation does the hoa require your house number to be right on top of the garage door like that my eye instantly gravitated toward it and drew away from the cleanliness that the front facelift really did awesome job all around op
DIY,not_removed,wow it looks very nice good job well done
DIY,not_removed,one of the best damn projects ive seen nice work
DIY,not_removed,id like to see an evening full front view of the house with all lights on looks fabulous well done
DIY,not_removed,kinda looks cheesy imho
DIY,not_removed,it honestly looks worse most would prefer natural grass all you had to do was cut the dead tree down and then let grass grow on the ground
DIY,not_removed,thats not a yard lol thats a postal stamp sized plot of grass
DIY,not_removed,why artificial grass
DIY,not_removed,nothing beats artificial turf lots of concrete and a big white garage door yup you nailed it congrats
DIY,not_removed,great example of what not to do if you like nature
DIY,not_removed,i really like this great job
DIY,not_removed,why artificial grass
DIY,not_removed,sorry but artificial grass is ugly as fuck
DIY,not_removed,ab so lutely tacky wtf op
DIY,not_removed,looked far better before than after
DIY,not_removed,curb appeal is much improved and it certainly appears to be a fullassed effort not my particular aesthetic but i dont have to worry about drought restrictions given your stated ocd id recommend getting some masonry stain to try to match the mortar to the bricks it would stick out less from distance and give the wall a cleaner finished look otherwise pull that part out completely and adhere the bottom of the cap to the wall and maybe a few of the surrounding bricks if youre worried about it moving
DIY,not_removed,this wouldve looked tacky as shiteven back in the
DIY,not_removed,lol that poor cable guy picture that thing that you cover up with a fake rock cable guy is gunna need to get into that occationally
DIY,not_removed,i for one think its sexy af
DIY,not_removed,how long does your rope light last as we put up some so our dog could see outside and no matter the brand it seemed to die within months this was with it on only for minutes a day
DIY,not_removed,i feel like you should just go ahead and put a hole or two in there as well so you can play a little mini golf
DIY,not_removed,so many cars are about to get pwnd by that rock reminds me of that parking lot rock that everyone seemed to hit
DIY,not_removed,rented airbnb with artificial turf where dogs relieved themselves aside from the smell the health hazard from the bacteria is huge
DIY,not_removed,you just need to install it properly for pet use you need proper drainage and a layer of zeolite under the turf they also sell sprays that are designed to eat the ammonia that causes the stink most people who complain usually went the cheap way and didnt get a proper install im in the turf business and we sell to tons of dog daycare places and parks when done right you wont notice any smell
DIY,not_removed,they speak the truth my neighbour used to hang his fake grass on the fence on hot days to try and get the smell out you could smell it very strongly at least houses away someone must have gotten sick of it because it went missing whoever it was they are my hero haha
DIY,not_removed,this install was during the insane water restrictions in california so it was either this or bark plus with two dogs the grass wouldnt have lasted more than one summer we did the back yard too too late
DIY,not_removed,i never let my dog peepoop on artificial turf because i just feel like theres not the same bacteriawateringetc that goes on to break down anything i dont remove i didnt know this was actually a thing my cousins dog that i babysit sometimes only peespoops on cement and artificial turf its so annoyingi always have to pull him away but i guess i cant blame him hes a little shit zu
DIY,not_removed,good to know wont be doing turf then
DIY,not_removed,i worked for a major dog daycare chain for years and i can attest to this we had top of the line turf drainage and cleaning supplies and it still isnt enough to get the smell of dog piss out not to mention the poophair getting caught up in the small drainage holes and needing to use a giant rotating brush to get it out flinging it all over you in the process
DIY,not_removed,dad
DIY,not_removed,no you just need httpwwwkillermoviereviewscomwpcontentuploadsenvyblackjpg problem solved
DIY,not_removed,i lived in a neighborhood where we couldnt do our own landscaping even as everything died but we could put out pots and gnomes neighbors yard looked like a mini disneyland it was a protest move to get them to change the bylaws it totally worked edit
DIY,not_removed,please explain to me how a hoa works with my current understanding i would tell them to fuck themselves i thought this was america how do they enforce their rules
DIY,not_removed,if it was not directly visible itd pass but yeah needs something to hide it
DIY,not_removed,retaining wall and all look great rope lighting is tacky af
DIY,not_removed,always one step too far in this sub
DIY,not_removed,im not into artificial grass but the rest looks x better
DIY,not_removed,came here to say this it kind of make the whole thing look cheap
DIY,not_removed,tacky
DIY,not_removed,something less visible like a would hide much better under the lip and achieve the same effect
DIY,not_removed,looks like its just kinda stuck in a crevice along the edge
DIY,not_removed,one or two rainy seasons given that its southern california that means about years or so
DIY,not_removed,remindme years
DIY,not_removed,yeah just throw it in the landfill along with the plastic grass in a few years
DIY,not_removed,what do you do now if you dont mind me asking i also was a former cable guy and i dont miss it never encountered a fake rock but plenty of bushes and padlocked fences and dog shit i dont think ive ever stepped in so much dog shit than i did in those years
DIY,not_removed,i came here thinking the same thing trying to find that cable box would piss me off if i didnt know about it beforehand also concreting the side of the house that has the utilities would piss me off as well theres been too many times where i would be digging in the worst locations with concretepaversstonerock all around me on the plus side tt does look like there is an orange conduit for communications installed already so lines could always be ran through that still i cant help but wonder the mess it would be to replace the communications line or gas line maybe power as well its hard to tell in the pictures theres a meter on the wall there but its hard to tell where the drop is located
DIY,not_removed,yeah those rope lights can be sneaky little bastards
DIY,not_removed,yr old me would be out there at am waxing it up
DIY,not_removed,at least the skate vid will look cool with all that rope light
DIY,not_removed,aesthetics going to take a hit the fact that most of the rocks are glued together makes me think it wont be the only thing taking a hit eventually
DIY,not_removed,by take a hit do you mean become more radical
DIY,not_removed,might be worth looking into cheaper than replacing capstones
DIY,not_removed,the design of his plot and house screams southern california in the land of zero property lines this is just fine
DIY,not_removed,he said the hoahome owners association wouldnt allow him to pour right up to the property line so im assuming he is all good
DIY,not_removed,most places i did not know this whats the reasoning behind it
DIY,not_removed,lookout principal strickland just poked his head out of a passing automobile
DIY,not_removed,it sort of depends oftentimes retaining walls steps and the like are not considered structures and therefore are not subject to setback requirements in zoning i was however thinking along the same lines and wondering if the city has rules that specify the maximum percentage of a lot that can be impervious
DIY,not_removed,surprisingly relevant username
DIY,not_removed,appropriate username
DIY,not_removed,yeah the shear amount of impermeable surface area added during this project makes me uncomfortable agave and aloe would have done the curb appeal trick just as well in my opinion especially if you through in some lava rocks for accent that stuff looks dope
DIY,not_removed,and be completely unusable as a space
DIY,not_removed,if you cut off the outside of local cacti and nail them flat instead of using turf you get the same effect and the dogs wont poop on it
DIY,not_removed,this the lighting looks fuckin awesome but terrible up close go on ebay and get some warm white waterproof led strips and a cheap controller uses less power and cheap as fuck good job on the whole project however
DIY,not_removed,this install was during the insane water restrictions in california so it was either this or bark plus with two dogs the grass wouldnt have lasted more than one summer we did the back yard too
DIY,not_removed,from a professional landscapers point of view low maintenance is the most popular reason old people are the most common usuers and they like low maintenance no water no mow no weeding just green some young people want this now cause they work so much to pay the mortgage they dont want to come home and cut the yard the new fake lawns have fake weeds to sell the look personally i think its super tacky and will fall out of fashion like carpet and wallpaper did to each their own
DIY,not_removed,in seattle we have tons of water but people here have turf because it is very hard to keep weeds out and moss out you have to constantly maintain it plus water for the lawn during summer is expensive and most people preserve it for the salmon so artificial turf is increasingly popular i can imagine its much more popular in ca
DIY,not_removed,used to work in lawn care artificial turf yards are great theyve come a long way since the days of astroturf the new stuff looks just like the real thing only it doesnt need any maintenance watering or fertilizing and it always looks perfectly manicured
DIY,not_removed,i have one in my backyard and love it zero maintenance looks great doesnt feel as good to walk on but generally still feels pretty similar i feel like now id want it in every house i move to
DIY,not_removed,i want it i have large trees that im not allowed to remove which keep patches of the yard very dry with the amount of rain we have and water restrictions i cant water enough to maintain the grass
DIY,not_removed,i have fake grass its not astro turf so it looks like or much more like real grass no watering easy to clean up after the dogs no urine smell no mud no mowing etc so many benefits the downside is it can be expensive to have installed year warranty and potentially lasting years worth it
DIY,not_removed,i could never understand why anyone wouldnt want artificial turf hey im so glad i get to mow my weed lawn today said no one ever
DIY,not_removed,no mowing
DIY,not_removed,
DIY,not_removed,completely agreed i get that op can only do so much with the architecture of the house but that front lawn both before and after has no sense of place
DIY,not_removed,yeah i seriously dont see the appeal of fake grass at all as an above post mentions it absorbs terrible smells nothing would naturally biodegrade so youd constantly be cleaning it if one cares for it to look pristine what if it gets damaged how expensive is it to patch and fix should anything happen not to mention the unnatural color just no
DIY,not_removed,i totally get the logic but the tree was diseased and drying out there was the risk of it coming down on our house or our neighbors we have since planted new trees on the property
DIY,not_removed,doesnt matter much now does it
DIY,not_removed,it is now
DIY,not_removed,weve got a couple of these soft maples in our yard we rent not own theyre shitty trees alive or dead ours our alive but not well and they drop limbs like crazy and by limbs i mean fullsize roofsmashing peoplekilling limbs not just oh hey kindling for the firepit limbs weve been trying for years to get the landlord to take them down but apparently that costs money so not happening sigh you know what else will cost money landlord dude when one of them drops a fucking housesmasher on the trailer next door and kills someone thats what but hey whatever
DIY,not_removed,i think i saw in one of the picture descriptions crazy expensive
DIY,not_removed,yeah i guess there are reasons but its pretty sad that between the house concrete and turf i think the only part of actual ground that is exposed is the wood chips around the cable box
DIY,not_removed,and the brick on the house i hate everything they did
DIY,not_removed,nothing like the scent of chemical offgassing to wake you up in the am
DIY,not_removed,pressure wash and some simple green
DIY,not_removed,isnt there a saying that goes if you dont have anything nice to say something something
DIY,not_removed,whats you reasoning behind this
DIY,not_removed,i want him to do this to my properties landscaping is expensive
DIY,not_removed,in a climate like californias its really nice to have space outside for a shade tree it keeps the house and driveway cooler in the summer
DIY,not_removed,we gave our dogs a side yard of wood chips to use as their restroom it took some training but it makes the turf much more enjoyable
DIY,not_removed,i dont care about the selling point but it did boost an appraisal by a lot our house looks better than of other homes in our area i worked landscaping maintenance earlier in my life and realized that there is nothing nicer than a low maintenance yard one thing i learned about pvc plumbing is that its not if but when it breaks
DIY,not_removed,looks great to me
DIY,not_removed,the maple tree was dead the euonymous shrub beside the driveway was too big for its space
DIY,not_removed,but he planted
DIY,not_removed,because plastic doesnt make a mess every year and fill gutters and cover cars in leaves
DIY,not_removed,it was deaddiseased
DIY,not_removed,they replaced a dying tree that was planted too close to their house with a yard that doesnt require watering to stay green and then they planted two more it might not hit your personal preferences but thats not the ops concern
DIY,not_removed,depending on the colorfastness of the turf years for most some will resist fading for years plus
DIY,not_removed,i was thinking the same how weatherproof is it really plus animals doing their business on it
DIY,not_removed,that would be random kids fault for jumping in the first place you can build a wall up to feet high before you need an engineer
DIY,not_removed,yes they do they can be a pain but i think i think the purpose is good
DIY,not_removed,drought lots of people in droughtprone areas are taking out water wasting grass lawns and replacing them with rocks or artificial grass
DIY,not_removed,they weigh like pounds
DIY,not_removed,they make artifical grass systems specifically for dogs so they can piss and shit all over it ive personally specced this product before
DIY,not_removed,back in high school half my football team got staph after having camp on a turf field not sure if it was dog shit but it definitely wasnt sanitary
DIY,not_removed,are you saying that i still need to maintain a plastic lawn
DIY,not_removed,until this moment i had never envisioned people hanging their lawns out like laundry and its amusing to me wild
DIY,not_removed,haha where the hells my turf
DIY,not_removed,oh god
DIY,not_removed,wood chips thats called mulch man its what plants crave
DIY,not_removed,insane water restrictions haha go talk to an australian
DIY,not_removed,i think instead of insane water restrictions you mean perfectly reasonable water restrictions considering it almost never rained for years remember youve been in drought and will be in drought again planting grass now just because youre not in a drought is not smart
DIY,not_removed,what about a rock garden a zen sand pit a larger driveway fucking compost heap
DIY,not_removed,i went to the worst zoo the other day the only animal there was one dog it was a shit zoo
DIY,not_removed,shit zoo with little shit elephants and tiny shit lions and mini shit clowns scaring the shit out of everyone
DIY,not_removed,what
DIY,not_removed,no left a long time ago to go to the store still waiting years later
DIY,not_removed,kayla you better not be freaking smoking dad
DIY,not_removed,what the hell type of place is that it sounds like something from a seinfeld episode
DIY,not_removed,the fake grass isnt tacky
DIY,not_removed,like the lightsit overall it all looks pretty good
DIY,not_removed,yeah i see that but we didnt see how the lead was plugged in or how that bit was routed i dont see anything obvious above ground
DIY,not_removed,its been raining quite a bit in the last few months
DIY,not_removed,hes in the dog poop scoopin business much more lucrative
DIY,not_removed,i used to work for a subcontractor and buried cable i was sixteen and it was totally unregulated with no oversight because the piece of shit cable company was trying to cut costs by hiring worthless contractors we did such a shitty job that the cable was always exposed somewhere or would emerge from the yard eventually im betting the next guy or gal will be able to guess
DIY,not_removed,i came here thinking the same thing trying to find that cable box would piss me off if i didnt know about it beforehand but this way the people who live and walk around there dont have to look at that ugly ass box for the days of the year that you arent there working on it
DIY,not_removed,lolop doesnt seem to know about his easements hi we are here to tear out everything we own and whatever you put on top of our stuff is your problem id bet the catv co could require removal of the rock of they pushed it couldnt they as a dry utility consultant designing your infrastructure i find things like this humorous also we took note of the trench is just a bad idea please op or anyone else looking to do digging in their yard call before you dig its less than ft down to a gas pipe not a fun oops to work with grantedcyou most likely wont even have a bobcat let alone heavy machinery tearing things up but be safe
DIY,not_removed,maybe not a great link you could get that shit done locally easy for way less
DIY,not_removed,lol each
DIY,not_removed,almost three hundred fucking dollars what on earth
DIY,not_removed,lol theyre gonna kill themselves
DIY,not_removed,yep definitely looks like california that paired with his wifes uc davis sweater makes me pretty confident you are right
DIY,not_removed,wife was wearing a uc davis sweatshirt i think weve cracked the code
DIY,not_removed,home owners associations usually have nothing to do with zoning and have a separate set of rules
DIY,not_removed,each city has their own building codes and guidelines that require setbacks a set amount of space from the property line to the building eg from the house to the adjacent property must be clear its meant as a safety precaution the same concept that wont let someone build a fourth bedroom onto their home without the proper permits in this case its just a bit of concrete and not a structure so it doesnt impede anything its worth looking into to see if it violates any building code but i doubt it
DIY,not_removed,water drainage there usually needs to be a landscape strip around your property
DIY,not_removed,slackers
DIY,not_removed,try hanging out on that artificial lawn when it gets above degrees that crap will roast you a native landscape with some little paths and a sitting area would be waaaaay less expensive than artificial turf and actually increase the value of the home not to mention the benefits of attracting native wildlife bees butterflies etc
DIY,not_removed,its a front yard what exactly would you use that space for
DIY,not_removed,native ground covers are unusable as space but nonnative ones are also how much are you using a patch of turf in your front lawn
DIY,not_removed,youre not exactly going to be playing football on that size of a yard anyway now are you
DIY,not_removed,hey kids go play on the death lawn
DIY,not_removed,if youll allow me to oneup you from aliexpress
DIY,not_removed,i figured it must have been somewhere arid if this was the midwest youd be shunned if not run out of town
DIY,not_removed,i knew you would be a fellow californian we tore out our front yard grass and xeriscaped i got to plant all my favorite cacti and succulents and my husband even put a little rocky dry creek looking thing that does retain a little water for a while when it rains we get compliments on it constantly and the upkeep is so easy good for you for joining the water conscious although it really is just nice not to have a yard full of dead grass
DIY,not_removed,my aunt and uncle have fake grass in arizona that the dogs pee on its horrible stinks cuz of the dog pee
DIY,not_removed,its unfortunate that you think those were your only two options from the top of my head after waking up from a nap select a turf species that is suitable for the drought conditions in california it can still sequester carbon as well as act as a dust debris collector from atmosphere natural turf also acts as an atmospheric cooling agent with selected plants that look great and do well with the drought conditions in california it will add value as well as help the environment based off the plants that you have selected ie pollinators home for insects etc source turf management major
DIY,not_removed,ahhh that makes some sense then
DIY,not_removed,with two dogs sounds like you got the bark anyway
DIY,not_removed,looks good man well done
DIY,not_removed,you done goofed bro
DIY,not_removed,california not even sure why you bothered to install a drain s
DIY,not_removed,how does that workwhen a dog shits in your fake grass yard im guessing you have to go pick it up it wont degrade into the ground and the dog pisswhere does it go im thinking it will just bake in on the plastic and stink to high heaven
DIY,not_removed,the fake weeds thing is pretty funny imho are they like velcro bottoms so you can move them around if you want
DIY,not_removed,carpet is tacky and out of fashion
DIY,not_removed,my dad is actually trying to get moss to completely take over the back lawn so he doesnt have to mow it
DIY,not_removed,honestly not really people tend to go for local species or drought resistant succulents if they choose to forgo a traditional lawn
DIY,not_removed,isnt rainwater runoff an issue in seattle
DIY,not_removed,neighbor got one of those lawns two years go in the summer he needs to hose it down before the kids play on it otherwise they get burned that seems like a big trade off to me
DIY,not_removed,i used artificial turf for a cat tree my cat loves it we would also have patches of it in certain places around the house so she could lay on it
DIY,not_removed,it seems a bit bizarre to me as wellit sounds to me like saying oh hey i thought of getting a dog for company but then i realized all the work that comes with it so i just got me a plastic one instead its absolutely great zero maintenance doesnt need water or food easy to clean up after can definitely recommend no
DIY,not_removed,a lot of the country you mean homes in the desert who for some stupid ass reason maintain a green lawn
DIY,not_removed,well i can see the argument in water restricted areas but my lawn here in mn has very few weeds ill take my real lawn against an artificial one any day
DIY,not_removed,i like mowing my moss and weeds it smells good
DIY,not_removed,hank hill would politely yet firmly tell you to leave after that comment
DIY,not_removed,in my opinion which isnt worth much it looks odd and is obviously fake its like putting a giant plastic tree in your front yard and trying to convince people walking by its real just tear it out and go a different direction if you dont want a lawn lots of natural options out there other than grass
DIY,not_removed,gardening can be relaxing if youre into it of course
DIY,not_removed,it sucks to have to cut down a diseased tree but even if it hadnt been dying it was pretty close to the house it would only be a matter of time before its roots started messing up the pipes and foundation cutting down trees because theyre too close to the house sucks too but i blame the person who planted them too close to begin with btw i think it looks so much better without the brick facade the facade and the white trim together was too busy the brick looked out of place and the lack of trim on the side of the window made it look crowded and cut off its more open now the updated colors are clean and modern the tiny deck makes the space useful and it looks nice and shady it makes me want to relax and have a beer
DIY,not_removed,i think the whole setup looks a million times better nice work op
DIY,not_removed,props for planting two other trees well done
DIY,not_removed,you were ready for that comment
DIY,not_removed,from the pictures i am not understanding why you needed the retaining wall do you care to explain why you decided to go that route
DIY,not_removed,if one is a hazard to your house contact your local housing authority andor the company you have your renters insurance be sure you have something in writing notifying your landlord first though
DIY,not_removed,from the fake grass
DIY,not_removed,i dont doubt it what was the difference if you dont mind me asking great work btw
DIY,not_removed,must be vegas
DIY,not_removed,check back in a year
DIY,not_removed,if youre talking about the ibc requirements for drop without a railing then the height limit is inches not feet i might be misreading you though
DIY,not_removed,ok here its feet before you need a railing to prevent a fall theres no such thing as it would be the kids fault if youre the one who created the inviting feature for the kid to climb and didnt make it safe even if the kid is trespassing
DIY,not_removed,as long as they arent led by power hungry soccer moms with sticks up theyre asses they can be nice keeping the area clean some are just downright ridiculous
DIY,not_removed,lol i ment finding it i look for these all day already a pain to find one that is hidden under a fake rock oh geez
DIY,not_removed,or just grass
DIY,not_removed,too bad that isnt the product they used
DIY,not_removed,he could just rip it up and replace it with blue rubber mulch that way you can scoop up the blue rubber mulch with the poop and pee once the animals poop and pee enough youve removed all the blue mulch and then just go back to soil with xeriscape
DIY,not_removed,we did that in our very tiny backyard several years ago best decision ever
DIY,not_removed,probably goose shit those birds love open fields
DIY,not_removed,for the love of mary dont tell me i still need to maintain a plastic lawn next theyll be having me polish water stains off my plastic cutlery
DIY,not_removed,motherfuck
DIY,not_removed,i vacuum mine no shit modified an old roomba to do the job
DIY,not_removed,my parents have fake grass and run a dog boarding business they wash the grass every day with a special chemical spray that hooks on the front of the hose looks funny seeing my dad watering the fake lawn
DIY,not_removed,lawndry
DIY,not_removed,damn those grassnappers
DIY,not_removed,dude wheres my lawn
DIY,not_removed,i think they said they installed wood chips for the dogs to relieve themselves on in the front side yard
DIY,not_removed,plants eating their dead brothers metal as fuck man
DIY,not_removed,its what plants crave it has electrolytes
DIY,not_removed,it was just a farm stop calling it a shit zoo
DIY,not_removed,yes
DIY,not_removed,probably a retirement village those people are fucking nuts too much time too much crotchety
DIY,not_removed,just a regular neighborhood of town homes the original bylaws were written by the developer they held the contract on landscaping and it was written so that they would get paid for maintenance once they sold most of the units they were booted for a new contractor but the bylaws werent changed
DIY,not_removed,they did and no bird feeders or wind chimes they did allow people to maintain the landscaping by their doors
DIY,not_removed,it may not look great like real grass but its insanely practical for extreme water restricted cities in cali edit ok i get it yall dont like fake grass neither do i please submit your latest fanfic to rfakegrasshatred and ill select the best story and share it with my mother she also hates fake grass we can be in one big i hate fake grass family thanks
DIY,not_removed,the modern stuff isnt bad in small doses and its better than what op had before which had almost completely died off ive actually never seen an installation as big as ops so i cant say for sure but it might not look too bad in person shits pretty expensive though
DIY,not_removed,also op mentioned that he has an hoa its common for associations to tell you what you can put in your lawn ive even seen where you can only use certain breeds of grass the artificial might have been a better choice for him and his family
DIY,not_removed,synthetic turf has its place in high traffic areas and that place is not here i would pull up a catalog of xeriscape features you could plug that whole area with drought tolerant plants and rocks and have something less trashy
DIY,not_removed,after years
DIY,not_removed,depending on whats in the box coax tap coax amp phone lines fiber optics theres a chance someone could be in there quite often if its at an intersection of multiple roads then there is an even higher odds of needing inside of the box that existing box isnt even that terrible to look at it also looks like the original box was vented so the electronics inside could vent out their heat that they put off good luck trying to vent anything now with a giant fake rock on top of it honestly if the cable company was rude about it they could take it off and tell the homeowner to go fuck off if they wanted to the rock is more than likely against the right of way laws in the area
DIY,not_removed,thats for a piece kit theyre about
DIY,not_removed,but the hoa probably coordinates its regulations to fit under city laws and regulations so that could be why they told him no
DIY,not_removed,ah ok this makes sense ive heard of this law in the context of people who are building decks andor adding on to homes just not with laying concrete
DIY,not_removed,couch maybe a lazy boy
DIY,not_removed,an old ford ranger with out wheels
DIY,not_removed,just googled these and impressed with the comparisons ive used for my whole apartment and have a roll of i bought accidentally actually and didnt use them because they were so dim i think i was ripped off at that occasion but the do looks great in comparison from what ive seen now
DIY,not_removed,any other good aliexpress lighting finds
DIY,not_removed,well one of my neighbours in the uk put artificial grass in their front garden it doesnt look good especially in winter when its still bright green
DIY,not_removed,i figured it must have been somewhere arid i figured that one out when i saw there wasnt plastic pipe air gapping the area where the gas line comes through the concrete youre really banking on not getting any freezing or shifting there
DIY,not_removed,im fairly certain this would violate city code in my minnesota city
DIY,not_removed,the brady bunch did it
DIY,not_removed,if this was the midwest youd be shunned if not run out of town that seems crazy many places pay you to do this las vegas because of the water savings
DIY,not_removed,i dont know understand why this isnt a thing everywhere obviously not cactus but native plants in their native habitats if you have kids that like to play in the yard then i get it but why so many people force themselves to be slaves to the lawnmower
DIY,not_removed,have any photos of your yard would love to see it
DIY,not_removed,i love the succulent cacti landscaping though i hope you are using natives it looks so much better than fake grass imo but i work in natural habitat restoration so love to see people adopting this more at their homes
DIY,not_removed,my brothers landlord changed the grass for sand and cacti a couple of years ago the local cats use it as a sandbox
DIY,not_removed,nice do you have a pic
DIY,not_removed,that sounds really cool are you willing to post pictures
DIY,not_removed,the people who say it doesnt stink are full of it i live in la and they put the fake grass in places like downtown and it stinks something awful i went to go check out this beautiful old building that was rennovated with a rooftop pool the apartments were gorgeous with the big wood and glass doors reminiscent of old detective office doors with the name on them wide open living spaces central it was awesome then we went up to check out the rooftop pool in the middle of summer and as soon as the elevator door opened you could smell it hot plastic and rubber coated in dog piss the air was acrid i couldnt get over it moved into another building a few blocks away
DIY,not_removed,yes and yes
DIY,not_removed,i dont think so but thats not a bad idea the very latest most expensive fake lawns are almost indistinguishable from real lawns they have come along way since astro turf i went with a sustainable mediterranean front lawn with drought tolerant shrubs olive trees and decomposed granite pathways also a dg driveway widening strip
DIY,not_removed,hardwood flooring is a huge selling point in a home people will even advertise that theres original hardwood flooring under the carpets that can be restored
DIY,not_removed,bare floors with area rugs is where its at now ideally hardwood
DIY,not_removed,deleted
DIY,not_removed,if you dont have the finest marble floors you might as well rip them up
DIY,not_removed,yes our current home is construction and has these beautiful pecan floors pretty rare in our neck of the country that the previous owner had covered up with carpet we ripped all that shit out asap and restored the original floors looks amazing
DIY,not_removed,yes and no yes hardwood floors are a huge selling point but most people balance a house out so some areas are carpeted or tiled etc its not all hardwood or all carpet its a healthy mix
DIY,not_removed,yeah you think you want one but did you know a high quality artificial lawn costs the regular price of a traditional lawn did you know they are made from fossil fuels and have a substantially higher cabon footprint than traditional lawn did you know when you decide to remove this lawn it must be disposed of in a landfill and that you now have compacted dirt and subbase that needs to be addressed just some food for thought
DIY,not_removed,its one of those weird switches that flips for some people later in life when i was a teenager i hated cutting the grass its my dads lawn why doesnt he cut it the lazy bastard then i got my own place and waiting a week to cut my grass was awful it became this zenlike practice for me every saturday morning i crack open a drink i pull out my mower i throw in a set of ear plugs and for the next hour im in the zone i regain some semblance of order in an otherwise relatively hectic life and now that theres no one to mow my dads grass for him he started mowing again and hes said i cant believe how much i missed this but we both agree fuck weed whacking
DIY,not_removed,oregon this is my life
DIY,not_removed,your should tell him to look into native ground cover crops like clover or moss too depending on the type they grow only few inches and are dense so few weeds can grow plus some of them actual flower in the spring so they look nice this is what im trying to do at my house in or
DIY,not_removed,happily you guys have more choices succulents are not that possible here we ourselves are going for a nice clovermoss combination its very authentic and slippery
DIY,not_removed,i lived in seattle up until a year ago and saw zero artificial lawns maybe op is accurate but i dont think its quite as popular in seattle as shes saying
DIY,not_removed,based on this submission no it doesnt it looks like mini golf pics might not do it justice the stuff ive seen in person looks pretty good
DIY,not_removed,depends on area to an extent maybe not the best choice in certain climates but certainly a good choice in many cases
DIY,not_removed,i didnt realize having a lawn made people happy in the same way a dog did my parents replaced their lawn with xeriscaping and the native plants bring far more birds and butterflies to the garden than the old turfgrass ever did plus they dont die in the winter and hardly ever require any extra water
DIY,not_removed,lol i didnt realize your grass gave you all the same love and attention a dog could maybe its much more to you but my grass is for looks only well that and so the dogs have space to play and piss
DIY,not_removed,this makes absolutely sense if the yard were completely unusable then you might have somewhat of an argument but im pretty sure most people would love a dog that didnt need to eat required little maintenance and still gave you the joy of a normal dog
DIY,not_removed,that analogy makes no sense
DIY,not_removed,just wanted a flat usable area for petskids to play in not doing a retaining wall would have e required too much digging through roots and way more dirt removal
DIY,not_removed,thats just it its not a hazard to the building we live in just the neighbors
DIY,not_removed,you get what you pay for good turf lasts anywhere from years with proper maintenance
DIY,not_removed,double checkedretaining wall in ca is in this guys city it can be with no more than contained behind it before you need a permit
DIY,not_removed,two feet dont kids bounce where you are where he lives he can have one thats feet if any kid falls off someone elses property where its not invited its asking for trouble how about taking some responsibility
DIY,not_removed,former cable guy here this was my first thought to the guy below insinuating a someone who cant tell it is fake is stupid doesnt know whats up yes i would find it eventually id roll up to a house walk around looking for a ped if it isnt an aeriel drop if ai cant find it in plain sight after or minutes i would pull out the node map id have to turn my laptop on pull up the node map folder for the town i am in pull up the pdf for that node zoom in on the address find the ped on the map in relation to the lot then say oh that stupid fake rock that isnt cable company property is hiding the ped pick it up do my work get stung by multiple wasps because that probably isnt sealed well and there is a giant wasps nest in there run around the neighborhood like a bathsalted floridian swearing at the wasps finish work and remember that ped cover next time sure not that big of a deal but why is the cable guy always late the previous customer in this case i would say a good to minutes would be wasted just because i am not sure cable property is under that rock so i am not messing with customer propery until i know for sure related frustrating tap situations locked fence around lot where tap isnot often the customers lot but a neighbors unlocked fences with unchained dogs in the yard an aerial drop with a shed in the only accessible part of the lot so gaffing is required cant gaff because of dogs or chain fences bushed etc man i hated shitty tap locations glad i am not a cable guy anymore
DIY,not_removed,to be fair if you cant tell that rock is fake and its hiding utilities you probably are qualified to work for comcast
DIY,not_removed,oh i got ya i thought you were thinking they were heavy
DIY,not_removed,grass requires water and sometimes that can be a challenge
DIY,not_removed,just eat with your hands hands natures cutlery and after a couple bowls of soup your hands will be nice and calloused and scarred and you wont feel a thing ever again
DIY,not_removed,youre hired
DIY,not_removed,works on two levels
DIY,not_removed,i bet the most exciting part of their week is a hoa meeting
DIY,not_removed,im more of a fan of drought tolerant gardens here in san diego
DIY,not_removed,gravel and native plants are just as practical and would look better
DIY,not_removed,stone garden desert garden there are myriad options to fake turf
DIY,not_removed,they make artificial grass that actually has different colored blades mixed in as well as some slightly brown colored areas i would be all for it except i live in idaho it would looks weird as fuck in the winter to have this perfect lawn
DIY,not_removed,honestly some people just dont like that aesthetic rocks and cacti seem very barren and uninviting
DIY,not_removed,and have in your pocket
DIY,not_removed,the op even said that if you ask nicely they might come put in a lower profile better looking box the cable company will always be too cheap to make things look nice unless everyone pressures then to be nice we dont have ugly boxes like that here but older multifamily buildings always have a hideous spider web of coax running around their exteriors because cable installers just drill in wherever they want you dont have to accept eyesores but they will certainly give you an eyesore if you stay silent
DIY,not_removed,yea i noticed the same thing but man still crazy expensive for what it is
DIY,not_removed,i see youve never dealt with a hoa before eh you are wrong though hoa very rarely knows anything about building code or easements not unless they hire someone who does and they aint doing that for one dudes lawn work
DIY,not_removed,as someone that has served on an hoa board before you are frustratingly incorrect the hoa dgaf about the city rules just their own sigh
DIY,not_removed,hoa are their own private hell nothing to sopwith any zoning or city ordinances
DIY,not_removed,usually decks are less of a problem than concrete because water can run between the boards
DIY,not_removed,you could put that on top of the artificial turf anyway who puts a couch on their front lawn
DIY,not_removed,thats weird was it just that your power supply was underpowered for the thats the one downside wattled adds up quick
DIY,not_removed,a korean guy that lives down the street from me dug up his entire front yard and filled it with onions looks like that now
DIY,not_removed,well good news hes in southern california where it looks like in winter
DIY,not_removed,not too mention in years it will be sun faded talk about a shitty thing to have to replace
DIY,not_removed,my family friend had a super expensive install of fake grass it looks and almost feels like real grass i did not even realize it was fake and complimented him on how nice his grass looked i guess the quality of the turf plays a big role
DIY,not_removed,brit here hard to imagine not having rain
DIY,not_removed,definitely a certain percentage of your property has to be grassetc for water runoff
DIY,not_removed,the bradys lived in calfornia
DIY,not_removed,many people think native plants look like weeds which is too bad as there are many example of well done landscaping with natives that look really good
DIY,not_removed,i guess i dont think of it as being a slave to a lawn mower im a relatively young home owner here in minnesota and growing up it was either me or my brothers job to mow the lawn during the summer we thought of getting to use the mower as being cool and grown up stuff of course wed screw up turn to hard and rip up grass miss spots etc dad would teach us and wed get better and learn the ins and outs of lawn care now in my neighborhood with my own house i think of it as a treat to make my own lawn look good had a crazy battle with moles last summer damn grubs walking barefoot on a well kept lawn thats the best what a wild year old i am
DIY,not_removed,because most people with lawns are well adjusted adults who dont see doing chores once a week as slavery
DIY,not_removed,because a nice green lawn is awesome
DIY,not_removed,i grew up in arizona and tbh these still usually cheap and crappy to me i think its more the rocks everyone uses idk do you have pictures of awesomelooking xeriscaping
DIY,not_removed,mowing a lawn isnt really that much effort it takes an hour a week give or take if it takes longer its because the owners wants it to or is too cheap to pay for properly sized equipment
DIY,not_removed,the cult of the grass is a strong one my wife is a very ecofriendly person but even she still wants a grass lawn once we settle down back into a house we own i just want to full on xeriscape everything but im from the area so xeriscaping just makes me feel like my childhood romps in the woods
DIY,not_removed,check out lawn porn on fb many do
DIY,not_removed,here is one i just took
DIY,not_removed,i submitted a bunch of the succulents growing there into rsucculents a little while ago if you check out my post history under submitted ill try to dig out the imgur link for you though im not me not show much of the whole actual yard let me go see if i can take one real fast before i lose the light
DIY,not_removed,tell him to pee in a cup and scatter it all around the perimeter of the yard it works pretty well he could also go get some coyote pee i forgot where they sell it but it shouldnt be too hard to find i had that problem for a little while but the pee trick worked and it was aided by the fact a great horned owl moved in to the pine tree in the neighbors yard across the street no more cat problem
DIY,not_removed,get some kind of rocks instead
DIY,not_removed,i have a lot of deciduous trees here also a butt load of fruit trees and nut trees so we have a significant amount of leaf drop in the winter here as well i will say another advantage to having this xeriscaped front yard is the leaves rake off the limestone stand very easily the wind usually takes care of the rest
DIY,not_removed,i live in ohio and most of our trees are deciduous so we get lots of leaves but i used rocks in my garden instead of mulch so the leaves just fly right off when i use a leaf blower my rock garden areas look super clean when i do the leaves
DIY,not_removed,this is one i took as the sun was setting today because its winter my succulents are looking a little dreary but they always come back you can also look in my submitted post history i have some pictures that i posted a few months ago to rsucculents that showed some closeups although those photos were right after the summer heat so some of the heatsensitive succulents were having the opposite problem lol
DIY,not_removed,plus the temp of artificial turf is crazy a degree sunny day makes artificial turf temps reach over degrees
DIY,not_removed,i want to see
DIY,not_removed,in my place a previous owner had put down carpet for some reason multiple layers no clue why when we finally got down to the wood it was original from a house we didnt realize the best part of the wood for a bit there was a seam between two pieces running long a seam it was out of place and then we started looking every piece of hard wood in the floor for two rooms is long except for maybe a half dozen spots and one patch
DIY,not_removed,what about those tiles that appear to be hardwood those anywhere near where its at
DIY,not_removed,i swear to god baby boomers are the worst as a generation they covered over beautiful hardwood floors with all manner of sins from terrible carpet to cheap linoleum
DIY,not_removed,hes actually a botanist by training so hes doing a pretty successful job of getting nature to spread from the woods and take over the yard most of the remaining lawn area in the back is now clover like you describe in addition to the moss in the front hes gotten a solid portion of the hillside replaced with native shrubs i also like it because it means i dont have to mow the lawn when i visit
DIY,not_removed,in my opinion traditional green lawns look so tacky and out of place in arid areas anyways xeriscaping looks so much better
DIY,not_removed,haha no propably not the love and attentionim just saying that for me natural healthy grass is so much more than just looks stuff like the great feeling of walking on cool grass in the heat of the summer and seeing it grow again every year i hadnt realized that theres apparently people who dont care for things like that when setting up a garden
DIY,not_removed,just spray paint the dirt green
DIY,not_removed,good point i forgot that ca is basically the only state in the union that goes beyond ibc i built a railing project out there once and our bolts all cost like apiece instead of the theyd cost in the midwest earthquakes
DIY,not_removed,yall have node maps fuck me im a contractor i gotta figure that shit out by myself
DIY,not_removed,bazinga
DIY,not_removed,the fact that access to water is an issue baffles me but im also from minnesota so its not like were going to run out of water anytime soon
DIY,not_removed,and sunlight
DIY,not_removed,only when you choose to live in an unsustainable environment
DIY,not_removed,grass natures astroturf
DIY,not_removed,dont tell me i have to maintain my hands now
DIY,not_removed,and for the lawn just bulldoze it and make a huge driveway
DIY,not_removed,ah the old dolphin flipper usually implemented with a jar of nutella or peanut butter make sure to do the dolphin squeak after every mouthful too also helps to be highvery high
DIY,not_removed,or just drink out of the bowl
DIY,not_removed,calloused and scarred and you wont feel a thing ever again much like my heart
DIY,not_removed,theyre hit and miss in my neighborhood some people know how to landscape and theyre incredible for others its just a horrible combination of randomly placed cacti bark and rocks
DIY,not_removed,im a fan of rock gardens and drought resistant plants like succulents cactus whatever is natural to your area
DIY,not_removed,a family friend of mine is a pretty wealthy dude and had his whole yard done with turf i think he said it cost him like grandsurprisingly small area for btw actually looks insanely nice when i went to his house and stood on his grass i did not even know that it was fake and told him that he has the nicest grass ive ever seen it even felt like real grass
DIY,not_removed,and you know wtf do you do with a yard of rock and cacti wasted space
DIY,not_removed,well of course theyre there to do things the cheapest fastest and easiest way the company exists to turn a profit
DIY,not_removed,at that point itd be more of an issue with the impervious material restrictions if the property has them its less that there needs to be area around the property for drainage but more that a set percentage of the property must be pervious material eg grass for drainage
DIY,not_removed,trump supporters oh snap
DIY,not_removed,i tried it on multiple cause i knew it had a higher current draw and nothing i think i just got a bunkscam batch on ebay lol
DIY,not_removed,that would be pretty sweet actually
DIY,not_removed,beauty
DIY,not_removed,it looks like that for about a week after that rain stops
DIY,not_removed,nah ive installed some of these before and they are really well engineered for their purpose the company whose product i installed carries a year warranty against fading which is pretty standard
DIY,not_removed,arizonan here modern artificial turf can be really good its often fucking expensive but it rarely looks bad
DIY,not_removed,dude mint lawns will be in people with real grass will be spray painting that shit mint green just to look like they paid for it
DIY,not_removed,that was back in the berenstein universe theyre from indiana now
DIY,not_removed,it really should be a bigger issue peoples lawns and yards occupy so much space its a travesty to let it only be constantly mowed grass rural properties are the worst example i can kinda get wanting turf in the desert but im positive itd be more environmentally beneficial to maintain native plants
DIY,not_removed,money landscaping is ridiculously expensive to get done well a plain grass lawn is really cheap to put in grass seed is really damn cheap and easy to do yourself and really cheap to maintain since a lawnmower isnt that expensive having a landscaping company come in to not only bring in the right plants plants are expensive but to design and then actually put in the landscaping can be in the thousands to tens of thousands depending on size a friend of mine owns a landscaping company and he told me about a house he did here in colorado a acre plot around square feet done in water saving succulents and some rock work and pathways cost
DIY,not_removed,we thought of getting to use the mower as being cool and grown up stuff minnesota kids
DIY,not_removed,lol wildman i deleted my edited comment but i too grew up doing mine and my neighbors lawn for money i hated it so much hitting a patch of dirt and getting covered in a fine powder of grit when youre sweating your ass off dealing with hayfever and hitting rocks or wood chunks that fly out of the mower at bullet speeds i can see if you have a nice piece of property but its always been torture for me
DIY,not_removed,do you live in an episode of pete and pete i think you might
DIY,not_removed,youve clearly no seen my lawn the flash couldnt cut my lawn in an hour
DIY,not_removed,our your backyard is multiple acres my parents
DIY,not_removed,holy shit are those agaves how much did those cost
DIY,not_removed,oh nice looks great
DIY,not_removed,looks great the people across the street from recently did something nice like that seems better than a lawn
DIY,not_removed,good lord those agaves are gorgeous
DIY,not_removed,i love interning for a landscaping company i can name a lot of the plants thats a sago palm an american blue agave blue chalk sticks cordyline purple flax midnight brambling aeoonium and aloe
DIY,not_removed,does that gravel and sand ever wash out onto the sidewalk i guess if youre xeriscaping rain isnt an issue lol
DIY,not_removed,nice thank you ill let him know
DIY,not_removed,thats so cool thanks for posting have you noticed any critters that enjoy it i live in the midatlantic so i have no idea about desert gardening we plant to attract birds and butterflies here so im assuming you do the same
DIY,not_removed,yes on main and like
DIY,not_removed,httpimgurcomthvxkbg
DIY,not_removed,woodlook tile is a fantastic alternative to hardwood flooring preferable actually in many instances so long as youre not fracturing or breaking the tiles theyre maintenancefree and the sustainability of the look is superb i know some people just prefer the feel of having real hardwood but id go for the tile any day same price with none of the hassle of upkeep
DIY,not_removed,yes luxury vinyl lvt is another great option
DIY,not_removed,right on yea i should emphasize the try part for me lol i got several tall doug fir trees that are making it impossible for things to grow besides weeds immediately under them but yea beats the hell out having to mow a yard
DIY,not_removed,thats shitty node maps are like suoer important for trouble shooting really i should have been pulling them up at every job usually did for installs always did for trouble tickets never did for disconnections the node map shows amp and tap values for hiw the plant is balanced so when you hook your meter up if anything looks a little weird bump your numbers against the map do a little math work toward the amp and find the issue so you may have to check or taps check the amp all while climbing uo and down a ladder going down the line a lot of wasted time also why the cable guy is late side note fuck squirrels
DIY,not_removed,this is what lawns look like in az
DIY,not_removed,clearly you have never lived in the desert
DIY,not_removed,im the jackhole here i live blocks away from a reeeallly big lake lake ontario and i dont travel often i pain for the troubles california is having i like their strawberries
DIY,not_removed,im more worried about flooding
DIY,not_removed,certainly the problem is far less pressing in minnesota but to think that water issues wont impact minnesotans is probably mistaken see white bear lake for a recent very visible example of water scarcity in minnesota while i wouldnt expect that sight to become widespread in the short term the fact is that use is outpacing the rate at which a number of the most used aquifers can replenish their supply
DIY,not_removed,im from san antonio back in the day when we were in severe drought we had assigned watering days and the city would impose fines for excessive usage moving to a place that didnt do this was weird people waste so much water
DIY,not_removed,also minnesotan can we have less water sometimes its just too much yanno im not looking forward to all the mud pit driveways come thawing time i just realized that other states dont have to curve every road around lakes like we do thats also a thing been in this state all my life no plans on moving
DIY,not_removed,yeah the new stuff is really good we go to a big dog gathering in our city every year this year they had a company there showing off their artificial turf the stuff is insane how nice it feels im obsessed with it simply for the efficiency of not watering it and the lower maintenance but i think it would look so weird in the dead of winter to have a perfect lawn
DIY,not_removed,and people with rope lights
DIY,not_removed,i assume they have probably come a long way since the first ones were introduced years ago high sun though can be super damaging id be surprised if years in the phoenix sun wouldnt fade it a lot
DIY,not_removed,i understood that reference
DIY,not_removed,landscaping is ridiculously expensive to get done well this is truth i just had pros remove concrete stairs and install rock work with slab stairs enlarge the planting beds shrink the lawn and install some native ferns etc nothing big except the rock work and it was over that was friends and family pricing as i used to be in the business however it looks nicely done nothing too hgtv like nothing trendy just a cool comfortable back yard
DIY,not_removed,just do it yourself
DIY,not_removed,son dad the lawn mower isnt starting donchaknow dad oh you know it might be the starter plugs son oh geez dad oh geez
DIY,not_removed,my dad fastened a block of wood to the pedals of our riding mower so he could make me cut the grass around age
DIY,not_removed,youre not going to install artificial turf or landscape multiple acres though grass is as easy as it gets unless youre going to just let it go wild
DIY,not_removed,properly sized equipment i would have at least a mower if i had to do several acres every mow
DIY,not_removed,riding lawn mower will take care of it quick
DIY,not_removed,if its multiple acres you get a riding mower or you let a portion of it grow wild
DIY,not_removed,thats just an excuse to get a badass riding mower
DIY,not_removed,yep those are two large blue agaves and one big green octopus agave i also have three more blue agaves that are slightly smaller scattered around they love the climate here so they grow super fast and they make a lot of pups they make so many so fast i couldnt even give them away and keep up with them so unfortunately a lot go in my green waste i grew those two monsters from about onethird the size they are in this photo i got them for free the octopus i bought when it was about half that size edit since i just realize there is nothing to reference scale in this photo the front most blue agaves are about feet tall at their largest middle points it does definitely suck when it comes time to trim them
DIY,not_removed,thanks friend i love plants succulents and cacti hold an extra special place in my heart
DIY,not_removed,thank you i love them so much sometimes when i get an especially beautiful pup i plant it without telling my husband then after a few weeks or months hell ask me where all the god damn little agaves came from ha he knows very well where they came from the only reason he gets mad is because they will eventually become huge theyre soooo pretty though
DIY,not_removed,fair question we have actually had a ton of rain this year for us anyway and it doesnt really move at all the limestone sand creates a hard layer like a crust once it gets wet one time so its pretty darn wind resistant even pounding rain hasnt moved it although the regular dirt and soil i used to make the water troughs around my larger palms collapsed under the rain those are the only things i need to rebuild and the sand around it is pristine its all about using the right stuff
DIY,not_removed,yep my backyard is more bird and butterfly friendly but in the warmer months i have shallows that like to hang out in the blue agaves they get especially active inthe evening when theyre out eating insects
DIY,not_removed,you guys have to be best friends now
DIY,not_removed,i love the way they look and am saving so i can get them installed i wanted to ask in case i was missing some huge obvious downside
DIY,not_removed,in florida those porcelain tiles that look like wood are all the rage basically bomb proof and look like hardwood i wouldnt put anything else down
DIY,not_removed,are people not doing wood laminate as much now i have a wood laminate floor on my floor that the previous owner had installed about years ago and it looks amazing and is pretty tough i was thinking of having another wood laminate put on my first floor on top of my tile floor rather than have the tile broken up and redone im not sure if thats a good idea though
DIY,not_removed,the fact that people want to have green lawns in the desert is what baffles me
DIY,not_removed,heres a shitty panorama of my back yard from last fall in comparison
DIY,not_removed,lol is no one gonna mention you linked bristol palins yard
DIY,not_removed,where do dogs go to the bathroom right on the rocks and if it never rains it never washes away right
DIY,not_removed,correct minnesota is not a desert and ive lived here my whole life
DIY,not_removed,i wouldnt live in a desert because there isnt any water
DIY,not_removed,til pain is a verb
DIY,not_removed,plus we have all the finger lakes
DIY,not_removed,which is easy for something basic like just grass even really nice grass or putting in a garden or flower bed actual landscaping is actually incredibly difficult especially if you have any decent sized yard it takes a lot of time know how and experience even putting in a basic pathway through grass is expensive just due to all the materials that go into it you cant just dig a path and put some paver stones in you need all the right landscaping fabric substrate gravel and then the pavers and its incredibly hard work doing all of that it has to be level you have to tamp it down correctly that takes experience its not something you want to just jump into hell just look at this job from op its a pretty basic retaining wall with stone from home depot and artificial turf i guarantee it cost damn near if not more and they did most of it themselves the turf gravel and chicken wire alone was over to have someone come out and do this would have been well over
DIY,not_removed,is this a cut scene from fargo
DIY,not_removed,pretty accurate
DIY,not_removed,they have a riding mower and some of it is wild it still takes about an hour and a half to mow the part they upkeep
DIY,not_removed,i couldnt even give them away and keep up with them so unfortunately a lot go in my green waste find a neighbor willing to make tequila winwin
DIY,not_removed,cool didnt know that about the limestone layer
DIY,not_removed,ah im sure they love playing in them great job i love when people do native gardens when i own my own house thats the first thing i want to put in
DIY,not_removed,check out the bamboo tiles too awesome look and damn near bulletproof
DIY,not_removed,ahh nice same the only cons i know of are pretty much tile is cold and grout suckslooks ugly but summer is like months a year where i am i dont mind the grout and grouttile is easy to clean imo so ¯ツ¯ just remember to have a few spare pieces on hand just in case theres any pieces that end up breaking
DIY,not_removed,the fact that anybody cares baffles me why do we need a specifically bred plant that we cut to barely survivable lengths to not be seen as lazy assholes
DIY,not_removed,all we need is salt tolerant grass
DIY,not_removed,one thing that is often overlooked about lawns in the desert is that grass is superb at preventing soil erosion by thoroughly covering soil so that whatever rain does fall is retained much longer without evaporating or flowing and contributing to run off and soil erosion grasses are also extremely resilient plants many of them coming back from the roots even if the top completely dies back from droughtheatetc however grasses ecological niche is to group up between other sorts of plants fortunately there are grasses suited to virtually any environment many of the most drought or flood tolerant grasses are textured in a way that wouldnt necessarily make them soft places to lay down in nor would it make them green expanses but theyd certainly help with soil and water retention
DIY,not_removed,exactly fucking twats waste billions of gallons of water they cannot spare for nothing
DIY,not_removed,wait do you live in a public park
DIY,not_removed,thought thats beautiful thought mowing it though
DIY,not_removed,awesome to host a party
DIY,not_removed,hey its you did you post a bragpic of your balcony a year or two ago that was an awesome shot and if this is you the yard remains awesome weve got our own wickedcool place but im a bit envious all the same
DIY,not_removed,thats a good panorama dont beat yourself up also your yard is pretty
DIY,not_removed,evaporation and manual picking up i assume even here where theres grass and rain you dont necessarily want to leave dog shit all willy nilly you gotta pick it up sometimes
DIY,not_removed,i like water it does good stuff
DIY,not_removed,this is totally unrelated but i love your username it made me giggle
DIY,not_removed,artificial grass is tacky as fuck there are plenty of youtube videos that will show you how to manage your garden properly and youll learn something in the process besides if you cant afford the money or effort to care for your yard then why would you have it
DIY,not_removed,i like the way you think although to get them to the size and quantity you would need to make tequila youre looking at a huge land investment which is mucho money around here the other problem is almost everyone with a yard has them somewhere as i mentioned they love this climate so theyre all over and everyone has their own pups to deal with hence why i cant give them away
DIY,not_removed,thanks i love it so much the backyard is succulents cacti fruit trees hummingbird feeders and my veggies but want to integrate some flowering native shrubs this spring to bring in more butterflies i have jays finches swallows a bunch of other birds i cant identity hummingbirds monarchs and mantises back there now and a possum that drives my dog nuts theres a hummingbird that lives year round in my neighbors yucca tree that abuts our dividing fence and he keeps all the other hummingbirds that come to feed in check hes kind of a dick but i love him when i go clean the feeders he zooms down and hovers right in my face like hes telling me i better bring that right back sorry i love my yard spaces theyre so soothing to me glad to find other like minded people
DIY,not_removed,agreed bamboo is tough as hell and its able to be turned into quite the flooring product
DIY,not_removed,they have thin almost no space between then or it looked like it i dislike grout cleaning
DIY,not_removed,the fact that more people dont turn their entire lawn into a garden baffles me
DIY,not_removed,i am more baffled about people around the world that live in a desert hey there is at least km to the nearest source of water nothing grows here and there are no animals around and it is hot as hell guys i think this is a sweet spot for a village it is like if they did think life was easy and got reincarnated in hard mode edit i love how many comments on this one forget no water in km range not even ground wells and we talking about real sandy desert not arid land and thumbleweeds
DIY,not_removed,because my kid doesnt want to kick a ball around in a rock pile
DIY,not_removed,lawns were actually started by nobility to basically say look i got all this land and i dont need to use aaaaaaany of it for food so really just rich people waving around their dicks lawns are actually really stupid in the grande scheme of things tbh
DIY,not_removed,man oh man you hit the nail on the head matey i love my lawn but i certainly do not use a precious resource such as water to keep it greener than the others no time for that
DIY,not_removed,well youre in luck because bragging about not having a lawn is so hot right now you cant even post a photo on reddit without diptards fishing for karma with dae hate lawns posts
DIY,not_removed,getoffmylawn
DIY,not_removed,its because you dont have a lawn of your own i guess you cant just let vegetation grow wild it invades the rest of your neighborhood pissing everyone off it looks like shit and reduces home values pissing everyone off all kinds of wild vermin will start living and shitting there right before they move into your house and then the neighbors houses pissing them off of course it never gets this bad because eventually all the pissed off people sneak over to your place and soak it all in turpentine and then salt it while your gone then your topsoil dries up and blows away leaving you with a inch basin of clay which fills up with water and floods your house every time it drizzles dont be a lazy dumbass plant grass its low maintenance has great roots comes back from all kinds of neglect is cheap and looks nice when you take care of it
DIY,not_removed,it looks better just like any person does by keeping good hygiene
DIY,not_removed,nah thats just what the midwest looks like
DIY,not_removed,when your lawn looks like that you typically take pride in it and enjoy it source loving mowing my lawn
DIY,not_removed,its actually only an acre the picture is a little deceiving so not too bad all in all
DIY,not_removed,when you have a decent yard youll generally end up with at least a selfpropelled mower if not a riding lawn tractor the time investment to just mow it isnt too bad usually something like a couple hours at worst every other week or if youre uber into your yard youll get a gang reel mower for that golf courselike finish
DIY,not_removed,but brawndos got what plants crave
DIY,not_removed,i agree with you on the artificial grass i think real grass would be better but the entire question i was answering was why dont more people have non grass yards and use natural plants and the answer is because they look like shit unless you really plan and design it out and do it correctly to do that costs a lot of money grass is easier and cheaper so most people have grass your last question is like asking why have a house at all if you cant afford luxury finishes
DIY,not_removed,damn i never knew those are what tequila is made out of even longer for those x year distilled bottles crazy
DIY,not_removed,is there a vibration mode
DIY,not_removed,thats awesome
DIY,not_removed,cool
DIY,not_removed,if its the lowest part of your basement any water will still flow to it you may have a damp floor but at least you wont have standing water which is a huge problem get a big dehumidifier and have that drain into the sump pit it will help keep your floor dry
DIY,not_removed,if youre feeling ambitious you could trench a network of french drain like trenches throughout your basement that would then be filled with gravelweeping tile and drain in to your sump pit these would collect water and probably bring your moisture level down
DIY,not_removed,if you really want a dry basement hire a professional im not trying to be an ass but this isnt really diy territory doing it properly means digging around the entire perimeter of your basement and installing drain tile then connecting that to the pitpump then there are waterproof systems for the walls
DIY,not_removed,water will still drain through the clay eventually it is too bad there is no gravel under your floor for a drainage base but you can still deal with this i would dig down as far as possible even get a manual post hole digger in there it would be nice to see if you could get a plastic gallon drum with the bottom perforated in there with the lid at floor level fill up about the bottom foot of this with a coarse gravel for around you can get a sump pump to put in the hole with a float assembly plumbing it to the sewer is straight forward be sure and use a foot valve inline good luck this should be ok for just preventative maintenance
DIY,not_removed,code is to have a crock or sump and add a pump in it to pump the water up and out of the basement
DIY,not_removed,how about reservoir and sump pump
DIY,not_removed,good point i guess the next best thing to perfectly dry basement is no standing water
DIY,not_removed,yeah i hear you not really interested in more interested in and diy its an old cheap house
DIY,not_removed,ok good info already have a gallon basin a wayne sump pump and check valve is that a foot valve
DIY,not_removed,yes it is just slang wording where i worked good luck if this area floods because of low water tables i probably wouldnt drill holes in your drum though on second thought it would be terrible to come home and find the basement flooded because of the system you worked so hard to install back fill and compact around the tub as normal and use a hydrolic concrete mix to top it off to lid level this mix will not crack and seals much better to older concrete good luck hope i could help
DIY,not_removed,just installed a sump in indiana in a year old house with almost nothing but clay under the concrete before the sump i came home after a full couple days of heavy rain and inches of water in my basement lots of heavy rain after the pump install and no water in the basement listen to op check your code though in my area we cant tie sump drainage into sewage
DIY,not_removed,agreed that you should not perforate the basin unless youre surrounding the basin in peastone encased in filter fabric that clay will ruin your pump and your discharge pipe
DIY,not_removed,yep but was more worried about letting water into the basement through the perforation holes rather than keeping it out with this sump system just keep it sealed with no drainage

DIY,not_removed,gcfi protection is generally considered okay for replacing a outlet with a outlet that isnt actually grounded so it should be fine please not i am not an electrician surge protectors dont really do anything unless theyre grounded though but i dont know anything about wholehome surge protectors so maybe the central surge protector is grounded even though the outlets are not id talk to your home inspector to ask these questions and ask if the outlets are up to code they might not be
DIY,not_removed,a surge suppressor will protect electronic equipment not you a lot of whole house suppressors are crap the ground is for your protection if the outlets are three pin but are ungrounded that is dangerous and whoever did it ought to be pilloried in the town square a licensed electrician needs to be consulted they can advise you on how to proceed gfi protection is good but is not a substitute for grounding
DIY,not_removed,electrician here are your boxes metal or plastic if they are metal and piped there is a possibility of drilling and tapping a ground to the box itself
DIY,not_removed,you need an electrician prong outlets with no ground is a big deal either the person doing the job did not have a clue or worse they did and were intentionally negligent who knows what other nightmares could be hiding you havent purchased the house yet alter your subjects and add an inspection by a licensed electrician if the wiring needs replacement then you will be tearing out a lot of drywall fishing wire might be an option for a couple receptacles but certainly not all the receptacles this is not a diy job hire the electrician
DIY,not_removed,i think ill answer what youre asking you can get away with just adding a ground wire to each outlet easier to just run a while new strand of romex my basic understanding of gfci you still need a ground wire tbh it it were me id run romex to all the outlets hopefully youre on a crawlspace and not shuffling through an attic then again i probably wouldnt even bother and just put arc fault breakers in your panel
DIY,not_removed,same with gfci outlets need grounding to function properly three pronged outlet can be put in the same box qs two pronged ones so even though it looks grounded it may not be consult electrician you are gonna be spending some money here
DIY,not_removed,probably the whole home if all of the outlets arent grounded if youre lucky they can just pull modern wiring through using the old wiring and they wont have to go into your walls very much
DIY,not_removed,i cant say you need a licensed electrician to determine the best course it may need all new wiring or it may just need jumpers in the outlet boxes
DIY,not_removed,code is quite clear about this informed laymen know this that third prong must connect direct to a main breaker box then any appliance short will always trip a breaker that safety ground protects human life does not protect appliances many have so little respect for human life as to replace two prong receptacles with three prong code is quite blunt this can only exist when a gfci is installed either inside a receptacle or by replacing that circuits breaker in a mains board no way around this either a receptacle must be two prong or a ground three wire cable must connect to that receptacle or a gfci must be installed with all receptacles containing a no equipment ground label gfci does not need a ground wire if one understands what a gfci is and does whole house protector is only for protecting appliances even that is not effective if not connected low impedance ie less than meters to earth ground a protector is only as effective as its earth ground earth ground is electrically different from a mains safety ground even though both are interconnected inspector probably used three light tester to detect missing safety grounds first a three light tester can detect defects but it can never say a receptacle is good second a three light tester will never say an earth ground is good or bad note two critically different grounds both must exist for human protection earth ground also provides appliance protection if a whole house protector makes a low impedance ie less than foot connection knowledge now exists to inspect and therefore learn from find each bare copper quarter inch wire that connect to the main breaker box what do each connect to long before getting a licensed electrician first learn these simple concepts that any informed layman know they you are ready for what an electrician recommends
DIY,not_removed,the rewiring process will depend entirely on the house framing and how difficult it would be to fish new romex through the walls i wouldnt be surprised if a new panel needed to be installed as well i would make sure to have this addressed before closing so price adjustments can be made if needed i would personally want the seller to have the work done before i closed to make sure there arent anymore gotchas
DIY,not_removed,i do alot of bath remodels and have a few tips here first off if you have any problems with sheetrock just replace it all use cement board where needed moisture resistant rock elsewhereit uses so little product and is way faster to finish than to patch and match next over power it run a new solo gfci outlet from the panel box now make sure to have an exhaust fan put in they keep mold away lastly use pvc trim around your new vinyl windows to assure no molding rotting or paint peeling for fixtures buy quality you dont want to have to touch them for a decade look at everything you do as something that will not need fixed or replaced for ten years and you will be fine an example i just did i put two gfci outlets on the vanity walls so the lady of the house could use a hair dryer while having two curling irons plugged in without tripping breakers she thought it was a gift from god himself also installed decorator safety bars inside the tub enclosure mounted through to the wall framing for stability we all get old and it gets hard to get out of a tub or deal with slippery tubs when showering its little things like this that make the difference good luck hope this gives you inspiration and some ideas that help
DIY,not_removed,if you are still using a tub no need for tile backer you can use green board and red guard should use red guard anyway as far as the spider cracking it usually a few things that cause that most of the time its moisture the biggest mistake homeowners make is not replacing the exhaust fan get one rated for double the room size
DIY,not_removed,thanks for the tips ill be posting pics when i get at it
DIY,not_removed,i have a decent bath fan its about cfm i believe ill look in to getting a new one perhaps those broan ones with a bluetooth speaker hahah
DIY,not_removed,cool thanks for the tip i will definitely do that instead of mold resistant gypsum

DIY,not_removed,fighting to the death was kind of what i was going for i was looking for something that came in at the right budget but was original and useful enough to make people want it
DIY,not_removed,i have a cheap simple nes controller i got on amazon for a few bucks a while back thats going with it
DIY,not_removed,ill probably add more roms to it before the exchange whoever receives the gift will be the one who needs to get the appropriate usb controllers asis youd only be able to play nes and gameboy games just because im including a single nes controller with it
DIY,not_removed,fighting to the death was kind of what i was going for an elaborate ruse to get your coworkers family or friends to kill one another i love it even more how simple was it to set the software up to run the emulator this inspires me to make one
DIY,not_removed,its incredibly easy first get yourself a raspberry pi or raspberry pi zero a power source a micro sd card some controllers and a usb hub if you get the zero next head over to httpsretropieorguk download the associated build and write it to the micro sd card following the instructions online pop it in start it up and run through your initial configuration you now have an emulator but no games next find your roms insert legal disclaimer of only getting roms for games you are licensed to be able to use stick the roms on a flash drive look up the folder structure you need then stick the flash drive into the running retropie and itll automatically copy the games over
DIY,not_removed,id say your real risk is in the insulation but most houses built in the have plaster walls if your walls are drywall its probable that these were renovated and you might have no issue there are usually a number of local companies that will do asbestos inspection for a fairly reasonable price either way you should at least wear a mask and goggles if you are planning on doing the work yourself proper ventilation of the site is key as well im not an expert but i did stay at a holiday inn express last night

DIY,not_removed,you can by testing sticks on line theyre not cheap being a contractor in ohio if i would run into asbestos that needs to be removed i would need to hire a embankment crew that would demo bag it and disposed of it properly but being a home owner you can demo away and toss in the trash can same thing when dealing with ledbase paint you floor tiles are most likely asbestos i doubt your insulation is that is if you have insulation if its horse hair plaster its asbestos if the plan is to demo out the house yourself to save some money my advice would to invest in a good respirator a no trespassing sign and some heavy duty black bags hd or lowes has them bag all the plaster insulation floor tile and tie the tops of the bags no need to dress up in a space suit or nothing as long as you have the respirator youll be fine make sure you do all your demo after weekends would be better and make sure you put the no trespassing sign on the front door youll be doing this just in case if the local building inspector drives by and sees the dumpster they dont have the right to go on your property because of the dumpster but if they did and took a look in the dumpster all theyll see are a punch of tied up shut black bags have fun

DIY,not_removed,what youre seeing is the exterior sheathing not the siding the only real solution to this is to insulate with batts and then staple tuck tape vapor barrier on the inside best case would be to spray foam it as that gives you insulation and vapor barrier

DIY,not_removed,the link shows a picture of a dog laying on the bed am i missing something here
DIY,not_removed,it looks cool and all but as a pianist of years who cant afford a piano i could only stare at this album with a look of horror on my face
DIY,not_removed,load remaining images nah it looks cool though
DIY,not_removed,as a former piano technician and rebuilder the idea of grinding off the strings was absolutely hysterical i normally just cut them off with wire cutters but to each his own
DIY,not_removed,it would be really badass if you can turn onoff the lights with a key could be a good arduino project
DIY,not_removed,its so cool yet so impractical
DIY,not_removed,havent read the comments but im going to assume youre going to get a lot of flak for destroying a piano im assuming its probably just some old piano that has no value and has probably even warped to the point of no return calm down people theres hundred of these pianos scattered throughout craigslist that are broken beyond repair however if you want to be a people pleaser or even improve your build you could save up and someday buy an electric piano then you could just remove the casing from the electric piano and replace the old keys of your piano with a working electric piano it seems as you have plenty of space after removing all the strings so you could probably even fit speakers in there as well
DIY,not_removed,that came out incredible the lights just takes it up a notch
DIY,not_removed,i need one of these 👌 this is awesome
DIY,not_removed,this really strikes a chord with me as a pianist i was expecting to be upset by the composition but ultimately i must admit its a sharp execution of the idea you obviously put major effort into this and with no staff to help you youre truly an upright citizen
DIY,not_removed,and so ends the tale of how a diy enthusiast instilled fear into the hearts of hundreds of poor pianists in one single post looks good tho man d
DIY,not_removed,thats a furry looking piano
DIY,not_removed,and we really needed pictures to show us that
DIY,not_removed,great idea for repurposing and nice execution i wonder if youll keep the serpentine wine bottle rack for the long haul a minimalist and geometric solution in keeping with the rectangles of the piano structure and the the keys and more importantly allowed walltowall wine would work really well too
DIY,not_removed,ive had an idea for a burning man art car for years basically take your idea here but the keys are removed and an electronic key board is sunk it its place then id put the whole thing up on a trailer and haul it around playing music and handing out free drinks when you ripped it open was it pretty easy i mean no special tools or skills required right just basics and a grinder
DIY,not_removed,as a musicianthis is like watching a baby get destroyed
DIY,not_removed,i really like your idea the steps seem pretty simple
DIY,not_removed,thats awesome if the wife or i drank id totally do this to her piano
DIY,not_removed,awww man i would have taken that piano and rehabbed it i mean enjoy your wine bar but as a musician im hurting a little bit
DIY,not_removed,what a waste
DIY,not_removed,thats a dog
DIY,not_removed,same im very confused
DIY,not_removed,whatever youre using to view reddit doesnt seem to notice the difference between httpsimgurcomgallerymxlsb and httpsiimgurcommxlsbpng
DIY,not_removed,same
DIY,not_removed,as a former piano player for years i can also say that there are used pos pianos everywhere you can often get them on cl for free because they are so painful to move water damage warping cheap manufacturing heat damage on and on salvaging a piano is often way more than its worth making these kinds of projects ok esp when it gives a piano a second life
DIY,not_removed,most pianos are free if you can move them ive gotten a few over the years that way
DIY,not_removed,if it makes you feel any better i did research on the piano to make sure i wasnt destroying a valuable model also go on craigslist a lot of people give them away for free as long as you can remove it from the property thats how i got this old girl
DIY,not_removed,check out craigslist free for all youll find at least or at any given time
DIY,not_removed,go on craigslist if theres anything like it where you live free upright pianos all over the place i have one im trying to get rid of now cant seem to give it away
DIY,not_removed,so i take it youre going to run out and get a piano now since you can get them for free right why do i have the feeling you still wont get one
DIY,not_removed,it hurts my heart i hate to see the death of any instrument
DIY,not_removed,i agree i get that it was free and old but its a piano it hurts my heart another piano neer again to play beautiful music neer again to serenade a proud parent nor to help win the heart of a young mans beloved goodnight sweet prince
DIY,not_removed,same here and i dont even play piano
DIY,not_removed,yeah i suck and didnt log into imgur before uploading and unless im missing something very possible theres no way for me to edit the contents of the album if i uploaded with no username attached i was going to trim the fat on the shit pictures after i uploaded them but i cant figure it out sorry for all the excess
DIY,not_removed,grinding them off would be insanely easier yet obviously very sloppy and dangerous hence why youd probably never do such a thing if youre actually trying to repair it
DIY,not_removed,that worked for about half of them but the thicker strings were hard to snap the cutters i used were also very old and dull
DIY,not_removed,exactly what i was thinking huge piece of furniture just to hold what looks like bottles and glasses still cool though if you got the space
DIY,not_removed,alcoholic finds new ways to make his disease more classy the onion
DIY,not_removed,i think you meant to post that on imgur
DIY,not_removed,you could make due with basic tools and a grinder but having the right tools made it easier and it was still a pain in the ass find one with as much room as possible for inlaying the keyboard the one i had access to had room for extra stuff
DIY,not_removed,pretty sure a piano sitting unused gathering dust in someones hallway is more of a waste you realize there are insane numbers of free pianos up for grabs on craigslist right want mine
DIY,not_removed,relay here cute dog
DIY,not_removed,relay here too and cute dog
DIY,not_removed,relay i see a dog
DIY,not_removed,relay dog
DIY,not_removed,can confirm great aunt passed away years ago and while cleaning out her house i had the duties of keeping the piano at my house we didnt think the piano was worth anything but its the piano my mom learned to play on needless to say its still sitting at my old house and probably will be for a while
DIY,not_removed,piano murderer
DIY,not_removed,i see them go for cheap to free all the time so youre probably saving it from the dump and looks badass
DIY,not_removed,if you were my facebook friend id unfriend you
DIY,not_removed,even bagpipes
DIY,not_removed,no no the piece is beautiful very impressive im just a lazy shit
DIY,not_removed,what is the wavy wine shelf material
DIY,not_removed,where you at
DIY,not_removed,its a dog
DIY,not_removed,nice job but i would still keep the piano it would have been awesome if the piano would still work so the wine could age properly with some classical music that is if you play well
DIY,not_removed,if youve ever suffered in the home of someone perpetually learning to play piano then youd understand that its more like a mercy killing
DIY,not_removed,you my friend have never heard the uilleann pipe unlike the highlands pipes they are beautiful and melodic
DIY,not_removed,wood i got a shelf on amazon and took it apart to stick it in there
DIY,not_removed,colorado
DIY,not_removed,im classically trained piano player ive been performing since i was ill play for free wine or any type of payment also i can say that piano is pretty much worthless and is probably worth more now that its a wine bar actually really wish they would have kept it playable though wouldve made it really unique and awesome
DIY,not_removed,ty anyway
DIY,not_removed,i wanted to replace the keys with a electric since there was definitely no way to keep it acoustic with the harp taking up so much room but it wasnt in the budget
DIY,not_removed,good luck
DIY,not_removed,i may not know what im talking about but i think this is worth considering if its just wax and not some other substance chemically bonded to the stone then i would ask can the stone be easily removed if so then why not turn it upside down heat the stain with a heat gun seems like the wax would just melt and drip off
DIY,not_removed,well my only suggestion would be to wax the rest of the patio to match hopefully it doesnt come to that also what about acid etching
DIY,not_removed,power washer
DIY,not_removed,out of curiosity did you try a desiccant like damprid leaving it on putting plastic in top taping it down and hoping it absorbed the oil just curious ive never done it
DIY,not_removed,maybe some sort of torchburn it off
DIY,not_removed,i love the commitment and the well documented follow up but i gotta sayits a paving stone the others will get wine or grease on them too and its irritating the first time but long term no one will notice
DIY,not_removed,thats what i am thinking a light pressure targeted at the edge of the wax should peel it nicely
DIY,not_removed,nope youre the first to suggest it maybe that will be our final experiment
DIY,not_removed,somebody else had suggested that and we got very strong dont go there messages back from the makers of the paving stones they have a special hardened coating on the top and the heat differential would make them crack
DIY,not_removed,thats actually pretty awesome good for you
DIY,not_removed,thats so sweet and kudos on making it able to carry the cooler on the back smart use of space
DIY,not_removed,it is like an adult stroller
DIY,not_removed,i love this one of my kids is a wheelchair user im saving this for future reverence

DIY,not_removed,use some cardboard and duct tape maybe i have done it in a pinch before also i just found this and it looks interesting httpibnetcomblogsiphonedocumentscannerjpg
DIY,not_removed,thanks
DIY,not_removed,no problem happy to help
DIY,not_removed,i am first going to suggest that you do not attempt to reinvent the wheel since you have limited tools i suggest buying some premade tops those are solid oak they come in in both and foot lengths buy two and join them together with a biscuit joiner and pocket screws both are easy for the diyer and will provide a solid surface that will last for many years dont beat yourself up trying to make your own counter top it can be done and is very satisfying but it is a lot of work
DIY,not_removed,be careful of the quality at lumber liquidators make certain your getting what you think you are make certain you are buying real wood and not a composite substance made with off gassing chemicals ie cyanide formaldehyde etc ll has had some bad problems in recent years with epa issues dealing with materials made in china
DIY,not_removed,wow thanks for the gold never happened to me before
DIY,not_removed,but that also takes out all the pain and suffering ya know stuff i can hold over my wife when i need another beer and she is closer to the fridge
DIY,not_removed,the more i look at it the more i will probably just buy one lumber liquidators has some good prices as well
DIY,not_removed,awesome advice thank you very much

DIY,not_removed,you didnt use pallets gonna have to downvote ha i kid i kid this looks awesome good work
DIY,not_removed,great execution the wall looks great however im not sure if thats too much wood going on theres the dark wood laminate at the entry and the perpendicular lighter hardwood thought the room and then now the plank wall maybe its just me though
DIY,not_removed,sweet where did you get that big us map i want one like that for my office
DIY,not_removed,this looks amazing op just curious what you did with the end grain on the side wall as well as the plywood edge what did you cover it with
DIY,not_removed,great job wall beautification always enhances the look of room i liked your color combination that red door is absolutely matching with the wooden style walls
DIY,not_removed,nice job on the wall i like it dont think the finish was overkill at all really makes it look professionally done now time to do something about that front door and red wall not a fan of the maroon door with red wall and stained glass door insert real cuckoo clock my grandparents brought one of those back from germany years ago
DIY,not_removed,wheres the joke here im new to this sub lol
DIY,not_removed,thanks before i built it i considered all of the wood clashing i know this doesnt do it much justice over the internet but its worth mentioning even with the juxtaposition of wood the home does flow together quite nicely as a whole the wood pieces ive built and installed over the years have begun to complement each other as you make your way through the home httpimgurcomaxjyfu httpimgurcomaptafd httpimgurcomaamlkk yes its a lot but the house as whole flows well edit fixed links
DIY,not_removed,httpwwwnatgeomapscomwallmapsreferencemapsunitedstatesunitedstatesexecutiveenlarged
DIY,not_removed,at the moment ive left it exposed stained the ends and underlayment doesnt look too bad if it bugs me enough ill throw one of over the corner
DIY,not_removed,cuckoo clock is very german and very real i agree wholeheartedly on the walldoor color fiasco luckily painting is easy
DIY,not_removed,i disagree im no color expert but i think the red wall fits really well kind of makes the plank wall stand out and attract attention to it it makes the place feel warm and cozy and definietly plainproofs it the door is kinda funky tho
DIY,not_removed,lumber was somewhere around the wood is a mix of and common board from home depot
DIY,not_removed,ive seen a few accent walls built with pallets there are many things built with pallets pallets and diy go hand in hand haha i meant no offense i still think this is awesome
DIY,not_removed,sweet those are awesome i can remember them winding the thing up by pulling those wooden handles down every day i traveled through germany a couple of years ago on the way to turkey and almost bought one in munich i think i was concerned with it getting damaged on the way back and had already bought a ton of shit in turkeyanyways i digress you may resume your beer run lol
DIY,not_removed,im ok with the walljust not the wall and the door at the same time red wall maroon door black belt brown pantsmaybe worse
DIY,not_removed,i like the red with the wood just fine but the door needs swapped out that stained glass is awful maybe next project will be a custom wood door
DIY,not_removed,wearing a hoodie and shorts
DIY,not_removed,
DIY,not_removed,socks and sandals
DIY,not_removed,you be respecting me and my middle europe
DIY,not_removed,socks and sandals are not ok in middle europe the middle east the midwest middle earthlol
DIY,not_removed,yes you are correct it is less than perfect help me out please there are two ways to go you can continue to try to get the responsible parties to do their respective jobs there is no excuse this hammering in of shims is only to appease you they really dont care if the beam is not supporting the weight worst case for you eventually the floor above will sink until it is resting on the beam you may notice a dip in the floor and perhaps some doors on the floor above wont close properly but the house will not fall down or you can fix this yourself it will cost you less than and it will be fixed to your satisfaction is this a possibility if so go to your local big box store and buy some hardwood cedar is not really hard but it resists rot pretty damn good i personally would look for some teak or other hardwood that is rot resistant you could also use plate steel but its not so easy to cut then id put it on the table saw and cut some shims out of it id make them a of an inch maybe an of an inch taller than the void i was trying to fill then id get a floor jack for a car or truck id get a piece of scrap x and cut it to size then id place the jack beneath the floor next to the beam id start jacking up the floor to open the space between the beam and the floor id slide the shim in there and then drop the floor back on top of it to do this right using a level on the floor above would insure that youve created a shim of the correct thickness you could install a thicker or thinner piece as the level dictates shouldnt take you too long maybe two beers and it would be done and you can get on with your life your call of course

DIY,not_removed,thanks a ton ended up getting word back from the seller through my realtor that theyre willing to jack it up and shim properly i think it would formally require an engineer approval but not sure if completely necessary due to the small gap it has i had a civilgeo friend of mine take a look at the lot itself and didnt see any major foundation issues so i think well be satisfied as long as it is properly shimmed funny thing is that this hammer shim is what their engineer friend suggested and he entirely said to avoid jacking it not sure why
DIY,not_removed,jacking creates more problems if there is tile flooring you are going to crack the grout loose or break the tile adhesion near wallsthis is the sheetrock may crack along the mid tape joints and ceiling joint if you do jack it up do minimally just enough to add shims no more also i would never use a metal shim in a crawl space it will rust nailing is useless as sheer weight load will hold the shim and nails will split them buy a few cedar shingles from a roofing supplier they come in widths up to inches and are tapered from about inch to zero good luck
DIY,not_removed,thanks for the input i wish there was some consensus on this type of stuff but i guess thats where the engineer comes into play jack it dont jack it nailing

DIY,not_removed,what sort of things will you be using the sink for ie will you be rinsing anything down it that would be potentially toxic you could attach the drain to something like an ibc tote and use the grey water for irrigating garden beds or similar that way you can spread the watering out by collecting it while the sink is in use and slowly dripping out all of the time
DIY,not_removed,google septic system drain fields some are as simple as perforated and wrapped drain pipe have home made a few of these with gallon buckets pipe and some serious shovel time although not code they have been effective
DIY,not_removed,assuming the soil isnt clay or already saturated id go with some sort of drywell minutes a day cant be more than and is probably quite a bit less than gallons
DIY,not_removed,french drain if youre not gonna dump chemicals down the sink

DIY,not_removed,google diy moon sand
DIY,not_removed,with no place to put flame decals how do you expect this to ever go really fast
DIY,not_removed,lol the hands
DIY,not_removed,you should contact braille skateboarding they have a series on their youtube channel called you make it we skate it this board looks sweet and id love to see an episode where they ride one of these things at the skatepark
DIY,not_removed,to resolve the glue issue use a lowviscosity twopart epoxy like httpwwwwestsystemcomss
DIY,not_removed,looks like theres a lot of flex in there probably what worked the glue joints loose is that desirable for a board
DIY,not_removed,i wish i had a solidworks license i could use at home i always see diy people using sketchup but as a solidworks user i find the idea of going back to nonparametric cad horrifying
DIY,not_removed,i like the idea with the serrated edges but actual griptape would still work way better imo i wonder if the deck has any pop to it or if you need hulk legs for flat ground tricks really cool project
DIY,not_removed,looks cool but probably would snap in half very quickly
DIY,not_removed,would you be interested in selling the files for this id love to cut one of these out
DIY,not_removed,well done any pics of that honeycomb board that looked cool also i appreciate your ability to make a reasonable video with reasonable loop a sir seems lightweight enough to flex but heavy enough to kick flip a bit
DIY,not_removed,this will be cross posted to rtifu in a couple of days
DIY,not_removed,cool project do you have any info on your home brew laser cutter
DIY,not_removed,yeah do a kick flip off a stair now im sure that will work out for ya
DIY,not_removed,i see the rca dog in the thumbnail
DIY,not_removed,does this have some performance advantage or is it just for looks
DIY,not_removed,have fun landing primo
DIY,not_removed,it looks cool but seems unnecessarily dangerous its probably easier to break and depending on how you land from a higher jump you are more likely to get into a nasty fall if your toes get stuck inbetween
DIY,not_removed,tell me more about your homebrew laser cutter
DIY,not_removed,forget the skateboard how do i build the homebrew laser cutter
DIY,not_removed,im confused this post is hours old and no pictures of a shattered board yet
DIY,not_removed,what wood did you use and what glue if this is mentioned somewhere im sorry i missed it in any case you might want to let the glue dry longer before you stress it titebond recommends hours i believe so you might not have gotten it at maximum strength if you just left it overnight
DIY,not_removed,but does it kickflip
DIY,not_removed,is it pretty lightweight it seems like that would be pretty convenient if so
DIY,not_removed,next time use titebond iii or epoxy youll bet sturdier joints and theyll be waterproof
DIY,not_removed,the best part of the video was that sick grind you have mad hand skills
DIY,not_removed,im glad to see you didnt push mongo
DIY,not_removed,wouldnt this lead to structural weakness compared to a board with more material
DIY,not_removed,but does it skate tho
DIY,not_removed,primo
DIY,not_removed,op would you be so kind as to share design files
DIY,not_removed,lol at the tricks at the end
DIY,not_removed,how does laser cutting affect the structural integrity of the wood i know if this was milled cut microscopic stress cuts can form all along the wood weakening the end product
DIY,not_removed,do a flip
DIY,not_removed,first troiyyyy
DIY,not_removed,cool looking but id like to see some failure point data compared to a standard maple ply deck im a form after function kinda guy and i can see that board leading to a real nasty booboo
DIY,not_removed,but what happens when you hit primo
DIY,not_removed,now do a darkslide
DIY,not_removed,id be worried your toes would get caught on it
DIY,not_removed,lets see you ollie down a set of stairs on it now
DIY,not_removed,first try
DIY,not_removed,shits got pop
DIY,not_removed,clean the cubeimirite
DIY,not_removed,til i need a lasercutter
DIY,not_removed,im more interested in your laser cutter build do you have a plan that you followed
DIY,not_removed,i skipped to the end of the video hoping to see someone throw kickflip or smt pleasantly surprised
DIY,not_removed,i design and burn projects like this all the timeand that came out pretty nice i run a much larger laser at work but still same principle you are much more advanced in solid works i use a version of cad designed for my industry i see many of your problems cutting are things i perfected over the years mostly things like adjusting kerf focus and velocity so it will always cut through the board the reason your wood was under its because it was in mm i tend to add an offset of on all interlocking parts for a nice fit your beam thickness may be thinner though and need more or less nice job
DIY,not_removed,pic is begging to be made into a httpwwwredditcomrcinemagraphs
DIY,not_removed,you make it we skate it
DIY,not_removed,are the schematics available to make the board id like to make this as a gift
DIY,not_removed,send one to braille skateboarding for their skate everything on youtube
DIY,not_removed,tries to ollie no surface for pop looks like idiot breaks after first landing awesome day
DIY,not_removed,i thought i read that you made the laser if you did what kind did you build
DIY,not_removed,so is this board better than a regular skateboard lighter or did you just want to cut stuff with a laser
DIY,not_removed,for the love of god please do a build log tutorial for the laser cutter ive been dreaming of building one but have never pulled everything together
DIY,not_removed,as novel as the teeth idea is for grip they will get work down pretty quickly i suspect
DIY,not_removed,nice i wanna build a laser cutter now
DIY,not_removed,kick flip first try
DIY,not_removed,httpshirtwootcomofferssciencerules
DIY,not_removed,you should send to this braille
DIY,not_removed,braille needs this
DIY,not_removed,you should send that to will it skate on youtube they skate all kinds of things that people send in
DIY,not_removed,cool but on the first jump its done for
DIY,not_removed,the braille video of this board just went up on youtube an hour ago
DIY,not_removed,did you sent it to braille
DIY,not_removed,thats fun what a cool project with how thick the pieces are youd have tons of support a couple questions did it feel lighter than a normal skateboard did it have any pop can you do a flipkicker p for those that dont skate this is a joke
DIY,not_removed,any plans to sell these id love to buy a kit containing just the parts stain and assemble everything myself if youre interested in doing a one off let me know id pick one up for my quiver
DIY,not_removed,yoooo this is sick i would love to ride something like this sometime how light is it i bet its super light
DIY,not_removed,did you think about making a board from veneers then laser cutting that it would be stronger also i can understand bracing it straight across but why did you choose that over diagonal bracing across the strips
DIY,not_removed,send this to braille they will jizz
DIY,not_removed,theres a youtube series called you make it we skate it maybe you should check it out
DIY,not_removed,this belongs on you build it we skate it youtube channel
DIY,not_removed,utheshortwalk you should send this to brailleskateboardingcoms youtube channel they have a show you make it we skate it this could be awesome show
DIY,not_removed,first trrrrryyyyyyyyyyyyy
DIY,not_removed,so you made a un rideable and useless board but why
DIY,not_removed,
DIY,not_removed,poser
DIY,not_removed,rshittydiy woops the glue started coming undone
DIY,not_removed,upvote just for firing your laser
DIY,not_removed,probably not a good starter board what if the board breaks and stabs you in the ribs
DIY,not_removed,i feel like that would break in the first use
DIY,not_removed,why the fuck would you want to do this
DIY,not_removed,gee another first i built an industrial laser
DIY,not_removed,thats not diy thats just stupid no wait special stupid
DIY,not_removed,i expect it to break easily
DIY,not_removed,it is not even red
DIY,not_removed,and whats your scientific basis for thinking that
DIY,not_removed,so how would adding more stickers make you go faster
DIY,not_removed,that took me a second to see in case anyone else is wondering the movie magic is that they used hands in shoes for that grind
DIY,not_removed,im a year old dude whos never skated i cant stop watching these guys im thinking of getting a board when i saw him skating in the gifs i was like kick flip it first trieyyyyyy weird how much i enjoy them
DIY,not_removed,i was gonna comment exactly this the submission email address is contactbrailleskateboardingcom thatd be so fun to see although its almost a certainty that theyd break the board
DIY,not_removed,are these the guys that rode the glass board that was fucking insane
DIY,not_removed,i second this they can ride and flip everything
DIY,not_removed,i watch these guys given their track record this will last ten seconds
DIY,not_removed,ill third this and ill add they are very generous when it comes to their shoutouts especially in their you make it we skate it series
DIY,not_removed,i actually just subscribed to these fools they are pretty interesting to watch seen this year old go bananas in the bowl
DIY,not_removed,haha wow when i read the headline on the front page my only thought was its just another video from braille
DIY,not_removed,so its like the skateboard version of every third thursday i guess i have a new series to binge thanks
DIY,not_removed,i dont skate am almost and really enjoy that channel it just looks so fun
DIY,not_removed,yes exactly i dont know why i am subbed to their channel i dont know anything about skating but its entertaining that board would snap so fast though xd
DIY,not_removed,i love when braille gives new shoes decks or completes to someone in need edit too much useless nonsense
DIY,not_removed,the braille video of this board just went up on youtube an hour ago
DIY,not_removed,dude
DIY,not_removed,fuck that glass skateboard episode made me cringe so hard he was literally millimeters away from slicing his a achilles in half i havent watched it since because it reminds me of what could have been
DIY,not_removed,this seems to be the unpopular opinion on reddit but man i hate that channel and other channels like it youtube skaters the type with minute videos with minutes of skating are cancer im not a fan of the mainstream skate scene also aaron kyro is a tool how can he call himself a pro his parts are manuals
DIY,not_removed,they will destroy your boardbut the karma
DIY,not_removed,heh yea they are badass
DIY,not_removed,yeah bowi do that for shure
DIY,not_removed,there is absolutely no way this thing would hold up to hardcore skating or even basic tricks like an ollie
DIY,not_removed,came here to suggest this
DIY,not_removed,seconded
DIY,not_removed,i wonder if lashing it with artificial sinew like is done with skin on frame boats would work the idea there is you cant stop the joints from moving and the artificial sinew gives a little slip the stresses in a skateboard are probably different but the design looks surprisingly similar
DIY,not_removed,hell put a a carbon fiber skin on it while youre at it
DIY,not_removed,agreed came to say the same
DIY,not_removed,some flex is good a rigid board is not comfortable the lack of torsional stiffness on this board isnt great i think the real issue is glue doesnt stick well to laser cut edges overall the board rides fine but i never expected it to outperform a real skateboard deck
DIY,not_removed,i know that is a skateboard and not a longboard but my longboard has much more flex than that i can touch the ground when i jump on it
DIY,not_removed,fusion has been a god send i suggest checking it out for a free alternative
DIY,not_removed,i think you can piggy back a home license of solidworks assuming you have a legitimate seat at your company
DIY,not_removed,if you work for a company that has seats of solidworks there are home use licenses as well essentially a standalone key for each seat meant for that user to have on a home machine talk to your solidworks admin the documentation for the home use licenses pretty much says that the purpose of having your designers install solidworks at home is so they dont spend company time on personal projects
DIY,not_removed,inventor is easier to get for home use
DIY,not_removed,look into onshape its pretty fantastic i was opposed to the idea of an online cad tool but this one has been awesome
DIY,not_removed,the first actual trick they do not jumping straight up and down inches off of it is going to shatter it and send pieces into their legs scrotum and anus i hope they film it
DIY,not_removed,i was worried about that but the board is stronger than it looks theres a gif in the album where i jump on it
DIY,not_removed,nah it looks like its times thicker than a normal skateboard normal skateboards break super easy source broke a skateboard a week in my teens
DIY,not_removed,when i make an improved version
DIY,not_removed,the honeycomb board is great it makes all sorts of weird crinkling noises
DIY,not_removed,not yet ive been documenting the entire build though one day ill finish it i can give you specs laser air assist inch cutting area motorized z axis smoothieboard cnc controller
DIY,not_removed,i just wanted to laser cut every part it performs worse than a standard board
DIY,not_removed,google lasersaur
DIY,not_removed,birch plywood and titebond which dried for maybe hours looking at the joints i think the glue ripped a thin layer off the charred edges
DIY,not_removed,strips are thick tall its pounds lm not a real skateboarder soon im going to give the board to somebody who can actually skate to see what they think
DIY,not_removed,maybe it needs some work before id be comfortable with that
DIY,not_removed,less than the cad model says but i havent actually measured it
DIY,not_removed,easier to laser cut i may put a polycarbonate skin over the top to stiffen it
DIY,not_removed,while ops looks cool its definitely far better to just laminate your own board ikea skatebords are not the future d same with laser cutting it sounds cool but cnc routers like the shopbot make better structural components faster and cleaner
DIY,not_removed,hah titebond most of the glue joints are charred laser cut edges ill make a new board and sand those edges clean
DIY,not_removed,seen you post this too many times
DIY,not_removed,why isnt it a diy
DIY,not_removed,rdiwhy
DIY,not_removed,this grinds my gears
DIY,not_removed,im
DIY,not_removed,red is faster
DIY,not_removed,everyone knows the red ones go faster you git
DIY,not_removed,for those down voting you httpstheinfosphereorgtherouteofallevilquotes
DIY,not_removed,httpstheinfosphereorgtherouteofallevilquotes
DIY,not_removed,it looked off but i dont think i would have realized what was happening without these two comments
DIY,not_removed,and all the subsequent tricks lol
DIY,not_removed,do it man never to old myself and just picking it up again got a mini ramp at my local park the braille vids are great for learning they get some hate in the community but fuck em they make good informative videos and have fun skating while giving back to the sport thats what its really all about man
DIY,not_removed,do it im i started skating at and i am terrible at it still fun as hell
DIY,not_removed,im never skated before but after google shared their glass skateboard video on facebook i couldnt stop watching them either i might even end up trying
DIY,not_removed,im i bought a board for the first time in years last month
DIY,not_removed,hey bro im and never skateboarded before days ago i saw your comment here and it encouraged me to buy a board i went online and shopped around and bought two skateboards been skating around ever since can almost ollie d thanks for the encouragement
DIY,not_removed,i bought a longboard after a few weeks of binge watching their videos hoping to be balanced enough by next summer to get on the skateboard
DIY,not_removed,do it i thought i was old but i asked my friends who skated to show me its super fun and honestly its like going to the gym you skate for yourself and not for others so dont worry what people think
DIY,not_removed,i think the submission address for you make it we skate it is skateitbrailleskateboardingcom see for example the description of video anyway i dont think the address matters that much so long as you get the board to them
DIY,not_removed,thats what i dont like about these guys some of those boards are so unique and awesome but they just end up destroying them i would of definetly saved the glass and carbon boards but then i guess they wouldnt have a show
DIY,not_removed,yup thats them
DIY,not_removed,theyd break it in half in minutes
DIY,not_removed,they would break it while opening the box they use a drill a fucking drill
DIY,not_removed,that kid which gives me hope
DIY,not_removed,nowhere near as professional though
DIY,not_removed,i subbed because they skated the gold play button
DIY,not_removed,i can understand why you might not like them but regardless they have manage to make a lot of people interested in skating i think the appeal is they are super average and a lot of people can relate especially with lance seems like he started skating not too long ago and so a lot of people think if he can do it i can watching a lot pro videos can be intimidating especially when its skaters with elitist attitudes these guys are the average joes just having fun just read the amount of comments in this thread alone where people have credited braille videos for sparking their interest in learning to skate i think is pretty cool tbh even if they are annoying
DIY,not_removed,i used to skate about years ago their channel just reminds me of how much fun it was to just go skate with your friends and have a good time i actually decided to get back into skating and bought a new board a couple months ago because of these guys i love watching actual pro skaters and legit pro skating movies but i dont feel like braille and other youtube skaters are cancer as you call it them theyre just out skating and having a good time which was always what it was about for me at least
DIY,not_removed,if only there were an arrow shaped button that you could click to mirror this sentiment and eliminate the need for commentary
DIY,not_removed,this solution fits the look as well but seems like its a skilled labor timeintensive solution
DIY,not_removed,you carbon fibre advocates are everywhere personally id stick with the wood finish probably oiled or waxed
DIY,not_removed,second this would look awesome
DIY,not_removed,on another note do you have plans for the laser cutter or was there a set that you followed to make yours
DIY,not_removed,from looking at it it looks like your joint where the trucks the meet the wood isnt solid enough when youre riding theres going to be more force on the outside ribs due to foot positioning than the inside ones it looks like the only thing providing resistance to those forces is the nose cap and its too far away from the pivot point and too thin to really do much i could be completely off base here im only going by a computer model and a couple gifs
DIY,not_removed,you have to brush or sand off the char from the laser glue wont stick to it at all you can use a variety of different glues but something like gorilla glue will have enough flex to stay together under heavy vibration
DIY,not_removed,i suggest some coarse sandpaper work at the joints like or should roughen up the surface enough for the glue to hold rock steady
DIY,not_removed,use part epoxy and then resin coat the whole thing itll probably be way stronger and more durable composite materials are only as strong as the binder that holds them together wood glue is a composite wood glue is shit
DIY,not_removed,what glue did you use im sure there theres an adhesive that will stick and be strong enough after all they build racing cars with glue they call it structural adhesive though used with carbon fiber composites perhaps a friendly redditor who knows their glues has a recommendation for you some kind of epoxy perhaps
DIY,not_removed,aye if you made your laser cutter you can make a cnc router the glue glue itself to the soot and not the wood youd have to sand with a dremel or do the whole thing with a router
DIY,not_removed,did you score the edges after the laser cutting
DIY,not_removed,ive used a bit but i find it a lot less intuitive than solidworks especially when it comes to assemblies or maybe im just used to the way solidworks does things though i find nx to be far more similar to how im used to doing things in solidworks than i also tried using onshape for a bit which i found to be a lot closer to solidworks but they changed their file policy a while back limiting the number of active and private files so i stopped using it
DIY,not_removed,apparently the home usage license no longer exists according to my cursory google search
DIY,not_removed,yeah ill have to look into that do you know offhand autodesks license policy for hobbyistnoncommercial use last i checked it was only free for students im not a big fan of either
DIY,not_removed,i have tried it liked the tool do not like their file policy edit for their free service
DIY,not_removed,i really doubt it would shatter though id like to try it out maybe id even land a treflip
DIY,not_removed,have you ollied it
DIY,not_removed,about off the board thats nowhere near the force that thing is going to get when doing a trick
DIY,not_removed,thats why i bought mini logos
DIY,not_removed,i guarantee this thing wouldnt last an hour if i skated it there is absolutely no way it holds up to a board slide the first trick you land with your feet off the bolts and that boards snaps
DIY,not_removed,real skateboards are not single piece boards and are build to withstand tons of weight and pressure they are made of layers of hardwood that are pressure treated and glued together
DIY,not_removed,mainly because its bizarrely thick i doubt it really breaks much faster than a normal board
DIY,not_removed,please do id love to cut a few from different materials this is a super fun idea i need this in my life honestly id love the files the way they are right now
DIY,not_removed,its disbonding between the nodes of honeycomb the honeycomb itself is comprised of thin aluminum sheets akin to tin foil that are glued together and cut to a desired thickness the glue between nodes fails under dynamic loads such as bouncing on the deck and separates this leads to the foil krinkling i used to do a ton of work with honeycomb panels
DIY,not_removed,ooo nice weird angle you may not have thought of some folks like myself who are severely hearing impaired and as a result have serious equilibrium and balance issues are super jelly because omg you can skate and you skating is a thing that can happen because for me in my world it does not go down kudos and props make more videos of you making more things because youre good at both huzzah and that
DIY,not_removed,are you running pwm off the smoothieboard into a laser psu curious if so and if youre doing a level conversion to or what ive been fiddling around with a few circuits
DIY,not_removed,yeah im absolutely interested in this as well estimated cost build process it looks amaaazing
DIY,not_removed,thanks for the reply i suspected it would catch on the edge of a shoe and cause issues
DIY,not_removed,braile skateboarding has a series on youtube called you make it we skate it or something this thing would be perfect for it
DIY,not_removed,cool keep me in mind
DIY,not_removed,polycarbonate you say httpswwwjellyskateboardscomcollectionscompletes
DIY,not_removed,he says it at the bottom though
DIY,not_removed,bring back futurella
DIY,not_removed,horsepower
DIY,not_removed,i dont get it
DIY,not_removed,thats rad i skate with a group of guys from the tristate area that i live in and it always a blast to skate with some of the fathers of the younger gents some of them used to shred back in the day and some of them just joined to skate with their kids either way its always a blast being around people learning new things in skateboarding keep it up
DIY,not_removed,im me and my friends always think its awesome seeing older guys at the park having fun hell ive seen a guy that was in his early just having a blast youre never too old man
DIY,not_removed,just lean in man
DIY,not_removed,its sick to see older dudes at the park skaters as a whole are a great community and its really good to see even guys like you getting into it keep it up man
DIY,not_removed,do it im too asked my friends to show me how its just nice to cruise around listening to music still trying to learn how to do an ollie
DIY,not_removed,and i havent done shit ive looked at boards seems like you could easily put something together for about bucks whatd you get im overweight not like morbidly obese but i could and should drop about lbs pretty easily but i play roller hockey a week and have since i was about that takes a toll on your knees i want a board and at least see what i could do i just worry for real though tell me about stuff you bought a premade kit or pick the parts and have them shipped or order everything from place and have them assembe it for you good on you for doing what i havent
DIY,not_removed,skateboards are meant to be skated not everything is a precious artifact especially skateboards created for the express purpose of being sent to a show called you make it we skate it httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvdbqhivyfsrg
DIY,not_removed,you dont like it that they skate on boards that people send them in other words the entire premise of the videos and the only reason theyre receiving the boards at all
DIY,not_removed,this was advertising for the company that made it it wasnt meant to be kept in a museum
DIY,not_removed,people send in their creations for the purpose of them testing it and most likely destroying it why would you send in a glass skateboard and not expect it to smash
DIY,not_removed,well they skated their youtube gold button so they kinda ruin everything
DIY,not_removed,is anyone gonna link this thing or what edit
DIY,not_removed,breaks drill bit
DIY,not_removed,you gonna tell that to the other guys too just downvote and move on
DIY,not_removed,un second this everything doesnt need to be carbon fiber
DIY,not_removed,i built it mostly from scratch eventually ill make plans
DIY,not_removed,no youre totally right the outer slats experience more loading this isnt a big deal where the trucks mount since the cross braces distribute the load to the trucks but the center brace has no trucks to push against and it starts wiggling off when the glue fails
DIY,not_removed,my plan is to use a chiselbelt sander to scrape the char off the glue joints
DIY,not_removed,clearly
DIY,not_removed,it is available for networkedsubscription based licenses which most companies have
DIY,not_removed,you need to pretend to be a student i have little to no compunction about lying when it comes to my graduation date i am a me and i need to keep up to date with a few cad packages to remain competitive not just the one or two i use at a particular job finding a student id can be tricky but i have managed to renew my licence a few times by saying that i need to to be prepared to use inventor in the work environment
DIY,not_removed,just a heads up ive never actually sent in any proof when applying for a solidworks license in theory you could just come up with a name and pick a school to get it for free
DIY,not_removed,i doubt it has enough pop to even successfully ollie on it
DIY,not_removed,buy it and try it im not a skater i was speaking from a design perspective not skater perspective
DIY,not_removed,plywood its the same thing as plywood its considered one piece they wont survive tons not the measurement of weight
DIY,not_removed,it has the ability to flex more without any damage being done
DIY,not_removed,yes originally i had the pwm directly connected to the laser supply which is ok since its an input high impedance and ttl high is anything over i ended up having some usb noise problems and swapped the direct connection with an optoisolator that circuit is essential a one way logic converter which also electronically isolates the smoothieboard from the laser psu edit wait i lied i dont think i ever connected the pin directly to the laser i used one of the small mosfets
DIY,not_removed,im running exactly that configuration with no problems into a ttl input generally works perfectly because vih the minimum voltage seen as a high level is so no level conversion required
DIY,not_removed,yes thats actually my inspiration for the project
DIY,not_removed,to shreds you say
DIY,not_removed,ive seen a few reasons people that locally share the park while they film say they get in the way and are in actuality pretty annoying though given they have brought ya know million people into the hobby they have to film stuff somewhere the rest is just hate on them for being gimmicky personality quirks being kid friendly etc pretty much nonsense trolling
DIY,not_removed,i cant say officially since ive never seen any real hate but if i had to guess its because aaron can kind of be a jerk sometimes
DIY,not_removed,the you make it we skate it series is the source of a lot of it they used to just make tip trick videos aimed at beginners but this series is regarded as a clickbait gimmick which involves them making that youtube cash off of destroying things their fans have spent time and money on creating on top of that theyre sponsored by revive skateboards even though many dont consider them skilled enough to be considered pro the same could be said for a lot of revives lineup the skate community just tends to shun anything that they believe isnt giving back to the community
DIY,not_removed,aaron can be an asshole
DIY,not_removed,and the lead guy is a scientologist
DIY,not_removed,i have a particularly bad knee as well from dropping a motorcycle it was kind of rough the first few times i really went out even without falling on it or anything since then it seems to hold up decently well im just being very careful not to hurt it its noteworthy that when i read your comment i spent the next two days watching braille skate videos while waiting on my board to arrive im a pretty big fan now and i credit them also with getting me into this i researched all the different parts and by far and away the most helpful site i found was httpswwwwarehouseskateboardscomhelpbuyingguides i wanted to purchase my gear from them because they taught me so much but i ended up going with tacticscom because it was a little cheaper free assembly and no minimum for free shipping the first board i chose was this chima icon from real i put trucks on it with wheels rated i went with standard hardware and standard jessup griptape they shipped me the board already assembled this board was perfect for what i needed i live in downtown seattle the roads here are bumpy and the hills are treacherous so the bigger wheels and wider board were really necessary for me to be able to cruise without getting thrown off my board every few minutes that said ive recognized that i get tired very quickly when practicing tricks and i overheat so i have to take a break until im not sweating so profusely i realized im overexerting myself trying to learn simple tricks and that a thinner board would not only be easier to learn on but also wouldnt wear me out so quickly lastly i wanted smaller wheels for better acceleration and an easier pop so i went back to tactics and bought the prebuilt complete of this deck i also picked up the cheapest skatetool on the site so i could loosen or tighten my trucks tactics ships the boards with very loose trucks these seem to be more difficult to learn on but will make you better in the long run i think i will tighten the trucks on the board to make it easier to learn the ollie
DIY,not_removed,i blame pixar for making me see a lamp as an animate object with a personality
DIY,not_removed,you make it we stick it up on the wall in our office doesnt have quite the same ring to it
DIY,not_removed,i know a lot of guys that hang their boards as art but like i said it wouldnt be a show if they didnt skate it
DIY,not_removed,mvp here
DIY,not_removed,wow they are dumb that seriously could have cut an artery and killed one of them
DIY,not_removed,hey but now hes using the drill bit to open boxes so its all good
DIY,not_removed,uses wood drill bit into metal
DIY,not_removed,oh irony how tasty
DIY,not_removed,nobody else made a this post except you chief just upvote and move on
DIY,not_removed,ill be honest this is the reason i came to the thread definitely wanted to see how one has their own laser cutter
DIY,not_removed,looks really good if you are looking for additional torsional stiffness you could use a layer of fiberglass and epoxy a single layer should be mostly transparent so it wont mess up the wood look
DIY,not_removed,try putting the middle cross brace on the top
DIY,not_removed,some finishing nails or brads through the outer slats into the cross pieces would help reduce wriggle and would be almost invisible
DIY,not_removed,sounds time consuming i assume this is a oneoff
DIY,not_removed,i will have to check into that with our license administrator thanks
DIY,not_removed,back when i worked at a university up until even educational licenses of solidworks cost money cheap though only but not free
DIY,not_removed,if youre going to commit fraud to get a license just pirate the software
DIY,not_removed,well i hope he sends it to braile so well find out
DIY,not_removed,its a completely different process from regular plywood
DIY,not_removed,except all of its flex is based around glue joints with very small contact points op even shows that the joints came apart just from normal riding normal skateboards can take way more than that
DIY,not_removed,yeah its ok unless youre trying to it as an analog equiv since pwm isnt the same as pwm so doesnt matter about the high im using with a logic converter and an rc circuit to help convert it to an effective analog singlal cheers
DIY,not_removed,its better than that actually is the minimum voltage generated by a ttl high output but the input threshold is necessarily lower than this its
DIY,not_removed,youre not running pwm so not exactly this setup then for full scale of analog in on a laser psu youre presumably doing just laser onoff versus controlling the power level via the smoothie or just not needing the whole power range from the laser psu
DIY,not_removed,wow nice id love to see this on there are going to make one for them maybe using epoxy instead of wood glue
DIY,not_removed,thats just the nature of filming anything you get in the way slow things down annoy people who dont get it it could be worse they could actually get proper city permits not go guerrilla like they probably do and then the whole park would be shut down and taped off like some crime scene until theyre done filming
DIY,not_removed,john hill is great
DIY,not_removed,making that youtube cash off of destroying things their fans have spent time and money on creating yeah but thats what they were created for people wouldnt send this stuff in if they didnt watch the videos and if theyve seen the videos theyll understand that its getting broken
DIY,not_removed,er the fans know full well that the thing will be skated and as a result probably destroyed theyre always careful to try to make it last but most of the things the fans send in just arent ready to hold up to skating nobody is sending in a beautiful sculpture for you make it we skate it videos and thinking gee i sure hope they dont skate this it would destroy it
DIY,not_removed,youre really whetting my appetite for purchasing
DIY,not_removed,you brang it we hang it
DIY,not_removed,that is not even close to the most dangerous thing ive seen tried on a skate board its not exactly a safety first endeavor
DIY,not_removed,you better not watch the saw blade one then
DIY,not_removed,first tryyyy
DIY,not_removed,you might be anemic see a doctor
DIY,not_removed,this down vote train is looking delicious and i want to hop on board edit this is more then i couldve dreamed of thanks everyone
DIY,not_removed,i think for a time there was a one table top laser cutters arent prohibitively expensive
DIY,not_removed,middleside topwise
DIY,not_removed,could even have lineup holes cut by the laser when its doing the slatts for a metal rod to go straight through then flatten or bend the outside edges or the metal
DIY,not_removed,yeah
DIY,not_removed,i was only talking about the structure not the glue if it was made properly or i guess the wording would be better it wouldnt have that issue
DIY,not_removed,i have the pwm hooked up to the high input ttl logic control so the voltage doesnt matter theres a separate analog input which controls the current im driving it with a pot voltage divider
DIY,not_removed,ah i see your point i actually am running pwm i forgot that the psu input is likely a true analog input and not ttl have you checked exactly what current your laser psu is outputting since you should be calibrating your psu to output the right current chinese suppliers routinely set this too high that would also automatically account for your pwm signal voltage seems easier than adding hardware for a level conversion or dedicating your small mosfet outputs to
DIY,not_removed,no doubt its just haters for real
DIY,not_removed,i get what youre saying but the key part to your argument was annoy people who dont get it it sounds like the people that are annoyed are the ones who get it
DIY,not_removed,watching that guy exhausts me i wish i had half his energy motivation and love for life though
DIY,not_removed,oh and i meant to say that the first board was around but that second one was only i got my best ollies ever today now i just gotta get a helmet so i can commit to learning to ollie while moving for the most part my immediate goals have been to learn to cruise the city ive gotten pretty good at it but the real deal is when i can ollie up a curb instead of going aroundgetting off the board
DIY,not_removed,you can get a chinese laser off alibaba cheap
DIY,not_removed,yeah i have mine doing pwm to the analog control directly to control the current vs switch onoff with the separate current control like you so i can control it from gcode
DIY,not_removed,indeed its not difficult to add a level conversion plus rc as i said earlier i had what im looking for is other people with the same setup as mine to compare rcs i have a pretty good setup going but id like to see if i can make it better the problem is not the calibration of the right current or the voltage range its converting from pwm to analog yes ive checked my power settings
DIY,not_removed,dont get making videos they meant not dont get skateboarding
DIY,not_removed,see youre young in a big cool city im old and live in the county of st louis the board is pretty good
DIY,not_removed,are you sure there isnt already an rc filter inside the psu passing pwm directly to it isnt unexpected
DIY,not_removed,but skateboarders love to make videos judging by the way the person originally brought it up it sounds like its the video producers who are the ones who dont get it
DIY,not_removed,yea seattle is pretty cool honestly i hate it the rent is fucking ridiculous the second board is pretty good im glad i got both so i have the flexibility and can practice on two boards that behave fairly differently i imagine stlouis is about as skateboard friendly as seattle though possibly not nothing like an empty downhill bicycle lane maybe less skate parks though
DIY,not_removed,yes positive its not unexpected but i get better results with the rc than straight up pwm as do others
DIY,not_removed,but skateboarders love to make videos some do some dont get it reread the comment it was talking about producing videos in general
DIY,not_removed,yeah but making skateboarding videos as a hobby and producing something of consistent quality and probably more than a one person crew are very different processes i mean they dont get whats involved in producing a web series
DIY,not_removed,seattle has a nice downtown st louis doesnt actually if you look at crime statistics for st louis were always pretty bad but its got a lot to do with how this dumb town is broken up into counties everyone goes down to the blues and cardinals games maybe stops at a bar or the new ballpark village and then gets the hell out of the city and back to county homes so living in the county everything is really spread out if i want to exercise and not drive somewhere close ill mountain bike i really want to try skating im just worried about it sitting in my garage mocking me
DIY,not_removed,i feel you man and honestly it really isnt the easiest thing to get into i have skating experience from when i longboarded so i can balance and take hills prettty well people seem to always watch you when youre in sight and with that theres an inherent judgment when you look like you dont know how to handle that board even in a nice reasonably skateable city like seattle even as someone very enthusiastic about learning its a lot to convince yourself to go out and practice a opportunity cost couldshould be doing something else but b its downright hard its physically demanding and theres no guarantee on any given day that you wont look like a dumbass andor get hurt falling
DIY,not_removed,nasty cussing hatchimal
DIY,not_removed,that looks like hardwood floor from the side is this correct if so was it a factory finished hardwood or field finished to begin with either way you have a couple issues you could be dealing with first if its factory finished that is extremely tough finish that is deep into the wood you have to do a hell of a lot of sanding to get it out of the wood before stain will take properly second if its field finished most finishers do not wipe up excess stain they use a penetrating stain that they lay on and let completely soak into the wood as it dries so again you have finish deep into the grain that takes a lot of sanding to remove this is why they use drum sanders on floors oak should not need a conditioner as it takes stain fairly evenly conditioner is for wood like pine that has hard and soft spots that take stain unevenly if you arent getting even coverage on oak then the surface is not open enough for stain
DIY,not_removed,its solid not a veneer
DIY,not_removed,add some moisture to the wood first just rub a damp cloth on it then apply the stain the moisture will help the grain stand up and also help wick the stain in
DIY,not_removed,what grit are you sanding it if its too fine the stain wont penetrate the wood try sanding it down again with and try again if you went too fine
DIY,not_removed,all of this sounds very correct looked up oak stair noses and it seems thats what im working with im not certain whenwhere it was finished originally but im thinking it may have been factory finished thanks for the response as it was driving me nuts
DIY,not_removed,i think it is solid edit though im fairly new to all of this here is a picture of the back side of it not sure if you can tell from this or not
DIY,not_removed,hey there just a few ideas for you to try change the lightbulb sounds simple but surprising how often its the case set your multimeter to volts ac put one lead on the metal box ground and the other on each of the wires on the switch if switch is working both should have same voltage reading to ground here in canada turn off circuit breaker disconnect the wires from the switch connect them and turn the breaker on if switch was the only issue the light will come on if these dont work post a few photos and we will keep workin it
DIY,not_removed,turn off breaker connect wires at switch see if light turns on means bad switch were you getting volts before or after switch
DIY,not_removed,anything else on that circuit maybe a bathroom that is protected by a gfi
DIY,not_removed,take the switch off and tie the two wires from it together that will eliminate the switch as the issue as others have said you need to do a proper ac voltage test with your meter depending on your electrician they may have ran your switch wire in many different ways chances are though you have either blackwhite or redblack take one end of your meter and put it on each wire and then to the electrical box you should have if you do chances are a neutral wire has let go or theres been a break further down in your circuit id take down the light and make sure all connections are super tight before continuing and that the splices in the box are all still good
DIY,not_removed,i had a similar problem changed the light switch to a new one and it worked fine however given that you say you tested the switch at a different location it sounds like it could be the wiring did you check that with the voltometer yet i agree with the guy above when it comes to something that could kill you or burn your house down leave it to the pros
DIY,not_removed,with breaker off remove light and connect black to white than go over to the switch and check continuity across the circuit if there is a break in the circuit further down it would explain why you still see potential voltage after the switch with it on make absolutely sure that you return it back to normal before you put the breaker back on or youll have a short circuit
DIY,not_removed,putting multimeter on both side of the switch will always give near you need to put one probe on the live wire and the second probe on either the ground wire directly on the casing will do the same or on the neutral wire in your situation neutral wires are probably connected together with a wire nut if you only have two wires in your switch box the two connected on the switch the neutral will be in your light box hope this helps a little
DIY,not_removed,sounds like your neutral became undone either its loose in your joints or cut elsewhere
DIY,not_removed,first of all the switch should be grounded as should that metal box second the volts you are reading is irrelevant i would check the pig tail and see that those wires are still bound after that i would connect the two black wires and see if the lights come on if they do go buy a new switch if they dont you should call a qualified electrician and quit fucking with shit that can burn your house down or hurt you
DIY,not_removed,i turned the breaker off and connected the wire still no light when i use the voltage detector up on the fixture it sounds off i got volts by putting the probes on either side of the switch i dont have a ground wire on this switch if that makes a difference
DIY,not_removed,you did a beautiful job the edge result blends perfectly with the house and looks so finished and neat
DIY,not_removed,ah the screenedin porch put a fan in if its even remotely feasible had one growing up told my wife it was basically the best thing since sliced bread she doubted me then we bought a house with a screenedin porch within two weeks of the arrival of summer she said it was the greatest thing ever outside air flow no insects you can use that thing when its absolutely boiling hot and it still feels great were out there almost every night from march to december
DIY,not_removed,i would put a gutter there for sure water is coming from off that roof onto the patio roof area and that may be why you had the rotten wood before actually
DIY,not_removed,make sure to watch the top of the partial wall you framed for water pooling and any gaps that develop as everything expandscontracts over time especially on the sides where there is no overhang limiting the amount of rain exposure it probably would have been best to add a sill on top sloping away from the porch to ensure water doesnt penetrate the plywood or wall cavities that being said with enough caulk and proper exterior paint it should be okay just make sure to periodically inspect for gaps
DIY,not_removed,what are the dimensions of your porch we have a narrow space that could fit a feet screened patio but are debating if feet might be just too narrow
DIY,not_removed,thanks for the advice is black roof caulking enough to hold it in place or should i lift up the shingles enough to nail the drip edge in edit the article says roofing cement
DIY,not_removed,thank you this is my first project of this sort and it definitely took some time to complete but im very happy with the result
DIY,not_removed,ok cool there was a gutter up before but no flashing i added flashing and was debating whether or not to add a new gutter i will definitely add a gutter before it rains thanks
DIY,not_removed,thanks for the advice i will definitely keep an eye on it
DIY,not_removed,mine is about so i think you will be good in looking at my porch feet may be a little narrow for having chairs on both sides but definitely big enough for a porch and chairstable on one side
DIY,not_removed,thanks for the link
DIY,not_removed,electrical engineer who until recently developed ev power trains please just install a bigger gasoline engine what youre wanting to do will pose a massive fiscal cost and equally massive safety risk youre wanting to largely reengineer your vehicles power and drive trains have you considered the cost of the battery alone that one piece done correctly will cost you several times more than your cars current value people think its as simple as buying a bunch of recycled laptop cells and soldering cringe them together you will burn your house down vehicle traction batteries require complex cooling systems that make for gratifying projects on their own without the other of what youre wanting to do hopefully this is seen as a levelheaded warning rather than a negative comment ev systems arent turnkey kits at all yet and the motor size is just a fraction and relatively simple piece of the equation edit a word
DIY,not_removed,so before you go about your science project here i would find some good examples of folks that have done it and see how they would do it differently next time an ac motor in the driveshaft with separate controls from the engine with the ability for regeneration braking would lower the size of the battery pack needed the idea is that you are helping the gas motor out of its inefficiency zones not making the car fully electric thing is you can probably buy a hybrid crv or civic for as much as homebrewing your own costs there is an hybrid for sale locally for the motor for my electric vw project was an engine swap or a new car will get you what you want adding a motor custom driveshaft work controller and battery pack is possible but i have yet to see examples of it done right
DIY,not_removed,please listen carefully to s cautionary remarks i agree with all of them however i wont add to them ill just say that if you do decide to do this i wouldnt look to the alternator for battery charging its already there yes but its a device and so when you want to pull significant power out of it youll be drawing large currents and require short thick wires to avoid large resistive losses the alternator itsself isnt actually a very efficient generator either httpwwwdelcoremycomdocumentshighefficiencywhitepaperaspx by a manufacturer mentions best case efficiencies of for a good alternator and as low as for a crappyimproperly loaded alternator as silly as it sounds if you had a reasonably good threephase brushless traction system connected to your rear diff it would likely be more efficient for you to run the motor put power into the asphalt with the front wheels and take it back out of the asphalt with the rear wheels using regenerative braking on the electric drivetrain than it would be to take from the alternator and boost it to battery voltage for charging
DIY,not_removed,hi folks weve noticed that some links to imgur on mobile are redirecting to a page asking you to install an app instead of letting you see the project this behavior doesnt appear to be affecting the desktop experience given that this is an imgur issue theres very little we can do about it from the reddit side up to this point imgur has been a fantastic image host for rdiy but were unhappy at this change in behavior on mobile does anyone have any suggestions for what we can do about it
DIY,not_removed,wtf is this install the imgur app bullshit i literally cant view the photos from alien blue or safari
DIY,not_removed,this is beautiful nice work i have an old sewing machine base sitting around that i need to do something with thanks for the motivation
DIY,not_removed,nice you might consider filling that crack in the wood so that it either doesnt expand any more or perhaps more importantly so that it doesnt get filled with all sorts of nasty crud
DIY,not_removed,from the photos it looks like your legs do not allow for natural expansion and contraction of the slab it should be okay since its in a stable aircontrolled environment but any fluctuations in temp and humility could cause the slab to crack and warp due to not being able to freely move and like mentioned already fill the existing cracks with resin and next time look into installing butterflies or bowties into the cracks to stop them from spreading more great job otherwise ive always wanted to steal my moms old sowing machine and do the same
DIY,not_removed,damn nice work man
DIY,not_removed,perfect pong table
DIY,not_removed,woah i didnt know i could buy slabs off ebay
DIY,not_removed,now this is a great piece of work
DIY,not_removed,thats so pretty
DIY,not_removed,ohhh yeah baby thats what i said out loud when i saw your table id like the wood a bit more dark but thats just preferences nice work
DIY,not_removed,hang on are you like a golf club smith or something id like to hear about your workshop
DIY,not_removed,nice work love live edge slab tables
DIY,not_removed,awesome i love it
DIY,not_removed,cool i have a table like that from a tiny singer base so its more end table sized
DIY,not_removed,that looks awesome where did you get that wood slab from
DIY,not_removed,very nice
DIY,not_removed,what happened to the picturemobile
DIY,not_removed,this is beautiful
DIY,not_removed,what a great idea this looks so good now ill be combing flea markets for an old sewing machine very nice
DIY,not_removed,nice work i love making something new and nice out of something old
DIY,not_removed,gorgeous
DIY,not_removed,beautiful
DIY,not_removed,i need this 😻
DIY,not_removed,nice work i made one too a few years ago perfect laptop desk and the pedal is a good fidget thing too httpsimgurcomanmwdm
DIY,not_removed,lovely job mate
DIY,not_removed,nice coating the wood while its attached to the hardware is ballsy though id probably do it separately because im sure id make a mess somewhere
DIY,not_removed,looks pretty great
DIY,not_removed,my dad did literally the exact same thing a year ago i had to double check to make sure it wasnt the same table so i knew he wasnt on reddit
DIY,not_removed,if anyone in the phoenix az area is looking for raw wood slabs similar ops gorgeous work i have a great source
DIY,not_removed,whoa nice table
DIY,not_removed,great work looks fabulous
DIY,not_removed,looks pretty great
DIY,not_removed,how much was the slab if you dont mind my asking also what type of wood is it
DIY,not_removed,looks good great job
DIY,not_removed,i dont like most peoples diys but this is clever
DIY,not_removed,love this great job post pics after filling the crack
DIY,not_removed,😍
DIY,not_removed,ive made two of these for my boss one still has the spin wheels under it
DIY,not_removed,i fine peice of lumber if i do say so myself
DIY,not_removed,gorgeous what an awesome idea
DIY,not_removed,im starting to wonder if this is rtables in disguise
DIY,not_removed,nice job theyd sell that shit for like dollars on anthropologie looks great
DIY,not_removed,this is beautiful
DIY,not_removed,i really love the wood you used for the table top i have been putting together plans for a diy computer desk does anyone know of a good place to get good solid wood such as this table i would like it to be about feet long and the only thing i can seem to find in hardware stores around here that would work is particle board and i really dont want to go that route
DIY,not_removed,nice
DIY,not_removed,i have all these supplies but zero skill does anyone wanna make this for me will provide beer and snacks
DIY,not_removed,where do you get wood slab like this do you somehow mill yourself or buy somewhere
DIY,not_removed,looks awesome op ive been thinking of making a similar table with the slab did it come preleveled how heavy was it really curious about getting it on ebay of all places too was shipping insane
DIY,not_removed,great job also grab some high heat black spray paint and update that fireplace brass with a modern look
DIY,not_removed,youve made a hipsters wet dream come true jokes aside this looks great nice work
DIY,not_removed,thats really creative
DIY,not_removed,my parents have something similar as well probably or decades ago my dad took an old narrow singer base and secured an old wood butcher block to the top it has been used as an end table table for plants and a tv stand over the years
DIY,not_removed,every time i see this i think its a carrot on a couch
DIY,not_removed,all i can think about is how much it would suck if you stubbed your toe on that it looks awesome though
DIY,not_removed,wow that is gorgeous well done
DIY,not_removed,op did you have the base already or where did you buy it
DIY,not_removed,its gorgeous very well done
DIY,not_removed,great idea 👍👍👍👍👌
DIY,not_removed,how much is a slab of wood like that and how heavy is something like that
DIY,not_removed,guess alot of people do this
DIY,not_removed,nice work but more importantly i have the same ikea throw pillow you have excellent taste in pillows just sayin
DIY,not_removed,the table looks nice too bad your wife is going to clutter the shit out of it
DIY,not_removed,right in the nuts
DIY,not_removed,was the giant shlong and ballsack in the middle of the woodtoo part of the design d
DIY,not_removed,man i generally hate sewing machine base tables its like the worlds most played out home decorating thing that said that looks great and its even more awesome because you made it
DIY,not_removed,dude return the slab
DIY,not_removed,my dad did something similar he made a coffee table from an old barn door and bought some legs
DIY,not_removed,i work at wwwhangoutlightingcom and i didnt even realize what i had been sitting at everyday at lunch haha love the table
DIY,not_removed,nice slab too bad its cracked
DIY,not_removed,someone needs to get a life lol
DIY,not_removed,where does a person find a slab a wood like this
DIY,not_removed,this looks really great but im a little worried about how heavy that slab might be in combination with it being much higher than the base is wide id hate to see a toddler pull up on that and it tip over on them
DIY,not_removed,literally a piece of wood on top of a base
DIY,not_removed,i nice it
DIY,not_removed,obviously you didand it looks exactly like it should shit imo
DIY,not_removed,good boy
DIY,not_removed,return the slab
DIY,not_removed,ugly as fuck
DIY,not_removed,well arent you just special
DIY,not_removed,umoreexercise seems to have figured out i think unless it autochanges by imgur somehow upon submission and it works fine with the link heshe suggested
DIY,not_removed,tell imgur its being a little bit of a bitch and to stop it
DIY,not_removed,we should start a new image hosting service and call it imager
DIY,not_removed,doesnt reddit now have a native image hosting option perhaps we can publicly start steering subscribers away from imgur i dont blame them for wanting to make a profit but theyve been on a very fast downhill trajectory for the past several months now
DIY,not_removed,it appears the links start with iobimgur if that helps first ive ever seen that kind of imgur link edit iob not iop
DIY,not_removed,call forth upitchforkemporium
DIY,not_removed,up to this point imgur has been a fantastic image host you have to be joking
DIY,not_removed,is there a way to trick websites into thinking that your mobile device uses a desktop browser
DIY,not_removed,its like imgur is actively trying to turn people off from using their service by strongarming them into app usage
DIY,not_removed,
DIY,not_removed,holy fucking shit i couldnt even find a way around it im going to delete their fucking app because of this crap im on alien blue i dont want to have to open another fucking app every time i want to look at a picture
DIY,not_removed,well if this becomes common practice rather than downloading the app ill just stop opening the links
DIY,not_removed,why are you still using alien blue
DIY,not_removed,its easy to do my mother made one much smaller that kept the mechanics at the bottom
DIY,not_removed,great idea will be picking up some epoxy to do that this weekend
DIY,not_removed,a quick google search turned up this video on using a twopart epoxy and a complementary dye to fill in a crack that might be a better way to go than the more gaudy glow in the dark approach
DIY,not_removed,yessssssss glow in the dark resin or crushed turquoise
DIY,not_removed,the tiniest bit if you really force it i considered adding some gussets but it seems strong enough without the extra work of adding them
DIY,not_removed,i have a desk made out of an old sewing table and it does wobble but its not as well reinforced as this table
DIY,not_removed,i hope he asked you to fix it if not you are the worst man slapping him and his work in the face by saying you made it better for him id be pissed and then you referred to that as a gift ouch
DIY,not_removed,i was going to mention wood movement as well op i assume you dont mind some more splitting of the wood even in new locations but if you do want some advice on how to secure the top differently let me know
DIY,not_removed,something like that i got tired of the shitty club work other places do and the costs associated with said shitty work so i decided to learn to do everything myself the iron head flying down the fairway a couple years back was the last straw now i spend way too much time tinkering with different shafts lengths swingweights heads wedge grinds etc and i do all the club work for friends
DIY,not_removed,ebay of all places
DIY,not_removed,i got it off ebay for less than shipped
DIY,not_removed,read the album captions
DIY,not_removed,is there a mill anywhere around
DIY,not_removed,it had been kiln dried and planed i think it weights about its not super heavy shipping can be crazy from some sellers but others are really reasonable i am fairly certain i paid around for the wood and shipping was it was a rare auction most being bin peruse the listings youll find some relatively cheap slabs obviously wood type and size will dictate price
DIY,not_removed,ha done already see the can of paint on the hearth yep used that the next day
DIY,not_removed,already has lasted all of hours
DIY,not_removed,username checks out
DIY,not_removed,he said ebay
DIY,not_removed,lol you seem like a nice person
DIY,not_removed,welcome to reddit git gud or git out
DIY,not_removed,following the link on desktop redirects to the regular gallery link which does seem to work on mobile so it looks like its theoretically possible to write a bot that would post a mobilefriendly link in the comments each time still not a great experience for mobile users but a possible workaround
DIY,not_removed,reddit only allows single image submissions until they improve their image hosting support rdiy does not allow them as a host
DIY,not_removed,this i opened a rpolandball post and it had iimgurcom instead of iobimgurcom and it worked just fine i think ops have to take note from now to share the mobile friendly link from now on
DIY,not_removed,ive had this as well lately when submitting links they work on desktop
DIY,not_removed,is imgur not universally accepted as a great image host who disagrees with that on what grounds
DIY,not_removed,seriously i get it they get no ad revenue through reddit posts but this is not fixing the problem
DIY,not_removed,worst thing is i have the app and i still get that shit
DIY,not_removed,i even have the app and its not redirecting
DIY,not_removed,and disallowing hosted images from being used on forumsforum rpgs which is incredibly annoying for us forum role players
DIY,not_removed,mvp
DIY,not_removed,im impressed my mother made a table similar to this and gave it to my sister but she kept the original lower frame on it including the four pedal and wheel and made the table only a metre wide this is still extremely nice though
DIY,not_removed,on pc i can see the link start with iobimgurcom so getting the regular gallery is no problem luckily the comments always deliver
DIY,not_removed,because the official reddit app isnt as easy to use as alien blue every couple weeks i go back and try the official app but its just not there yet
DIY,not_removed,am i the only one using baconreader
DIY,not_removed,id love to have a desk with a treadle maybe it could be hooked up to actually generate electricity but even if it didnt i think i would enjoy the motion while i work
DIY,not_removed,after looking up examples of this it looks pretty great i believe that this is the route i will take thanks for the info
DIY,not_removed,eg
DIY,not_removed,i call them butterfly splines but yeah thats the way to go here not only does it look great and hold the piece together it impresses the hell out of all your friends that understand woodwork
DIY,not_removed,you can buy epoxy specifically for this at woodworking shops it has a low expansion rate so it wont extend the crack when it warms while curing another option is to completely flood finish the top of the wood with a very low weight epoxy like a fiberglass resin for example
DIY,not_removed,if youve already sealed the wood you might need to expose the surface inside the crack again for the epoxy to grip im not sure about that though so its worth looking into first
DIY,not_removed,oversensitive much
DIY,not_removed,very nice i like seeing workspaces httpsislimgzvgrkzjpg is one side of my current setup
DIY,not_removed,thanks for the tip also nice work
DIY,not_removed,what did you search for to find this if you dont mind me asking in my area its really difficult to find anything other than traditional pieces of cedar pine birch etc so being able to order something online without spending an arm and a leg would be awesome
DIY,not_removed,thanks the wood is from some local lumber mill the main wood is pine and the accents are red oak basic minwax stain and around coats of thinned poly it was a learn how to use your tools properly project when i first started woodworking
DIY,not_removed,k now what
DIY,not_removed,im not sure how i didnt think of that before but i will look into it and see thanks for the suggestion
DIY,not_removed,
DIY,not_removed,for a temporary fix it sounds reasonable and it would be widely appreciated by the mobile half of the community
DIY,not_removed,if i remove the iob from the front of the url on my mobile browser it works just fine
DIY,not_removed,imgur was a great image host and thats the reason theyre still widely accepted as such but sadly theyre going downhill fast between the slow load times the questionable ui and the constant blatant pushing of their mobile app and now this theyre corporatizing and turning to shit fast enough to make comcast proud
DIY,not_removed,it is slow and full of ads popups and has a ton of bad ui choices you should have seen them when they first came out simplefunctionalno adsnow they have turned into this bs social network image host etc etc
DIY,not_removed,mostly freedom of speech
DIY,not_removed,guess the creator forgot why he made the website to begin with
DIY,not_removed,and the app sucks
DIY,not_removed,real
DIY,not_removed,um yeah hes saying hes getting rid of the imgur app
DIY,not_removed,whats hard about the official app
DIY,not_removed,possibly
DIY,not_removed,i assume you just sand it flush with the wood does a poly fill the sanding marks similarly to the wood
DIY,not_removed,just checking man it kind of sounded like you were that guy who could have done it better and wanted to let him know this clears it up
DIY,not_removed,i wouldnt want anyone touching any of my woodworking projects without asking me maybe i liked the fucking wobble before you fixed it steve
DIY,not_removed,these are images of my httpimgurcomatdzse from a while ago but it gives the general idea of the space
DIY,not_removed,wood slab it took a few weeks of looking before i found a slab that was the dimensions i wanted and a price that i could afford this is a piece of hickory iirc i also have a sweet thick slab of red cedar that will be made into a coffee table got that one for around shipped obviously prices vary based on size and type of wood
DIY,not_removed,this is rdiy any volunteers
DIY,not_removed,yup and they also have overlay install the app buttons over images imgur has turned into shit
DIY,not_removed,whats your alternative
DIY,not_removed,i have no idea how freedom of speech ties into a freetouse voluntary image hosting site
DIY,not_removed,was it made just for reddit i wasnt sure i didnt want to bring it up the url is weird and this was the only time it happened to me tonight idk what the deal is
DIY,not_removed,is the creator even involved anymore
DIY,not_removed,the
DIY,not_removed,cant swipe on stuff you have to click the special spot to hide a link or collapse a comment string its just not as efficient i can consume content in alien blue much faster
DIY,not_removed,fair enough i didnt know what you were talking about i dont know anything about woodworking yet so i wanted to link to a video for the benefit of others if you have a better video please feel free to link it
DIY,not_removed,custom work is more awesome
DIY,not_removed,if you do it right theres no sanding with poly you do progressive thin coats until youre wiping on a mirror finish youll fill sanding marks but it will look like you used poly to fill sanding marks go cross grain with some stapled to a for a bit to knock down sanding marks first with flooding epoxy you make a dam around the perimeter and let it set in a dustfree environment it will look like a million dollars if you just want to fill the crack use a razor to trim it and try to do it in one stroke
DIY,not_removed,hey epoxy is super messy so youre going to want to prep your space with a tarp or plastic then youre going to want to prevent leaks so prep your slab with by taping the cracks on the bottom of the slab i use a high quality painters tape for small cracks and duct tape for large ones use some putty or clay for to stop the epoxy from leaking out the ends once youre ready to mixpour bear in mind that its best to slowly build layers and use a low flame on a torch or hey even a lighter works to rapidly expand the epoxy to get rid of bubbles this process is a bit slow but stay on it a void that size can take upwards of an hour to fill use a slow setting epoxy hr version works great and overfill the void a little bit so that once you overfill if there are any bubbles that you miss they will rise to the overfill section and you wont have any voids on what will eventually be the surface of your table once its set use a cabinetcard scraper to get rid of most of the excess then sand to fine grit then follow up with a couple of coats of finish also with a crack that size another option would be to cut and inlay some butterflies aka dutchemens bowtie keys etc it looks harder than it actually is and theres loads of videos on youtube on how to do it
DIY,not_removed,very nice love the counter spaceand lots of power supply did you inherit the work space cause unless you are old some of that stuff predates you go vikings i guess rscienceofdeduction would enjoy these
DIY,not_removed,awesome thanks for the reply
DIY,not_removed,you dont have to have an alternative in order to be dissatisfied with an existing option
DIY,not_removed,does not at least directly but it does not help when a company starts banning posts so only one narrative can be heard on the other hand fora are publicly available and they do contribute to the formation of public opinion
DIY,not_removed,yes he made it as a gift to reddit that was the only reason because he was fed up with imageshack and photobucket
DIY,not_removed,im pretty sure it was initially made to be a simple fast site for hosting images shared on reddit and then it took on a life of its own
DIY,not_removed,whats your favorite image host that probably wont go down anytime soon
DIY,not_removed,weird i dont have those problems
DIY,not_removed,ohshit sherlock references
DIY,not_removed,fed up with their money grubbing spamming behavior you mean yeah imgur is a huge disappointment i remember when people were encouraged to post direct links to images then it was frowned upon in subs for denying the website their revenue even though that was part of the original design now every time i click on a direct imgur link it redirects to the full page anyway and spams me fuck imgur
DIY,not_removed,why cant we make our own again lots of us are programmers except for the hug of death idk how to avoid that one edit this comment isnt so serious
DIY,not_removed,exactly this and then imgur introduced their own comments section and it became its own community im totally ignoring how the business side grew though i dont know much about that
DIY,not_removed,i wouldnt say theyre problems it just doesnt have those features so i dont use it but i check out the app usually when i see it has an update to see if it has anything new that makes it more usable so far nothing that makes it better than alien blue
DIY,not_removed,beware that when fighting monsters you yourself do not become a monster
DIY,not_removed,thats how this goes it turns out that as a site becomes more and more popular particularly a content storage and delivery site the site requires more and more hardware and software infrastructure which as it turns out is not free im not sure what you expect what is your job im sure it isnt providing a free service for millions of users for free justsayin
DIY,not_removed,and maintain it indefinitely for free as it becomes more and more popular and requires continual hardware and software infrastructure updates upgrades and maintenance im not sure thats a longterm possibility as evidenced by imgur for example
DIY,not_removed,theres already all the pomf clones catboxmoe pomfcat cocaineninja pomfis mixtapemoe reichio sugoividyagames etc theres uteknikio pixtoilelibreorg vgyme you could even use github
DIY,not_removed,i think reddit offering a image hosting solution was in response to imgur becoming shitty
DIY,not_removed,most of that happened before reddit introduced their hosting option at all
DIY,not_removed,that and supporting the continuous infrastructure upgrades and maintenance required to meet the growing demand for their service or maybe they are just terrible greedy scumbags i dunno im quick to harsh and poorly reasoned judgments myself so fuck those jerks amiright
DIY,not_removed,the amazon service
DIY,not_removed,theyd be a lot better off if they didnt let it grow its own shitty little community and hold a goddamn adult summer camp every year
DIY,not_removed,i mean if you people would start buying more gold
DIY,not_removed,this was my impression as well
DIY,not_removed,youre not wrong new business model go
DIY,not_removed,lol i cant really support reddit beyond helping to increase their ad revenue through lurking and clicks the ceo is potentially a cannibal and definitely a censor i already feel a bit guilty for being here at all im hoping that my third party ap gets more for my clicks than reddit its self

DIY,not_removed,so when it rains all the water from your roof spews into your coop genius
DIY,not_removed,i took the pictures before i added a gutter to the patio roof just before it rained and the entire floor of the coop was dry
DIY,not_removed,have you tried steel wool maybe with some that usually takes corrosion off of the metal stuff ive worked on in the past pretty much anything you do is going to take some elbow grease id think
DIY,not_removed,is this paint or some kind of oxidation looks like paint if so just use a stripper like you use to strip furniture also to clean the metal i recommend xylene its nasty stuff but is superior to all other paint thinners use protection for both and for the love of god do not let the two mix wipe down thoroughly with a rinse rag before using the other good luck
DIY,not_removed,ok thanks ill give a go ive tried a drill bit with a steel brush on the end if i have no joy from the ill go grab some wire wool i thought wire wool would have the same effect as a wire brush
DIY,not_removed,it was painted i used stripper to get it down this far but still no joy im currently attacking it with a wire brush and wet and dry
DIY,not_removed,about all you can do if you have already stripped the paint then this black would be the primer coat it is designee to adhereimpregnate itself into the metal very securely and it might even be non sandable primer hard
DIY,not_removed,the wire isnt important what broke is the connector you have to cut it off and put on a new one youll need the right size width of the spade it attaches to and the right type for a heating element theyre heavier and dont have a plastic sleeve youll also need a crimping tool you just strip the wire and crimp on the new connector
DIY,not_removed,dang you did find a wire

DIY,not_removed,yes this try to measure the connector on the other wire to find a match
DIY,not_removed,needlenose pliers and a steady hand can stand in for a crimping tool too
DIY,not_removed,install on the wall condensation moisture and water will seep into the mdf which does not hold up against water
DIY,not_removed,what are the shelves for perhaps mdf shelves are not the greatest thing for the garage i have a bunch of these and they are kickass go together in three minutes and impervious to water
DIY,not_removed,i have in my storage room just standing on concrete they are extremely strong and quick and easy to put together or take apart if needed
DIY,not_removed,those look great expensive but solid and potential water damage wont be an issue

DIY,not_removed,a thick slab of maple will be plenty strong to support your or so of tv and accessories i typically use thick hardwood lumber to build bookcases and desks i have a shelf on one bookcase that has been supporting about of books for several years without any noticeable deflection
DIY,not_removed,dont ask strangers if you have the slabs just test it set the slab up with some temporary supports where the legs will be books would work fine then put weight on it see if it flexes simple
DIY,not_removed,i would go with the inch itll look better imo
DIY,not_removed,httpwwwwoodbincomcalcssagulator
DIY,not_removed,by the time you get the slab flat then sanded it will likely be closer to if you can swing the id go with that
DIY,not_removed,this was the information i was looking for thank you
DIY,not_removed,i dont yet im picking them up this weekend i guess my question is whether i should pick up a or inch slab for tv stand but thanks
DIY,not_removed,i agree but im afraid they might put me over my budget but ill see what the difference is when i go to purchase the slabs
DIY,not_removed,sag is acceptable thanks this site is awesome

DIY,not_removed,im an electrician sounds like you bought a halo retrofit kit all the materials used in the can are designed for incandescent light bulbs so they can withstand a good amount of heat the sockets are fine to rest on the led when it slides up into the can
DIY,not_removed,all it is is a difference between a bracketed housing and non bracketed housing for the light socket some cans come with them and some do not if it concerns you take a twist tie or zip tie and connect the socket to hang off one of the holes inside the can near the top
DIY,not_removed,i dont think that the socket is the reason its getting warm i think itd just get warm anyway how warm is it it seems like those two parts are what you need in a worst case scenario you could cut the wires on the dangling socket and the adapter and wirenut them together but i dont think thatd change the warmth issue
DIY,not_removed,that socket should have a springy tab on it so it can snap into the top of the can they usually come without them snapped in because some people put the eyeball gimbals on them
DIY,not_removed,just installed these in my bathroom they are halo recessed light fixture from the big box store i got the with water proof leds that socket does attach at the top of the fixture as others have said they are made for incandescent bulbs so they take a lot of heat so stop worrying check the top again they click into a slot i promise
DIY,not_removed,sorry to threadjack but i have a question if a guy wanted to install these lights in his basement ceiling finished drywall but uninsulated do you think these clips they have would hold the cans in place lights i know they dont have a lot of weight but i guess im just curious about something not screwed into wood thoughts
DIY,not_removed,after realizing that the socket was ceramic not plastic and the wires should be able to handle the heat i has stopped worrying about it am i right to do that
DIY,not_removed,yes i understand the light is getting warm from being onand not from the socket i just didnt want the socket to get too warm
DIY,not_removed,nothing to snap them in on i looked
DIY,not_removed,every company makes their set ups a little differently the piece youre talking about is a mount for the socket to clip into on the trim itself most led kits dont use this since the socket doesnt have to be straight and ou can use spring clips to hold the kit in the can
DIY,not_removed,yea those are fine but if you have a stud close and cant get the clip to lock you can take the clip out and try to get a drywall screw into the joist when you put them in try to bend the clips open a little and when trying to lock them dont hit them too hard or itll tear the aluminum housing
DIY,not_removed,you can stop worrying about it
DIY,not_removed,awesome thank you
DIY,not_removed,short of putting a strong fan at the bottom of the stairs no this is why many swamp coolers are roof mounted cold air sinks
DIY,not_removed,i put a ceiling fan in my entryway landing to updown stairs to pull cool air up in the summer and push the heat down in the winter it works but make sure to get one with high air movement
DIY,not_removed,thank you for posting to rdiy your submission has been removed please do some research before bringing your question to rdiy please read this entire message before you reply and before you contact the moderators about your post we love questions however we should not be your first stop when you run into a problem or have a question search this subreddit using the search box in the sidebar to see if someone has already solved your problem before use google to do general background research on your topic if those searches dont turn up an answer to your specific question please include the details of your research when you ask your question here so that we dont cover the same ground again provide as much detail as possible if you have a question about a product device or material try contacting the manufacturer or browse their website and try to find the answer there you have a couple of options if youve already done research please resubmit your question and describe what you have learned from that research and your resulting questions go ahead and do some research and resubmit your question after you have done so tell the reader what you researched and what questions you still have additionally consider the stickied rdiyaboutsticky thread at the top of rdiy for your question if applicable we encourage you to read the httpswwwredditcomrdiywikiguidelines for more information if you believe this is a mistake please thank you
DIY,not_removed,its overall a decent theme but the change in vertical spacing especially padding makes it far less informationdense overall good job and the new filtering system is fantastic thanks for your hard work mods
DIY,not_removed,filter posts i love you so many subs still do the useless lang system it is nice to see a sub do it the proper way also nice touch forcing legacy search and hiding res options very clean
DIY,not_removed,damn nice job i like the flairs
DIY,not_removed,whats the difference between carpentry and woodworking honest question
DIY,not_removed,great job folks looks great
DIY,not_removed,no likey at all kinda hurts
DIY,not_removed,i just noticed uqtx updated our mobile icon too you sneaky bastard love it to those of you using res nightmode in particular please let us know any strangeness you see thanks
DIY,not_removed,looks great
DIY,not_removed,its kinda difficult to quickly distinguish the black notseen links over the grey clicked links i
DIY,not_removed,looks great nice work
DIY,not_removed,just glancing at it is already much easier on the eyes not that you needed it but i approve
DIY,not_removed,isnt it in the rules if you build something to show step by step not just the final result
DIY,not_removed,does it need to be spaced out so far compared to the standard reddit theme we get less posts per page also the colours really dont contrast that well its difficult to read the number of votes and the difference between the followed and unfollwed links is difficult to see
DIY,not_removed,did you really use pressure treated wood in your new style sheet youre going to have to rip that out
DIY,not_removed,as long as you guys did it yourselves and didnt have someone else do it
DIY,not_removed,love the look nice work
DIY,not_removed,you can send all your thanks to uqtx hes the css master of this
DIY,not_removed,carpentry is more i built a garage woodworking is more i built a desk i realize its a fine line and may be adjusted at some point
DIY,not_removed,could you explain how its still very mellow
DIY,not_removed,what sub
DIY,not_removed,can you provide a screenshot as well as your browser and operating system information
DIY,not_removed,yeah same here not a great colour scheme
DIY,not_removed,i cant even tell you how many bans were going to give ourselves over the flagrant disregard of our own rules
DIY,not_removed,so agreedthe spacing is terribly off and the color scheme is unpleasant
DIY,not_removed,youre gonna be incredibly disappointed in us
DIY,not_removed,adding to this the distinction is different in different cultures the above generally holds in the us but the reverse is true in some locations and in others theyre entirely interchangable
DIY,not_removed,cant speak to his opinion but the flairs are way too big the spacing way too muchi have to scroll three pages just to see the key explaining the flairs lots of big white spaces in the sidebar
DIY,not_removed,windows on pc
DIY,not_removed,what browser
DIY,not_removed,google chrome
DIY,not_removed,thanks well see what can be done about that
DIY,not_removed,normal cement or mortar cement should work fine theres no point in digging out the dirt youre only creating a cavity behind the wall which you can never refill
DIY,not_removed,there is no solution you will have to tear the house down and rebuild
DIY,not_removed,thanks
DIY,not_removed,use hydraulic cement it holds up better to moisture and water than regular cement
DIY,not_removed,well thats it ive decided im just gonna buy cotton candy
DIY,not_removed,oh my god it is brilliant
DIY,not_removed,stupidly dangerous
DIY,not_removed,this guys accent is the wonder of the world
DIY,not_removed,loving this just the good old diy hack pretty much anyone can throw together
DIY,not_removed,
DIY,not_removed,thanks
DIY,not_removed,yet strangely elegant
DIY,not_removed,wonder is that you cant determine which countrys this accent is
DIY,not_removed,just like a lightsaber

DIY,not_removed,for the edging you plan to have the exposed does the trim piece terminate nicely for a table i feel like most would make the edges raised and i think for a table that would be a little weird do you think you could just cut the edge pieces at degrees and glue it to keep it the same finish and more table like edge
DIY,not_removed,is it tongue and groove flooring you could make a pretty solid table top with a kreg jig and some pocket screws i would also consider insetting the around the perimeter an inch or so as the will have a rounded edge that wont sit flush with anything
DIY,not_removed,its hardwood
DIY,not_removed,i was planning to base the edging off of by using two quarter round molding pieces gluing them together and then nailing it level with the countertop to get so the molding would overlap them a tiny bit and id just paint the visible white or something havent bought any trim yet so your idea is something i will keep in mind im going to lay everything out when i have some free time to get a better idea of what ill do thank you for the suggestion i appreciate it
DIY,not_removed,you should be able to find round stock so you dont have to glue two rounds maybe not at lowes or home depot but its likely at a shop a cabinet shop would be able to order for you if you dont a good lumber yard
DIY,not_removed,great thank you and should i be concerned about bowing with the or will that be alright
DIY,not_removed,im assuming you want the lights to change colors you can buy led screw type bulbs or a roll of rgb led strip lights that change colors with small hand held remotes

DIY,not_removed,i dont know how people can put heavy things on the wall right above their head i cant even sleep if theres a picture frame there out of fear that it will fall and smack me while i sleep
DIY,not_removed,sounds like something rpalletfurniture would like nice job
DIY,not_removed,its beautiful did you come up with the artwork for the stencil yourself
DIY,not_removed,thats why i used such strong wire and drilled wood screws into the studs in the wall i do not want this thing coming down on me
DIY,not_removed,ive knocked many framed posters of the joker off the wall in my sleep
DIY,not_removed,in college my friend had a stop sign that was propped up against the wall and resting on his headboard was quite funny when it fell playing mario
DIY,not_removed,odd question but how would i share it with that subreddit just resubmit in theirs ive never done that before
DIY,not_removed,nope my girlfriend found a pattern online she liked we put the jpeg on a flash drive and took it to office depot and they blew it up for us
DIY,not_removed,good precautions wouldnt be enough for me but ill readily admit im overly paranoid about things like this
DIY,not_removed,thats what id worry about with a framed poster ok itll hurt but it probably wont be too serious still enough for me to avoid putting anything on the wall above me though this thing fuck that id either get the entire weight of it in my stomach my crotch or my throat within a week of putting it on the wall i am not a stationary sleeper
DIY,not_removed,yep just post again common etiquette is to put something like xpost rdiy in the title so that people know where it started xpost just means cross post
DIY,not_removed,would you mind explaining the process of transferring the print to the contact paper i want to do something similar but am unsure on how to make the stencil thanks
DIY,not_removed,no theres wire on the pack and rests on wood screws that i drilled into studs in the wall
DIY,not_removed,ill give it a shot thank you
DIY,not_removed,yeah man sure thing a point to clarify before i start and to make the process make a little more sense the contact paper we used silhouette doublesided adhesive paper was essentially inch sheets of clear double sided tape with wax paper on either side one side white one side yellow so that when you peeled off one side that side became sticky the other side still had the glossy finish and was not sticky so we got the picture printed on a big sheet of paper like i said and we laid it face down then we peeled of one side of the contact paper and pressed it sticky side down to the back of sheet once we had covered the entire pattern feel free to cut the sheets in half triangles etc we peeled off the other side of protective covering from the contact paper please note its pretty important to not have extra space between sheets of contact paper itll mess up the stencil from there just flip the sheet over and press it down to the woodsurface youll be working with use a razor blade or xacto knife to cute out the ink and then paint
DIY,not_removed,call them and ask
DIY,not_removed,you are better off using an enamel paint or pigmented lacquer rather than latex latex paint tends to take a long time to fully dry and can feel sticky for months it is also hard to touch up if you have a blemish
DIY,not_removed,i am an sw employee proclassic comes in both latex and oil based variants either option should work fine for furniture proclassic is an enamel paint that gives a harder finish which makes it ideal for trim woodwork cabinets furniture and doors i have sold it to people many times for furniture use and have not had an issues the choice between latex or oil in this case would come down to your preference but oil might get better adhesion to the desk i also would suggest roughing the surface to help with adhesion and using a primer also sherwinwilliams is currently having a sale through july so now would be a good time to get the paint since proclassic is more expensive than normal wall paints

DIY,not_removed,or i could get someone elses experience with it and see their pros cons the sherwin williams employee is just gonna read off the can
DIY,not_removed,the paint im asking about sw pro classic acrylic is a water based alkyd enamel paint not latex
DIY,not_removed,this is as good if or better for cabinets and furniture httpwwwbenjaminmoorecomenusforyourhomepaintproductsadvancewaterborneinterioralkydpaint with this as a good primer
DIY,not_removed,not really the employees have an internal help line with experienced developers of the paint at their disposal call them
DIY,not_removed,water bases is considered latex
DIY,not_removed,do you use the fire place because i feel the tv would fit perfectly in front of it maybe you could find a system that allow the tv to be move up and down rails cables above the fireplace when you want to light a fire and down at eye level when you want to watch tv edit yes definitely paint that fireplace
DIY,not_removed,no opinion on the tv i dont watch much so over the fireplace would be fine for me that fireplace tho omg what a disaster the brick work is either bad or the guy was high when he laid it out it looks like some of the brick sticking out and broken off paint would help peeling off that brick and replacing it with something else would be better imo
DIY,not_removed,looks very out of place to me
DIY,not_removed,honestly it looks awful like someone else said get something that will let you raise and lower it the way you have it now would be horrible for watching

DIY,not_removed,thanks we do plan to use the fireplace the rails are a great suggestion
DIY,not_removed,thanks for your honest observation the fireplace has been driving me crazy
DIY,not_removed,they make mantle mounts which can drop down and out up to downwards some even come with heat sensing to let you know if its too hot they arent cheap though
DIY,not_removed,yeah that brick doesnt look to be part of the structure of the chimney or part of the chimney at all demo the brick and reinstall some rock or other brick with your tv height in mind
DIY,not_removed,comments and feedback are appreciated i did this over the weekend while my gf was out of town it was nice to be able to do a project from start to finish in a relatively short time with the tools i already own since im still super new at this thats really rewarding i havent refinished the top because i dont know what i can do with the veneer looking for tips on that price breakdown top free wood for rails and legs metal rail dealie hardware stain for a new can but i barely used any
DIY,not_removed,i think it looks great this has always been a project i would like to do
DIY,not_removed,love the finish this looks great
DIY,not_removed,nicely done i really like the legs on it looks very professional
DIY,not_removed,thanks may not be conventionnal i use floor varnish to seal it up the stein is canadien maple from saman
DIY,not_removed,i love your house where do you live it looks beautiful include address and what time you go to work and get home
DIY,not_removed,nice work i really love the gate i probably wouldnt have thought of it
DIY,not_removed,no critique no criticismjust a friendly well done it looks great
DIY,not_removed,can you post a couple more photos of the outside of your house looks like a set from little house on the prairie with that porch and hanging flower pot really nice
DIY,not_removed,lovely skirt and you have a beautiful house what is the metal grille underneath the stairs for
DIY,not_removed,nicely photo documented
DIY,not_removed,its the little things
DIY,not_removed,i dont see that you used any adhesive on the blocks but you should have a few tubes of landscape adhesive will keep those blocks in place and prevent them from shifting
DIY,not_removed,i would mount and mate that beautiful house
DIY,not_removed,do you have experience in carpentrywoodworking just curious if someone who has no experienceknowledge can do something like this by themselves
DIY,not_removed,omg i literally started drooling when i looked at this
DIY,not_removed,im amazed at what a difference it makes you have a really beautiful house and you did before but that skirt really ties it together nicely really goes to show that some elbow grease can go a long way nicely done looks wonderful and smart move putting the gate in i imagine it will make fishing the cat out a lot easier also unrelated that emerald green accent is really pretty
DIY,not_removed,i love this definitely saving this thread for the future
DIY,not_removed,do you have any photos of the porcupines
DIY,not_removed,are you airbnbing it
DIY,not_removed,very very nice work
DIY,not_removed,pretty
DIY,not_removed,dude you got skills mad skills props and beautiful job
DIY,not_removed,thank you to the person who gilded this post
DIY,not_removed,very nice but a darker stain like in the before picture would compliment the colors of the rest of the house better
DIY,not_removed,whats the point of a skirt and why the grill on the dirt
DIY,not_removed,thank you i live in new hampshire
DIY,not_removed,thanks here is when the neighbors pony showed up at my house here it is last winter we didnt have much snow
DIY,not_removed,well the metal grille was already there when i bought the house and i left it i believe it was there to deter animals from digging
DIY,not_removed,happy cake day i didnt use any adhesive hopefully they dont shift around but i guess only time will tell luckily its not a lot of block good call
DIY,not_removed,i have a little experience but i think anyone with patience and time could do this job i purchased a new sliding compound miter saw since i was doing this i didnt need it but it was an excuse to buy it it made the job easier but it could have been done with a hand held saw this took me months to finish the main thing i did right was to take my time thinking measuring measuring again and cutting when i didnt know what to do i asked my brother or searched online if you put your mind to it with patience you can do it
DIY,not_removed,will the future ever come i have tons of things i want to do in the future s
DIY,not_removed,nope just living here
DIY,not_removed,the pictures make the color look a bit worse than in person i choose the stain to match the old stain and the old wood stairs and top matches pretty well to what was there the house stain is a different type of stain then the porch the new wood is lighter which is why i will be staining again in the spring
DIY,not_removed,if you read the descriptions he mentioned there were porcupines getting underneath
DIY,not_removed,i live in san diego definitely think id freeze to death there lol
DIY,not_removed,your house is just confirming my want to move to new hampshire more and more
DIY,not_removed,that much snow would close roads and schools in my country
DIY,not_removed,not the house are you airbnbing the porch pic makes it looks livable

DIY,not_removed,yep youre golden dont take my word for it i know nothing about this type of thing
DIY,not_removed,probably not loadbearing im all for diy but without knowing for certain what the builder incorporated into the structure that seems like a job for a professional
DIY,not_removed,it looks like some of the trusses would have to be supported by the chimney so youd need to figure out how to support them when the chimney is gone why are you removing it it would look nice with some dry stack on it
DIY,not_removed,as for the roof you will have to do some framing you will know what when you get the chimney down to roof level i would be concerned that that big bulkhead wall may be using the brick for support just the way there its built makes me wonder just so you know that chimney is made out of a lot more brick than you might think this is not a one man afternoon job i would recommend getting a good contractor with a few guys to do this pretty big diy job have built them and taken them down so i know

DIY,not_removed,sweet thanks for the go ahead ill begin the demo right away woooo
DIY,not_removed,dang i suppose ill have to look for another project to do this weekend i appreciate your feedback
DIY,not_removed,mainly cause it takes up a lot of space in an already small living room i live in the humid and hot south annnd removing thst tacky blue paint is a bitch huh this dry stack you speak of can you apply to the brick
DIY,not_removed,what about one man whole days woo of july and a lot of beer seriously though the more i think about it it seems a little beyond my diy span
DIY,not_removed,no problem start at the base and then work your way up if you take any advice from me youre crazy im making this shit up as i go
DIY,not_removed,even if it isnt load bearing youre going to be left with a big fireplace sized hole in your roof
DIY,not_removed,trust me a wood burning chimney is one solid mass of brick the brick you see is just facing brick lots more under it just go up and take it down to the roof and you will see what i mean although generally the part above the roof is not as bad good call one man no way
DIY,not_removed,i figured the base would be a good starting point considering i dont have a sturdy ladder i would gild you if i could
DIY,not_removed,save your money for the project my advice is free of charge thats because its worthless
DIY,not_removed,youve saved me so much money i found some gold
DIY,not_removed,are you really as ignorant as you sound
DIY,not_removed,it was mere banter with whoop and then i supported reddit for entertaining me and giving me direction dont fret
DIY,not_removed,sorry i wasnt fretting all whoop aside though i was a bit concerned about the bottom up approach your chimney by lawcode should not have any contact with the roof framing as such removing it shouldnt be a problem structurally
DIY,not_removed,i do appreciate the genuine concern i was unaware of said lawcode guess it depends on if the builder followed it
DIY,not_removed,you didnt build this karma stealing asshat
DIY,not_removed,did you
DIY,not_removed,this is the droid im looking for
DIY,not_removed,this deserves front page great work
DIY,not_removed,

DIY,not_removed,if i had half of this kind of a patience with a project my house wouldnt be filled with deconstructed toys and i would have cabinet doors in my kitchen
DIY,not_removed,most impressive

DIY,not_removed,that is so damn cool for a little balcony such an easy way to have a little vertical garden thanks for sharing forwarded it to a friend with a tiny balcony and a need for a herbs garden really good job tomatoes may need more soil but should work as well
DIY,not_removed,hi everyone this is my first post and first bigger build please leave me some feedback be kind and leave comments i appreciate it if you have any questions please ask
DIY,not_removed,houzz worthy httpwwwhouzzcom
DIY,not_removed,awesome unfortunately if it were mine i would manage to kill every single plant on it i am the scourge of all plant life
DIY,not_removed,very cool where did you find the clothing rack
DIY,not_removed,yeah this is a great idea you cant tell it used to be a clothing rack these pop up for free occasionally i should grab one next time
DIY,not_removed,i cannot confirm this but i heard pressure treated wood can leak chemicals into the lawn and garden if you dont stain or seal it properly can anyone confirm or deny this with a source
DIY,not_removed,why thank you im sure someone with a balcony could really appreciate this it could be made deeper for tomatoes and other vegetables i may use the other side for that
DIY,not_removed,im floored
DIY,not_removed,thank you for the compliment i will be using it like that at some point the vines are getting much bigger and i plan to have them expand scores the entire thing into a lush green wall
DIY,not_removed,thank you usually thats me as well for some reason everything on this manages to stay alive no clue as to how
DIY,not_removed,no problem im aware of this already it will be a while before that happens but it will happen at some point no doubt about that ill make a better base when it finally does
DIY,not_removed,dicks sporting goods was renovating and we picked it up whats even cooler is that i have more coming my way
DIY,not_removed,you should absolutely grab one it was so simple and easy to make but looks gorgeous i would be flattered to have people try this
DIY,not_removed,to clarify i know op did stain the wood im just wondering if there are alternatives to pressure treated wood or if staining it is safe enough on its own
DIY,not_removed,very nice
DIY,not_removed,do exactly like you said and if you can grt a longer piece from upstairs so to make the counter top over the dishwasher a solid piece so there isnt a seam over the dishwasher
DIY,not_removed,cut back the countertop over the dishwasher and make a butcher block to go over it
DIY,not_removed,ive used this website as my goto reference for my current shower remodel wwwdavehennesseycomshowerpanman
DIY,not_removed,here is my shower i poured my own pan too
DIY,not_removed,i used the quick pitch system to build my shower but also used wedi on the walls you could just as easily use cementboard and seal with redguard here is my build you can see i used the plastic cover to protect the weep holes another great resource is httpwwwjohnbridgecomvbulletin the site is frequented by professionals who are always willing to give advice
DIY,not_removed,wood screws you should be fine the screws compress the wood against each other the friction between the two boards is what provides the shear strength if you get really concerned just run a couple lag bolts from the ledger board into the joists behind the wall
DIY,not_removed,this is just me but id have used lag bolts with flat washers

DIY,not_removed,if you remove the glass you could make a wall planter for succulents etc or again no glass place a velvet back on it and use the for jewellery hanging pictures frame mirror
DIY,not_removed,you could melt the glass down and make some sort of sweet apparatus
DIY,not_removed,add leds behind it and put it on the wall
DIY,not_removed,if you arent married yet or you have kids who are not still living in your basement save it for the wedding clean it up a bit freshen up the paint if you want and then turn it into basically the frame for a collage of pictures that you can put near the guest book
DIY,not_removed,you should build a house

DIY,not_removed,i really love the floral design on the glass though so i would like to keep that and recreate it into some sort of furniture
DIY,not_removed,this is a phenomenal idea
DIY,not_removed,uummm you could stick the glass parallel to eachother onto a wooden base sides possibly the wood from here and place led or fairy lights between the gap in the glass or similar put the glass onto a piece of wood and attach wooden sides create a plant box if you can cut glass turn it into a lidless box for nick nacks or again cut glass turn it into jewellery
DIY,not_removed,i agree with you on the results still think part of the problem is that is not a fine enough grit for finish i always go to and maybe even that said if the saw dust is clumping up the sanders it almost seems like a curing problem with the stock too wet not dried or seasoned well before being assembled using uncured wood is the only time i encountered this type of problem usually most hardwoods age for a year before being milled then either kiln dried or set on stickers to dry for another year before use you can you tub a home wood curing solar kiln for future projects to see where i am coming from anyway good luck and at least you showed the fortitude needed to learn your own solution to a problem keep on diying
DIY,not_removed,make a frame from straight lumber and glue the foam board to the frame
DIY,not_removed,foamcore art supplies stores sell this sold in sheets up to by super light weight staples may carry it comes in white or black paintable paper on the outside lightweight foam core
DIY,not_removed,is your ceiling flat just paint a white square where you want to project
DIY,not_removed,corrugated plastic sheet or cardboard if the texture on it doesnt work with the projector wrap a white bed sheet around it and attach on the back side
DIY,not_removed,check out plascore it is a honeycomb panel that is very very stiff and lightweight httpwwwplascorecomhoneycombhoneycombpanelsplascorepanels
DIY,not_removed,httpwwwcarlofetcomprojectorscreenmaterialhtml i purchased some material here and stretched it over a frame for my screen i made a screen and it is awesome
DIY,not_removed,its got that stupid spackle stuff all over it i rent by the way so i cant do too much modification
DIY,not_removed,the problem with cardboard is that it isnt rigid enough and sags spicythunders suggestion of making some kind of frame would probably help with that though
DIY,not_removed,yeah textures a problem you could reinforce the foam board take some extra strips of foam about inches wide and glue them to the back of the main board to create ribs you could stack strips per rib if the material is thin and still bends
DIY,not_removed,anything corrugated isnt going to be perfectly flat and smooth though there will be hundreds of small valleys that will distort the projection
DIY,not_removed,i think the corrugated plastic is less likely to sag but either could be easily solved by attaching it to the ceiling in multiple locations especially where it sags
DIY,not_removed,i cant believe i didnt think of reinforcing it with some kind of a frame thats a really good idea
DIY,not_removed,agreed hence my suggestion to wrap a white bed sheet around it
DIY,not_removed,awesome we are doing a similar conversion in our house and i hope it turns out this well
DIY,not_removed,looks good is the door connected to the hallway or to the room it would get pretty annoying having to walk to a different room through hallway to get your clothes all the time and would this effect resale going by the picture and plans it doesnt look like your relocated the access
DIY,not_removed,damnit when i saw slaapkamer i realised you were either dutch or belgian a minute later i knew and i couldnt help but read everything in a horrible dutchaccented english i didnt help that you guys look totally dutch coming from a belgian p also nice work
DIY,not_removed,this looks fantastic perhaps a mirror against the door if i may be so bold
DIY,not_removed,good luck
DIY,not_removed,yep its still connected to the hallway the same way this way the room can easily be converted back to a separate bedroom which i think is better for the resale value we find having to move through the hallway not to be annoying at all since the bathroom is also not connected to the bedroom and we have to move through the hallway anyway
DIY,not_removed,i think he mentioned theres a mirror on the wall behind the door
DIY,not_removed,like others said there is a mirror behind the door i just dont have a picture of it we considered putting the mirror on the door but it would have been offcenter of the room and not look nice
DIY,not_removed,sounds like theyre gonna be there for a while if theyre considering the possibility of changing the floors even if they decide to sell the closet structure is only semipernanent and can be removed
DIY,not_removed,its not really permanent if they took out that window it would be the way they did it half a days worth of careful demo and its back to a bedroom
DIY,not_removed,quite right
DIY,not_removed,thats right the closet can be removed and the room will be back to original again if we ever want to sell the house we would still list this room as a bedroom but leave the closet in so the next buyers can decide to keep it or not we still have three remaining bedrooms so im not too worried
DIY,not_removed,that means that it would either list with one less bedroom or they would have to spend the time and money to return it to the way it was
DIY,not_removed,well the changing from bedroom to closet would slice one bedroom off not sure it would make a huge difference in value but who knows it might
DIY,not_removed,please let it gobthrough
DIY,not_removed,
DIY,not_removed,thats a great idea i like the end result
DIY,not_removed,i love these vertical gardens great job for those that dont want to cut firehouse and whatnot a behindthedoor shoe rack achieves the same desired design
DIY,not_removed,what makes these a good material for a pot water isnt able to drain can it
DIY,not_removed,it looks great very clever
DIY,not_removed,ya im a big fan of herbal gardens
DIY,not_removed,really like the herb garden would it be possible to use something like this it is polyester so would i need to cut some holes at the buttom alternatively what would you recomend instead of a firehose
DIY,not_removed,im not familiar with ballard local store
DIY,not_removed,do you mind sharing which superstore you picked up the herbs from
DIY,not_removed,only the inner sleeve that i removed is water tight the outer sleeve is just thick canvas
DIY,not_removed,the fold over at the bottom coupled with the gravel at the bottom should provide ample room for drainage even if the material is not very permeable
DIY,not_removed,youre correct op just needs to be careful about overwatering and watch for signs of root rot hopefully they live somewhere dry with little rain
DIY,not_removed,i actually tried this in the past using a product like this the one i got had quite small pockets compared to the firehose which made planting tricky if you could find one where the pockets are sized for shoes instead of that would probably be ideal
DIY,not_removed,yep a second usesalvage place in seattle
DIY,not_removed,fred meyer
DIY,not_removed,oh so it can drain
DIY,not_removed,gravel will hurt drainage perched water table
DIY,not_removed,ballard reuse is in seattle so not a little rain
DIY,not_removed,okay thanks for the feedback ill see what i can find
DIY,not_removed,in this case its just loose gravel its not under extreme pressure nor are there enough sediments to form an impermeable layer to clog drainage it is definitely not enough to impact drainage
DIY,not_removed,water does not perch on gravel it perches on fine grained sediments like clay
DIY,not_removed,razor scraper i did this with carpet glue over vintage brick for about sf youll get about sq feet an hour if you are lucky some spots i was lucky to get sf a day that floor looks much easier than over brick buy some kneepads and replacement razors there isnt an easy answer that will make it look good power tools will do more harm than good edit just realized that you are going to put down epoxy wire grind it and use a double amount of epoxy its selflevelling
DIY,not_removed,that mastic likely contains asbestos be careful with grinding
DIY,not_removed,rent a floor polisher with abrasive pad i took floor paint off my basement floor with that a pump sprayer to keep the floor damp worked like a dreamt to pull up the paint without making clouds of dust took me about hours to do ft
DIY,not_removed,what you going to put back down to clean the floor maybe wire wheel on grinder make sure to ware thick gloves and safety glasses
DIY,not_removed,ok then try wire wheel i use one at work to clean up rust and crud off metal
DIY,not_removed,mastic remover
DIY,not_removed,or just skim coat with new connie
DIY,not_removed,i had one in my hand at the store i will try this out wire is worth a look too
DIY,not_removed,thanks getting it tested before i do anything stupid
DIY,not_removed,and wear a serious face mask if you do this
DIY,not_removed,i planned on using a garage floor epoxy and then get some rugs so as not to be standing on bare concrete thinking more of a shop than a fully finished basement

DIY,not_removed,try rwoodworking and rfinishing
DIY,not_removed,is it the tub itself tile grout or caulk that is being stubborn black is mold and should be able to be scrubbed off the sides of the tub with any abrasive cleaner such as comet the tile is porous and if heavily molded you may have to use if its the caulk you will have to dig out the old and recaulk
DIY,not_removed,try to throw more beach into it dont think youve added enough
DIY,not_removed,im not sure if it would be strong enough because ive never had an acrylic tub but would baking soda and vinegar be too mild it seems to work with everything else lol
DIY,not_removed,try zud not a joke
DIY,not_removed,white vinegar and dish soap put both components in a spray bottle and slowly turn the bottle a few times to mix them up without actually shaking it spray liberally let it sit for minutes scrub rinse with hot water while scrubbing some more and repeat if theres any residue left source used this method to remove decades old soap scum and hard water build up on the tubshower in my house after we moved in
DIY,not_removed,your post has been removed questions about cleaning are not allowed here try rhomeimprovement
DIY,not_removed,if this doesnt work youll have to if you use this dont clean it with bleach
DIY,not_removed,how big are you looking for plywood size bigger smaller price
DIY,not_removed,there are so many products out there its difficult to define what is best without knowing more lets guess anyway for simple cabinet making you cant beat laminate or melamine its cheap looks great if done properly and lasts a fair time indoors there is also a few rediscovered items like bamboo thats been fashioned into a plywood theres lists of plastic and foam that could prove useful for short term structures could be considered interesting as well foam with plaster cladding has long been a staple in set designs i know some companies are using foam as formworks even for concrete good luck on your project

DIY,not_removed,the second finished picture is better
DIY,not_removed,its gonna be huuuge believe me op before starting this build hah pretty sweet build man where is that looks like a good shop space
DIY,not_removed,a table for dominos here i was expecting a lacquered table with huge domino dots gouged into it
DIY,not_removed,pretty damn sweet love the grain of that maple
DIY,not_removed,that is really awesome is it ok if i make a suggestion
DIY,not_removed,it is the woodshop of my university
DIY,not_removed,it turned out great
DIY,not_removed,i hope it is not too late for your input
DIY,not_removed,i can tell you one thing i and j should stay unless you like intermittent cold water in the shower from the tankless oven
DIY,not_removed,thanks for the reply ill probably change i and j to the tankless water accepts a pipe which is why i chose but ill probably run then reduce it i was oversizing for the oven just like the clothes dryer i realize is more realistic and thats with every burner and the broiler on i just wanted to have the option of buying something a little higher end in the future
DIY,not_removed,what is your gas meter rated at
DIY,not_removed,your sizing is close im a licensed gas fitter and if i were to do your house this is what i would do as long as all the measurements shown here are for the length of your gas lines are correct a b c d e f g h i j k l
DIY,not_removed,yes but only for pipe sizes and over because its welded pipe and works at different pressures the chart you possibly looked and and the chart i use account for elbows and tees already ive done much bigger and longer gas lines then the one shown here and for the sizing chart youd use you would never have to account for elbows and tees
DIY,not_removed,retard hire a professional before you blow up your family clearly you have no idea being a cheap ass isnt worth your family
DIY,not_removed,its a bit confusing the plate on the front of it says cfh but i called them and they said its cfh either way i think ill have to get it replaced
DIY,not_removed,thanks for this i changed my diagram to exactly what you said with the exception of b c d which is already there can i ask you something though i vaguely remember reading somewhere that for each tee and elbow youre supposed to add feet is there something to that i think either way im fine
DIY,not_removed,thanks so much
DIY,not_removed,there are btu in a cubic foot of ng if you have btu of load your meter may be undersized
DIY,not_removed,no problem
DIY,not_removed,get free pallets
DIY,not_removed,do you can about looks or just function you can build one out of these plastic containers httpalleycatadvocatesorgassetsrubbermaidpng you use two slightly different sized ones and then put insulation in between

DIY,not_removed,and you can win it if the price is right
DIY,not_removed,nice build question on attaching the cooler to the frame did you just run the screws up through the bottom and partially into the cooler and on the lid through the frame sides into the cooler lid
DIY,not_removed,yes i did it seems to hold very well and it allows them to be removable in the future im open to suggestions on a better design too if you have any ideas
DIY,not_removed,only complaint was i had to go through pictures before i finally got to see the kangaroo with the santa hat other than that really really well done
DIY,not_removed,wow thats a lot of photos
DIY,not_removed,wow great work also i had no idea that they made one of those drill press type attachments for a drill to help drill straight holes i definitely need one of those
DIY,not_removed,i think i seriously lost half an hour reading this album great job though

DIY,not_removed,i had that implosion problem before i just doubled up on trash cans and that worked fine until i got a fiber drum
DIY,not_removed,why did you spend so much time adjusting for the glue up when you used the router to flatten the top anyways or why not glue in smaller sections first to avoid having to use the large clamps on all the boards at once
DIY,not_removed,i now have arthritis and need a new scroll wheel but it was worth it great job
DIY,not_removed,actually went through the the photos worth it

DIY,not_removed,its voilà not whallah
DIY,not_removed,any way to get a few shots for us on mobile
DIY,not_removed,thank you for sharing i in particular appreciate your attention to errors and troubles i hope to avoid these same concerns when and if i ever get to build my own also rwoodworking my appreciate your indepth analysis better than the short attention span crew in rdiy
DIY,not_removed,awesome i was cracking up over the imploding trash can
DIY,not_removed,you might want to rethink how the top is connected to the legs everything else is over engineered thats a good thing but you only have four bolts holding the top on theres not a lot there to prevent racking and the leg vice is going to put a lot of shearing force on your top when clamping it will try to push it off the legs but otherwise well done a good workbench is a heavy workbench
DIY,not_removed,i was like no way am i going through photos for a workbench
DIY,not_removed,i thougt the same thing
DIY,not_removed,ok taking half an hour off todays timesheet totally worth it
DIY,not_removed,was wondering about that did you have to seal the cans or do anything to prevent air leaks
DIY,not_removed,the closer you get during the glue up the less you have to take off while flattening since i was worried about getting the bench too thin i wanted to make sure i got it as good as possible early on i glued up in smaller sections on my first attempt and it turned out even worse for this i would have been more accurate with less gaps if i had glued up all boards at once instead of doing half at a time whatever imperfections are baked into the smaller pieces tend to magnify when you glue together all the smaller chunks later if you do it all at once you can align all boards and pull and tap them into place while everything is still wet but if you do it in smaller sections you cant see that its going to be slightly out of wack with the other sections and it dries that way hopefully that makes sense
DIY,not_removed,lol a mental connection was just made that should have been made many many years ago thanks for that
DIY,not_removed,when i get home tonight ill put a few completed ones up for you
DIY,not_removed,thanks and id already xposted to woodworking general consensus is that they dont appreciate something quite so indepth
DIY,not_removed,im not too worried the leg vice doesnt need to clamp down with the force of a hydraulic press just enough to keep the work from moving also as long as the work is more than it will also be clamped against the leg which is flush with the top edge the one holeinsert in hard maple thats keeping the top from racking should be ok as long as i dont go too crazy with the clamp but ill keep an eye on it in my test pieces for the threaded inserts i had a hard time realigning the insert with a hammer so im hopeful thanks for the tip
DIY,not_removed,holy shit i went through photos op should slide show narrate this easy minute video
DIY,not_removed,about fiber drums or doubling up trash cans doubling trashcans just the one connecting to the cyclone needs to be sealed the second one is there for structural support for fiber drums the lid and snap ring lock sealed enough but some people apply a silicon bead around the ring let it dry and use it as a gasket
DIY,not_removed,sweet thanks
DIY,not_removed,here you go that should just be pics highlighting the main features
DIY,not_removed,that is really cool awesome work
DIY,not_removed,why dont you google lifeguard chair dimensions and find something you like its all relative depends how high you want the seat who will be using it essentially the side of the chair is a ladder you could go anywhere from spacing between rungs to spacing beyond that it gets too far for a lot of people esp the little kids that would likely be climbing it find some plans or dimensions to go from

DIY,not_removed,kintsugi is made with a lacquer with ground precious metals i can only think that you could do something similar with ground copper and a clear epoxy i would love to see how it turns out
DIY,not_removed,does the shape of the crack allow you to make a negative mould of it if it does you could cast the copper away from the wood and insert it after it had cooled
DIY,not_removed,heres an example of somebody who did something similar to what youre talking about but using aluminum copper melts at a higher temperature than aluminum so that might cause some issues for you
DIY,not_removed,use a metal powder in epoxy you might be able to find an alloy with a low enough temperature that you could apply it without toasting everything like a dental filling but really you are better off not messing with high temps
DIY,not_removed,water has an absurd heat capacity soaked wood might not burn if you poured molten copper into it of course it might also explode as the hot metal cracked the water into hydrogen and oxygen its an experiment probably best carried on outdoors edit sorry heat of vaporization not heat capacity
DIY,not_removed,only way i can think of is having some way to pressurize the molten copper to push it through a tube and push it into the cracks while the wood is submerged under water
DIY,not_removed,ive seen this done ground material epoxy with malachite and other colorful stones it looks quite nice once its all polished i expect that it would be doable with copper or other metals as well but youd have to put an additional layer of clear coatsealant once its polished if you want to prevent any exposed metal from oxidizing over time
DIY,not_removed,holy shit thats amazing
DIY,not_removed,i agree file down some copper tubing and mix it with slow setting epoxy ive done it with brass for inlays in instruments and it looks pretty badass
DIY,not_removed,youll get a steam explosion not cracked water molecules aint anywhere near hot enough for cracking
DIY,not_removed,wouldnt the wood just explodecrack then
DIY,not_removed,you can also making a casting pour the molten copper into the mold then install the metal into the surface when it cooled
DIY,not_removed,youd get a face full of hot steam when the copper contacted the water when the copper leaves the tube its going to superheat the water immediately surrounding it creating a steam bubble in the tank that steam has to go somewhere and its going to bring a bunch of other tank contents with it quickly
DIY,not_removed,uhmmm aint no steam explosion
DIY,not_removed,that or the water would explode before you even got to the wood mixing hot metal and water under pressure is a recipe for a problem
DIY,not_removed,uhmmm this aint no steam explosion actually yes yes it is pouring the copper onto the ice creates a pocket of steam that is trapped under the cooling copper if the copper cools fast enough you get a large pressure build up which splits the ice explosively the guy in the video is lucky he didnt get a face full of copper slag
DIY,not_removed,i believe it is actually
DIY,not_removed,at the very least the water would cool the metal too fast and you would have a rod of previously molten metal lol
DIY,not_removed,oh god damn it youre right that im wrong youre wrong too according to but that only makes me feel marginally better balls cant get this right
DIY,not_removed,youre wrong too according to this abstract but that only makes me feel marginally better you might want to give that abstract a reread a mechanism of thermal explosion is assumed by which jets observed experimentally of small particles from the bulk mass of the hot material trigger the phenomenon sudden phase transformations and combined internal stresses lead to copper fragmentation followed by a vapour explosion
DIY,not_removed,ohhh fuck ok i think i get it now theyre saying the copper shatters and the sudden contact between a shitton of hot finely divided copper and the water is what causes the explosion is that how youd interpret it
DIY,not_removed,right i read that part stresses in the copper is how i interpreted that no
DIY,not_removed,the abstract says this sudden phase transformation solidliquid to gas and microfractures in the copper result in the solidified copper breaking and allowing explosive release of the water vapor underneath
DIY,not_removed,see that just doesnt make sense to me not saying i know exactly what they mean without being able to see the paper but why would there be any pressure build up this is moltensolid copper and liquidgas water the copper wont stick to the water and its not that heavy why would there be high pressure under it the exact words which you quoted earlier were fragmentation followed by a vapor explosion my thinking at least once i took the time to read it more carefully was that the reason there was a vapor explosion wasnt that the vapor built up slowly and was suddenly released but that the vapor was created suddenly after the copper shatters dunno i guess i misinterpreted a lot of things about that video so i could be misinterpreting this too
DIY,not_removed,not saying i know exactly what they mean without being able to see the paper but why would there be any pressure build up when you turn water into a gas it rapidly expands if it cant expand the pressure increases until something gives or the system cools down this is moltensolid copper and liquidgas water the copper wont stick to the water and its not that heavy why would there be high pressure under it copper solidifying on ice will certainly give you a good enough seal to contain steam until the pressure hits a terminal point ever seen a grease fire explosion same principle the exact words which you quoted earlier were fragmentation followed by a vapor explosion correct the copper cap will crack and the steam will exit the pocket explosively my thinking at least once i took the time to read it more carefully was that the reason there was a vapor explosion wasnt that the vapor built up slowly and was suddenly released but that the vapor was created suddenly after the copper shatters close the vapor builds up rapidly then the copper cracks then the vapor explodes out of the cavity i guess i misinterpreted a lot of things about that video so i could be misinterpreting this too i think youre subconsciously assuming an explosion requires some type of combustion in this case combustion isnt needed for an explosion you only need three things a medium water vapor heat from the molten copper and pressure supplied by the rapidly expanding water vapor you could do the exact same thing without molten copper you just need something hot and liquid that will partially solidify when cooled to the temperature of ice
DIY,not_removed,the thing is im pretty sure this investigator is using liquid water check out same investigator different study he talks about water from which sounds like liquid water so there would be no seal and no pressure containment by the copper the english is a bit broken but again my interpretation of that abstract is that the copper shatters many hot copper particles with large surface area intermingle with water and flash boil it and the rapidly expanding steam explodes i really dont have any hangups about an expanding vapor cloud causing an explosion trust me ive seen exploded locomotives in old pictures thats an explosion no doubt dry ice bombs are an explosion of a sort absolutely its just that i dont see how pressure containment could happen here except perhaps in the really short timescale where the inertia of the copper traps the vapor under it as its generated but in the video the copper is just sitting there for a while there absolutely has to be liedenfrost boiling going on in the pool of melt under it i just cant believe its somehow sealed to the ice and then i could totally believe that if it shatters and hot molten and solid copper violently mixes with a shallow pool of melt under it there could be an explosion thats what im going to take away from this ill say this youve got me thinking more deeply about the different ways in which molten copper and water could go wrong than i ever though i would as the result of one errant comment i made ps i still think op could try soaking wood and filling the cracks especially if this blowing up phenomenon is about liquid water suddenly mixing with shattered copper i feel like the risk posed by damp wood might not be all that great although with an overhung cavity in wood that gets plugged with metal that might actually make a pressure vessel
DIY,not_removed,its just that i dont see how pressure containment could happen here except perhaps in the really short timescale where the inertia of the copper traps the vapor under it as its generated and thats exactly what happened but in the video the copper is just sitting there for a while there absolutely has to be liedenfrost boiling going on in the pool of melt under it i just cant believe its somehow sealed to the ice sure and once the outside edges of the copper cool enough for the liedenfrost effect to subside the seal forms but the steam production continues this is why the ice doesnt shatter immediately on contact with the copper i bet a slower pour would result in a different outcome
DIY,not_removed,aghhh i just dont get the seal concept doesnt seem right ahh well im not going to agree with every stranger on the internet ill have to keep thinking about this

DIY,not_removed,unsure if youre aware but your wife and your dog totally have a brianlois thing goin on
DIY,not_removed,definitely not the way i would build it putting the osb in like that would make for a lot of extra work should have put the legs on the outside and have the osb all on the inside with no weird cuts
DIY,not_removed,it would have been smarter to custom measure the shelves for the stuff youre actually going to store for example a decent sized shop vac is not gonna fit under that first shelf also if maximum storage is the goal why wouldnt you go as wide as you can and all the way to the ceiling that would have allowed for taller middle shelves aka more storage another note is overkill for garage shelving is way cheaper and is more than enough to hold your normal garage crap i know because i built one that has been sitting in my garage storing all my crap without any issues for years
DIY,not_removed,dont forget to anchor it to the studs in the wall
DIY,not_removed,looks nice
DIY,not_removed,definitely the harder way to do it with the shelf bottoms but it looks nicer because of it
DIY,not_removed,it would have been easier to reverse the side so that you dont have to cut the osb also i would have removed one shelf and with a bigger height from the bottom and the smaller shelves after that
DIY,not_removed,came here to say thisi can hear my boss from summer college jobs screaming at me were not building a piano frickenrighthedid

DIY,not_removed,if you think they cant remove it look at the way its cut the board was not mitered at all if its supporting anything all the load is on the nails and none of it on the board there is no way that board is supporting anything
DIY,not_removed,yes you can remove it that is just bracing used in construction once the roof deck is completed the roof itself takes care of it edit i was a construction supervisor for years and i get downvoted for being correct damn funny stuff
DIY,not_removed,it is a temporary brace to hold the rafters plum vertical until roof is completely formed i would remove it if it was in my attic im a carpenter if that helps
DIY,not_removed,an engineer would just look at it and kick it out the roof is your best truss system there and if your house was held by that measly board an engineer didnt design it engineers for most building structures work with big factors of safety because using more material is cheaper and safer than using less
DIY,not_removed,i wouldnt well i might if i were going to substitute some bracing for it for instance will you be building knee walls if so then i would add diagonal bracing inside there on either side also how prone is your home to wind at my house mph winds do occur so i would never remove diagonal bracing also if this is just going to be storage with osb floors i might remove it long enough to add flooring and then replace it rather than cutting flooring around it it is totally worth hiring an engineer for their opinion rather than fixing up a leaning roof later
DIY,not_removed,you need to talk to a qualified eng they should be able to look at the blueprints and say yes or no
DIY,not_removed,yes it was a construction brace
DIY,not_removed,yes your good
DIY,not_removed,why does everyone keep saying structural engineer i would trust a carpenters or construction supervisors opinion more so because they deal with the hands on when it comes to this kind of stuff its like hiring an electrical engineer to fix a short in your electrical outlet
DIY,not_removed,diagonal bracing is important but you could shorten it and sharpen the angle or leave it and add bookcaseshelves
DIY,not_removed,do you live in a high wind area sometimes bracing like that is used to reinforce the gable if you decide to remove it push on that gable wall after and see if it has a lot of movement if so you may want to put it back
DIY,not_removed,the are just for when they put on trusses to make them not to shift when installing the roofsheeting on top is what makes it stable and not shift left to right anymore the roof is like a lid on the house its suppose to move slightly up and down but not left and right what i would do if they are in the way of a project is remove them and reattach a board on the v section of truss on the inside so its out of the way of any work you do just attack it to back end truss to start so it keeps it secure
DIY,not_removed,if you are the least bit concerned ie the roof decking is instead of plywood etc you could get some steel strapping and nail an x to the underside of the rafters this will prevent any possibility of racking and i believe it is accepted by code in many areas and the low profile will not interfere with headroom if it is tall enough for sheet rocking
DIY,not_removed,only temporarily its function is to brace the gable end and required per most codesirc
DIY,not_removed,solid as a rock this is likely the reason
DIY,not_removed,just deck around it
DIY,not_removed,nope you need bracing could modify if needed
DIY,not_removed,it is not a support used in the construction of the roof the other trusses would have been installed after the gable truss regardless you can remove it and reinstall either plywood strips or x on the underside of the cord
DIY,not_removed,i say remove them source i want to see the resultant story photos posted later once the dust settles
DIY,not_removed,i didnt vote you up or down but i believe two reasons are behind it one it is better to air on the side of caution before anything major with minimal information and two based off other responses it seems location and eviorment are important to this question which you responded too without that information
DIY,not_removed,construction supervisor so not an engineer then
DIY,not_removed,op shouldnt be listening to internet advice he should have a professional look at it up close along with blueprints
DIY,not_removed,its a inch board its not structural
DIY,not_removed,that brace is called a kicker it supports the outside wall from and during both wind and roof construction once the roof is in place that brace is literally kicked out hence the name kick the bottom of it away from the x that is nailed to the floor one kick with a construction boot does it lift and twist to remove it from the top plate of the wall thats all it is and there is no need to see plans or blueprints ive used and removed thousands of them
DIY,not_removed,he is correct you can tell it was just some junk board that they used no one would use a for anything structural like that
DIY,not_removed,also having someone look over the blueprint and general structure of the house would be significantly safer than pulling the trigger on a dyi based on any reddit comments
DIY,not_removed,an engineer was never involved in the construction of a house it maybe had an arhitecht though doubtful any skilled carpenter or construction manager is going to be able to understand what they are looking at and make educated decisions and assertions about it
DIY,not_removed,lemme get my hands on those plans
DIY,not_removed,its a inch board its not shouldnt be structural ftfy in this case it is most likely just a kicker but you never know what someone before you did or why i would suggest checking the rest of the structure before making a decision based on one board
DIY,not_removed,it is definitely a kicker it was only held on with a couple of penny nails and was very easy to remove i cant see it supporting anything significant there is no major wind in my area and the only thing pushing on the gable does is make my arms tired because this roof is solid back to work midconstruction picture for posterity thanks for teaching us all something
DIY,not_removed,he should still get a professional to look at it i dont know why people are really promoting this kind of online advice now its not reliable a while back some dude decided to remove a load bearing wall in his living room and everybody commented about the importance of having a professional take a look before you do anything but now internet advice is fine i dont get it whatever
DIY,not_removed,i can see everything i need to know just because you are unsure based on your experience and knowledge doesnt mean that i am not capable of making a decision with the information posted
DIY,not_removed,while i agree with what others especially are saying i still recommend hiring a structural engineer to come out do an assessment and leave you with a report its useful in the event you want to sell and a buyer has the impression kickers are needed or a tornado comes through and insurance tries to claim you should have left it itll cost you a few hundred now but youre paying for the structural engineers business insurance policy which will pay out if your homeowners policy doesnt for some reason
DIY,not_removed,load bearing wall is way different from a kick board i roofed for one summer in college and even i know what that is i loved the demo side of roofing
DIY,not_removed,i have well and had a kinetico whole house sediment filter water filter and a sulfur guard system i have a sulfur gas smell the system does not need power to operate and i use very little salt in the system the sulfur guard requires a gallon of industrial grade hydrogen peroxide a month amazon subscribe and save no problems with water pressure the only down side is the sediment filter cartridge is a proprietary system and a little more expensive than a big box store i will likely put a big box store sediment filter in if i get tired of paying for the filters honestly you seem to have done a good amount of research but why not call and get a couple companies to give you a free analysis of the water and recommendations for install they will try to upsell you but then you will probably know exactly what you need to install and can diy
DIY,not_removed,a little more pricey but if you want both the hot and cold and the entire house usage to be completely filtered you may look into a home filtration system from a dealer like culligan america i had to replace a water softener in a duplex i manage and the tenants asked for water purifiers in the sink for drinking by the time i added it up i actually saved money by having a system that reverse osmosis purify and saltless softened the water they even installed it and ran an unfiltered line snub for me to connect the exterior hose bibs off of check one out saltless pure chemical free water out of a unit you never have to clean hope it helps good luck
DIY,not_removed,i installed two big box home improvement store whole house filters on my house they are both immediately after the main shutoff before any fixtures the first is a standard sediment filter the second is a standard carbon filter i havent had anywhere near the sediment in my water heater as a result and my clothing doesnt fade anywhere nearly as quickly as it once did im sure there are products i could have used that would improve things even further but the water that comes of my tap is crystal clear and no longer reeks of chlorine or whatever the city uses
DIY,not_removed,you can add this under your sink or since its city water and probably pressure in your basement pretty easy and cheap enough i think you can buy it on amazon as well then just tack a filter on your shower head not a total solution but maybe easier and cheaper total for both just something to consider
DIY,not_removed,i have well water and installed one of i have had one in my last two homes and it works well it just goes inline with your main water supply coming in from the city you can do them in a two stage system i am currently getting around
DIY,not_removed,why do you need to filter your shower water
DIY,not_removed,ro is a nono for the whole house because it produces so much waste water
DIY,not_removed,or whatever the city uses chloramine man does that stuff suck had to buy an individual filter for each faucet in the house since i rent and cannot modify the water intake system gf gets inflamed lungs from many chemical pollutants and we almost have to vacate the house for a month until it goes away
DIY,not_removed,thanks do you mind sharing what size the housing is eg the four main sizes are and and whether you have any issues with water pressure how often do you replace the filters
DIY,not_removed,im not op but my hot water has a nasty iron smell to it i am looking into a whole house filter for this reason i assume op has similar concerns
DIY,not_removed,and seems like overkill why would you want to wash your clothes in ro water
DIY,not_removed,id have to crawl under my house to do that and as im currently sick ill have to pass on that i can tell you the two filters came from home depot when i bought them years ago they only had one size i have zero issues with water pressure other than the previous cheapskate owners having used half inch copper for the entire house i change the filter cartridges once a year whether they need it or not as its just me in the house i dont even use enough water to get past the minimum usage for which my city will charge so i always end up paying for more water than i actually use looking at your size options my guess is that i have the size as i know i can fit my entire hand inside the housing i know they arent in fact i just recalled i had one of the carbon cartridges under my kitchen sink its a this may help you get an idea of whatever size housings i have lol
DIY,not_removed,yeah okay have you checked with your neighbours to see if their water smells like yours because if their water is smelly too then a filter would work but you should probably be contacting your local council or the water company and talk to them about it get the full scoop from the source theyll probably know all about it then you can make a better decision about filters if their water didnt smell then the source is likely your place and filtering is not the solution
DIY,not_removed,should have mentioned that its well water not many neighbors to ask as its a new construction home and i dont have any yet
DIY,not_removed,reminds me of hemans castle grayskull
DIY,not_removed,holy hell this is amazing
DIY,not_removed,okay so heres how we did it i dumpster dive all the materials out of construction dumpsters next we take inch cement forms and cut them in half make floors that fit the platform and round the ends so they fit into the shell we make a simple drawer and add inset steam table inserts to the drawer as litter boxes make x inch x inch towers and connect with a laminated plywood bridge thats connected with sisal rope the dias is made of small pieces of plywood that have been stapled to give the impression of stairs pillows are memory foam with red velveteen covering led lights that were made to look like little torches were added into strategic places to add effect drawbridge has wire pulleys and a hand crank added for easy access to the litter box outside is covered in large pieces of grey carpet with crown stapler then smaller bricks are added overtop any questions ill be more than happy to answer

DIY,not_removed,thanks so much we try to make the best products in the world
DIY,not_removed,sitting in a random box you need to throw away completely ignoring the wellthought out and time consuming structure you just built for them of course theyre cats
DIY,not_removed,you didnt look through the album far enough theres one of a naked cat on the wooden bridge and another picture with their little tongue out
DIY,not_removed,well you can have an upvote anyway theyre free
DIY,not_removed,ahhh old age eyes here thanks upvoted
DIY,not_removed,needs more waterfall
DIY,not_removed,it might make sense around a fireplace but it looks out of place to me to each their own
DIY,not_removed,that looks great how much was it roughly for all the materials
DIY,not_removed,looks great have you stubbed your toe on it yet
DIY,not_removed,is that airstone
DIY,not_removed,because that corner is a dead space have you thought about adding a built in bookcase or something your decorative accent looks good
DIY,not_removed,neat but why is that protrusion there
DIY,not_removed,weeks youve got some sticktoitness why do you think it took so long my wife would kill me if i had a huge pile of stones in the living room for that long
DIY,not_removed,its not to my taste but good work nonetheless it looks like you really spent the time to get it right well done on taking the time to level each layer in particular things like that are often forgotten by us newbie diyers id move the clock on the left to sit on the front of the brickwork though it would make it more of a feature

DIY,not_removed,love it how much were the costs approximately
DIY,not_removed,cool decoration bro
DIY,not_removed,fox stone
DIY,not_removed,i paid close to in materials and that includes the corners its pricey imo but i look at it as an investment for increasing home value
DIY,not_removed,thanks nope no stubbed toes but ive banged my head on it many times after frustrating hours over getting it all leveled
DIY,not_removed,yes and its a mix of their autumn mountain and spring creek colors
DIY,not_removed,a bookcase is a great idea and ive actually thought about installing floating shelves in that nook
DIY,not_removed,its a load bearing protrusion
DIY,not_removed,building reasons
DIY,not_removed,im not too sure the purpose of the wall it sits quite odd to the living room it must be a load bearing wall
DIY,not_removed,close to in materials yes you can apply to the exterior as well according to the product description
DIY,not_removed,total costs was approximately faux stones with corners tools for an oscillating tool and a dremel sawmax endless amount of liquid nail adhesive tubes i think for
DIY,not_removed,awesome
DIY,not_removed,also if you have any of that veneer left you could think about floating it out to the corner andor that wall so that it looks less like youre hiding something and more like its an actual feature in the room
DIY,not_removed,ah yeah forgot about those
DIY,not_removed,dont be a wimp op knock that sucker down and report back from the ymca you are sheltering in
DIY,not_removed,im guessing sewer pipes
DIY,not_removed,expensive but i really like it
DIY,not_removed,maybe a pipe end cap
DIY,not_removed,you really wanna go nuts maybe one of these
DIY,not_removed,blck handkerchief stuffed up into the opening
DIY,not_removed,what diameter is the hose end measure it and go to your local hardware store and get a pvc pipe cap to match

DIY,not_removed,that was my first thought but a the round opening on the front is about od which doesnt exactly match any pipe caps and b the other one is a weird shape because the hose locks into it its x
DIY,not_removed,thats a great link i might be able to find just what i need thank you
DIY,not_removed,might want to check out rskincareaddiction
DIY,not_removed,you could try melt pour soap so you dont have to handle lye just dyes if you want and scents as for fragrances that kind of varies by person i am okay with jasmine lavender eucalyptus peppermint clove and tea tree oils but you might not be and oils at full strength can be very irritating to the skin so youd still have to be cautious handling them the safest option would be to skip dyes and fragrances and use dried lavender buds rose petals and the like to add both color and scent im not sure how well that works with candles though just that its quite popular for soap
DIY,not_removed,you could go for natural beeswax or soy wax for the candles tallow for the candles or soap
DIY,not_removed,i used to make soap a little ways back there are two main ways to make soap meltandpour glycerine soaps and hotcold process where you saponify fats and oils with lye or potash i dont know if the lye would cause you any issues but its best to do it in a well ventilated area anyway i actually used to make my lye solution outside just to be safe with the proper ppe you shouldnt get any on your skin anyway you could use a respirator to protect your lungs if you wanted to be extra cautious as well otherwise you really dont need to use any harsh chemicals you could add nothing to it and just have soap with no added fragrance different oils and fats proffer different properties to a soap lye for instance makes a solid soap for liquid soaps youd use potash a mixture of the two can give you something creamier i always used essential oils but if youre especially sensitive handling them might be tough you have to be careful about getting them on your skin anyway even if you dont have sensitive skin again different oils have different properties im not going to touch on aromatherapy because i think its a bunch of mumbo jumbo but it is important to know your essential oils as some can make you more prone to skin burns citrus oils iirc or cant be used when pregnant among other things theres nothing wrong with going unscented though i cant speak to fragrance oils but theyre synthesized so you may have issues with them its fairly straightforward and you dont need a lot just the right pot and utensil a stick blender oilsfat and lye you can get fancy and add pumice clay menthol crystals and all manner of stuff but the basics are pretty easy lye does react with certain metals—i think aluminum so youd want to avoid that i keep all my soap stuff separate and out of the kitchen too in an afternoon you could easily make several pounds of soap it does need time to cure dry out but theres no harm in using it right away it will just not wash away easier in water
DIY,not_removed,soy and essential oils and listen to your body

DIY,not_removed,nice job but i just wanna hold the cat
DIY,not_removed,good job but you left out one important step need to align the grip with the head of the club there is a little notch in the grip that marks the top and before the solvent dries you need to eyeball it even with the head and i love the winn dritac grips they are great in hot weather have a great grip
DIY,not_removed,yh good job i used to do my grips when i played i used petrol gasoline instead of solvent to slide the new grips on the petrol smell goes away after a couple of rounds i used to use a couple of layers of masking tape to build up the grip for my big hands if i wasnt using jumbo grips
DIY,not_removed,have always used an air compressor for doing these although you have to be careful doing that with winn grips in my experiencedid one for a friend also only use painters tape to build it up and then skip the double sided tape so they blow off easy when its time to change again havent ever had much twisting with this method of course different grips may twist more than others
DIY,not_removed,i actually mentioned this in the description on picture

DIY,not_removed,this is awesome and sparked my interest in building a streaming machine for my living room
DIY,not_removed,this is very cool i remember being impressed by this guys specs haha here they are
DIY,not_removed,to me this is way cooler and unique than all the new high tech pcs out there
DIY,not_removed,best way to keep your pc from getting stolen in a home invasion
DIY,not_removed,nostalgia is a hell of a drug
DIY,not_removed,miter saw
DIY,not_removed,table saw with a fine tooth blade
DIY,not_removed,how big are they if they are small you could glue a piece of sandpaper to a flat surface and hand sand them with an anglecut guide block
DIY,not_removed,there are miter clippers i bought a pair for a project highly recommend them
DIY,not_removed,first you need a router table mount a router under a formica lam surface and a ° dovetail pattern router bit build a jig to run along a fence that seats the piece to be mitered make it in the shape of the negative space under a capitol m with the legs running along the fence allowing the middle valley holding your piece to be cut so the the length of the side to be chamfered is parallel to the cutting edge and the rail as it travels from top to bottom imagine an arrow pointing parrelel to the bit pay attention to the direction of rotation as you feed the material remember feeds and speeds are critical too fast creates chatter too slow and the acrylic burns if the condition of the acrylic is critical cover it in tape but no overlap do plenty of tests best of luck
DIY,not_removed,i would recommend the router method remember to feed the material carefully as acrylic chips easily a table saw blade is probably going to burn the hell out of your plastic if you have the patience then the power sander method will work as well best of luck
DIY,not_removed,thanks i found out a friend has a small mill going to try that first and if its trouble consider making a wooden jig and sanding them down
DIY,not_removed,foil can buy stuff but the stuff for cooking does pretty much the same job on the underside should help reflect some of that heat edit also a cheap fan to circulate the warmed air could help too
DIY,not_removed,whats the problem is the bar too hot or is the room too cool
DIY,not_removed,if you are simply trying to keep the table from getting too warm a decent semipermanent solution would be placing a thin compressed wood board underneath the table with an insulating foam sandwiched in between putting a foil would also help deflecting radiative heat on the other hand if you are worried about the heating efficiency because of the blocked convective air flow no worries it wouldnt at least get you a bigger heating bill

DIY,not_removed,fill it to the top of the wire before tiling use spray insulation as a barrier if theres a danger of the leveler leaking into unwanted areas use a long trowel to guide the leveler to the neededlow areas source tilesetter edit spelling
DIY,not_removed,did it rise above the top of the leveler or was there not enough leveler to cover everything
DIY,not_removed,is the same subfloor under the hardwood and the bathroom under the leveler or did you go over another flooring surface
DIY,not_removed,no pics but a flange extension is no biggy if the floor is that far out you should have checked first before anything you may end up with a difference in floor height from bath to hall if only a little mess is showing then your thinset for the tiles can make up some of it pics would help
DIY,not_removed,if i had been able to advise you before you started id have told you to use cement board on the floor and level with patch asis id say to try to scrape or grind the wire mesh so its flush or close to it then use a trowel when spreading your mortar to make sure youre able to ride any high spots message me if you need further assistance
DIY,not_removed,you can get a toilet flange that accepts toilets with flange up to below finish tile shouldnt be an issue just did same thing cover those wires or back butter tile and be careful but not advised if this is something youre not familiar with best of luck
DIY,not_removed,where are the pictures
DIY,not_removed,tile right over it
DIY,not_removed,our tub was set level which is what made us realize we had a bit more of an issue than we thought and are hesitant to add anymore self leveler because it would increase the height of our floor enough to create an issue where our toilet flange will be under the level of the finished tile height trying to avoid a flange extender and creating an even larger difference the bathroom threshold and the hallway hardwood
DIY,not_removed,everything is level now with the newly installed tub level at exterior wall to in and deep at in bathroom floor so we have about of wire exposed then of successful leveler to meet the bottom of the tub
DIY,not_removed,original wide diagonally installed subfloor is under the hall and bathroom we put plywood mesh wire self leveler in the bathroom then tile in the near future
DIY,not_removed,ill try to get pics we have already accepted a difference from bath to hall just wether we can deal with another
DIY,not_removed,our level difference was up to in places which is why we went with self leveler would you still have used the patch
DIY,not_removed,dremel is the pest performing cordless type unfortunately i have found that the cordless versions are waaaaaaaay underpowered and the charges go dead waaaaaay too quickly good luck but there really is no comparison between the corded ones and chargeable ones my cordless one gathers the dust only gets used for engraving things
DIY,not_removed,well and about this since it is after all a diy group im thinking of making my own dremel tool where the insides would basically just be a big sick performing battery beast of atleast but that i will take in another post
DIY,not_removed,ah you guys divided this up real hefty well i can see the point

DIY,not_removed,it is wall texturing if the wall didnt have texturing you would be able to see all of the defects and waves in the wall it doesnt affect painting
DIY,not_removed,where have you been living your whole life that youve never seen a textured wall before
DIY,not_removed,thats an orange peel texture you can trowel over it smooth with more sheetrock mud but id leave it

DIY,not_removed,i grew up in the midwest none of the walls were textured trends across the country seem to vary lived on the east coast and saw a lot of plaster west coast was the first time i ran into orange peel
DIY,not_removed,its not geography its age sprayed on range peel is over the last few decades before that you had other types of texture that were hand applied and before that was before gypsum board where you would have plaster plastered on the walls however it wanted to go on there either way theres not really a way to make untextured walls
DIY,not_removed,essentially double the materials but add another set of posts in the middle it will be needed
DIY,not_removed,so with a few mathematical properties we come up feet you need to add to feet to make feet

DIY,not_removed,i dont believe there is a very good answer for you situation mainly because of the lack of time in the house i would personally cover the area in plastic for the time being and revisit the idea in another year if the problem stays the way it is plastic or even just leaving it open is probably ok but i would get something that detects the humidity levels in the basement just to get a better idea of what i would need and the situation homedepot sells a mechanical thermometer and humidity gage for fairly cheep i bought one for my wifes science class i had random moisture problems and had a lot of problems telling the source after buying a dehumidifier it helped to clear things up for me mainly that the pipes had burst after the bank foreclosed on the house and the problem was never properly addressed
DIY,not_removed,i grew up in a house with a very similar basement layout to what you described in the midwest we put up heavy vapor barrier from top of the walls to and across the floor then put up bubble insulation along the walls and bought cheap linoleum remnants to put over the floor makes sliding boxes in and out much easier rope lights strung on the joints to see and its almost pleasant in there
DIY,not_removed,what are your longterm goals for the space if you dont have anything in mind i would cover the gravel with plastic to establish a vapor barrier at a minimum being that it is a basement do you have a sump pump installed anywhere you could be proactive and install a sump pump in that area if it is the lowest spot where the water built up if you are worried about it another idea is a dehumidifier to regulate the humidity in the area but that wouldnt address the water buildup since you asked about the methods obviously you know that just laying the plastic is the cheapest way to go i had to have a radon fan installed in my crawlspace so i ended up making mine a partially encapsulated crawlspace i guess what keeps mine from being fully encapsulated is that i do not have the foam board insulation on the walls and i do not have conditioned air being brought in the plastic barrier is attached to the block with a furring strip i used some of the orange fire resistant foam in a can to seal air leaks and have a dehumidifier i am in the south where they installed the crawlspace vents so i have mine sealed off with a piece of foam board wrapped in plastic and spray foamed hope this helps
DIY,not_removed,i have installed many such vapor barriers working with habitat over the years every house we built in fact was on a crawlspace the traditional method is to install thick plastic that is white on one side and black on the other its been a long week of traveling and im brainfarting on the common name at the moment will edit when it finally hits me the main issue with this method though is that when installed over peat gravel it tears eaily when walkedcrawled upon so not ideal for a storage area traditionally you would lay out the plastic and literally caulk seams so create a sealed barrier poke a hole and now that was useless as anyone who has ever installed the damn things can tell you though step on it once over gravel and you poked at least one hole thats not to say its out of the question the only real deterrent is the shredding of the plastic so lay down some osb or something over it where you plan to store and a path to it and never deviate from that path as for the exosting water pretty sure this link covers it i skimmed the article but it seemed to cover the various methods and situations httpswwwgooglecomampwwwfamilyhandymancomsmarthomeownerhowtoinstallavaporbarrierinthecrawlspaceamp edit visqueen is the barrier you can get super thick versions that may allow for some light traffic but youll want to do your research there people can visqueen an entire crawlspace in hours but its still wasted time and money when you rip it to shreds walking on it
DIY,not_removed,your average vapor barrier wont handle foot traffic for long my recommendation would to not store stuff there to begin with
DIY,not_removed,you should consider looking outside the home and redirecting the water away from the house before it ever gets inside leaky guttersground erosion at the houseetc you can put all the vapor barrier down you want but it wont stop the water from getting to the crawl space in the first place
DIY,not_removed,above is a link to a great microbial resistant sealant that works great for light moisture i have used this several times in crawl spaces and basements and have never had a complaint from a homeowner visqueen could work but if you are laying it over a known water source all you would be doing is covering it up and leaving no way for the moisture to evaporate which could cause a mildew smell or worse mold this product comes in clear or white and the clear works great if you dont want it to be noticeable but its harder to see where you have applied it
DIY,not_removed,vapor barrier under of concrete is the only surefire answer here dont use bubble insulation as some others have said here that stuff does absolutely nothing and is a complete shit material if youre storing stuff on top of the gravel youre entering a world of pain
DIY,not_removed,info dump incoming check these pictures to better understand what i am talking about httpwwwcrawlspacevaporbarriernetassetsimagesinsulationwithlinerpng httpwwwenergyefficientsolutionscomimagesfoamunventedcrawlspacevbjpg current state of my project httpimgurcomaakyrn i am currently working to encapsulate the crawl space in my house as i am tired of crawling around on gravel mice infestation and the rock dust and moisture introduced from it if you are looking for a slightly less rigorous encapsulation you could skip sealing the rim joist but it will make a big difference if it is leaking air at all also dig up the gravel around the foundation walls and check for holes that should be patched with some vinyl cement patch where rodentsinsects could be coming into the house i found holes that mice were using in my crawl space step clearvacuum the top of the foundation walls and sill plate horizontal piece of wood that rests on top of the foundation walls and on which the rimband joist and floor joists sit dig under the gravel floor to determine if old plastic is present under the gravel if there is plastic sheeting remove it if you seem to have excessive gravel in the crawl space remove gravel until the floor is about inches higher than the foundation wall footer assuming you can see it step ensure all crawlspace vents are sealed as good as possible foundation vent covers metal can be attached to the outside of the house if the vents are accessible then cut a piece of thick extruded polystyrene foam board xps to fit into the vents on the inside of the crawlspace use a can of expanding gap fill foam to coat the inside of the vents and then press the foam board into the vent to fully seal it go around the edges of the foam board to ensure a complete seal step seal the rim joist using the same method as sealing the vents cut xps board to fit into each rim joist space as seen in my imgur album as the purple foam board spray expanding foam all the way around the edges of each rim joist space and then push the foam into it finish by spraying more foam around the edges of the foam board step cut lengths of to mil clear poly to reach from the top of the foundation walls down to the floor overlapping the floor inches attach the poly sheeting to the top of the foundation walls in front of the sill plate do not attach to the sill plate but rather directly to the concreteconcrete block of the foundation walls in order to prevent water wicking up and rotting the sill plate attach the poly using butyl tape and caulking if you want to be extra safe make sure the butyl tape has no gaps and fill gaps with caulk as needed you are trying to create an air barrier now run butyl tape vertically down the walls to hold the poly tight to the walls allow the poly to loosly lay over the gravel floor about inches from the base of the walls ensure you do not tear or puncture the poly step continue applying the poly to the walls ensuring each piece overlaps the adjacent piece by about inches use butyl tape to seal the adjacent pieces together then tape the seams between each piece with air sealing tape cant think of the name of it all of a sudden do this until the entire foundation wall has been covered anywhere that you have to make a hole for things going through the wall should be taped tight to whatever is going through the wall such as piping step find a good mil poly for the floor from what i have seen reinforced and backed poly will tend to delaminate and seperate over time which could cause problems so try to find a true mil thick poly using a similar method to the walls you will be cutting the poly to cover the floor making sure each piece overlaps adjacent pieces by inches taping the seams important the extra overlapping the floor from the foundation wall poly should go under the floor poly taping the seams step once this is all done you can use butyl tape to adhear xps boards to the foundation walls over top of the wall poly but i would check to ensure the system is working properlly before covering anything up additionally you should cut the xps boards shorter than the foundation walls as a termite inspection strip this is not required by law everywhere but you will not be giving up too much insulation value by cutting the boards short step place some plywood or whatever over top of the floor poly where ever you want to store stuff to prevent tearing or puncturing it once you are satisifed that no water is making its way inside the encapsulated space you can attach the xps boards directly to the foundation walls and then attach the wall poly overtop of the boards but i personally think it is easier to do the poly first and then tape the boards overtop but either way seems to be accepted
DIY,not_removed,bumping this because i am in a similar situation
DIY,not_removed,thanks for the reply i dont know that there currently is a problem like i said i only saw the water build up once and it was after some really heavy rain the rest of the basement is dry and from what i can tell has been for a while our clue is the really old carpet in the basement with no signs of water issues ill look for a testor and see if anything comes back off as is id think id be safe putting plastic tubs back there but i want to be able to put cardboard boxes and other stuff back there as well without having to worry about anything
DIY,not_removed,wow thanks for the linoleum remnants tip i was concerned with damaging whatever we end up putting over the pea gravel and this fixes that
DIY,not_removed,thanks for the reply the long term goal is storage area for seasonal type stuff holiday decorations camping gear summerwinter clothes and other assorted stuff we do have a sump and radon fan but theyre on the opposite corner of the house even if we didnt the crawl space area isnt the lowest point the crawl space area is about feet higher than the rest of the basement
DIY,not_removed,thanks for the reply that was actually one of the sites i came across i also had concerns about damaging it while using as a storage area however another user noted they had linoleum remnants on top i think it sounds like a great idea but wouldnt mind others thoughts on it
DIY,not_removed,i also had concerns about damaging it while using as a storage area however another user noted they had linoleum remnants on top i think it sounds like a great idea but wouldnt mind others thoughts on it right now the barrier is more to protect the stuff im storing rather than a moisture issue fix but i dont know if im just under estimating the need for a vapor barrier
DIY,not_removed,that would work too ive typically seen osb as its cheap and durable but no reason lonoleum wouldnt work either
DIY,not_removed,use water proof containers also want it to be rodent proof sportsman trunk ammo crates rubbermaid action box ziplock weathershield box
DIY,not_removed,sounds like you need a guide as far as the brittle part goes that likely comes down to the fact that your material is just too brittle unless your cutting process is causing fractures theres probably not much you can do for that hope this helps and doesnt ruin a dream if you put enough time and research in you might find something that can solve all of your issues
DIY,not_removed,do you use a diamond bit does dremel make one sounds sweet
DIY,not_removed,do you get them from dremel or are they made second hand
DIY,not_removed,cool thanks

DIY,not_removed,i honestly havent be able to find much about this i feel like maybe im doing something that isnt really done is there a way to strengthen a brittle material like stone
DIY,not_removed,i have so many different diamond bits the disk shaped one is my favorite
DIY,not_removed,dremel makes its own bits but you can get bits from online or just at local walmarts
DIY,not_removed,ive seen building restorations that stabilize crumbling brick with some type of glue maybe its called a binder that soaks into the brick might work on stone
DIY,not_removed,ive used lacquer thinner and a good supply of rags for numerous projects like this
DIY,not_removed,if its years old chance are pretty good that the finish is shellac dont think varnish and polyurtheane were real popular back then they used powdered lac bug shells dissolved in alcohol its dirty shellac try a combination of three parts denatured alcohol and one part lacquer thinner sponge it on with a scotch brite and scrub it down the schellac will begin to dissolve wipe off the residue and repeat until you get it clean and smooth refinish with shellac
DIY,not_removed,could be sap but likely the wood isnt a resinous tree like pine shellac is the only thing out there thatll seal in sap anyway user jatnep posted the best solution imo
DIY,not_removed,that looks like sap leaking out due to heat as noted by others it can be removed with thinner and vigorous rubbing with non linting cloth
DIY,not_removed,i would try just alcohol first use gloves its safer
DIY,not_removed,thank you for the suggestion whats the outcome of using lacquer thinner does it remove the finish if so does it remove the finish completely enough to apply a new finish or does it just spread it thinner if thinner would i have to recoat with more lacquer thank you
DIY,not_removed,it should remove that finish down to the bare wood then you can recoat with lacquer or poly
DIY,not_removed,johnson hardware
DIY,not_removed,would an accordionstyle sliding door work for your application theyre typically much thinner than bifold doors
DIY,not_removed,you would need to remove the track then install swing clear hinges on the doors then devise a way to keep the doors closed without the track probably with magnetic catches
DIY,not_removed,nice thing is johnson will sell to anyone so anywhere you go can order loweshd will get the best multiplier from johnson and will usually negotiate a lower margin on their side takes a couple of weeks
DIY,not_removed,just your friendly neighborhood millwork sales guy
DIY,not_removed,how many redditors will it take to change this bulb there should be a c clip holding the glass in you squeeze it together and remove the clip then the glass the bulb has pins that slide into a socket on the wire
DIY,not_removed,these typically have a base httpwwwtopbulbcomlightbulbbases they can be hard to turn because there is a sort of bump to lock them into place but they can be turned sometimes it helps to get a suction cup to attach to the bulb and get you some leverage
DIY,not_removed,why not pull the entire fixture down so you can get a good look at it
DIY,not_removed,thank you will try this tonight
DIY,not_removed,this
DIY,not_removed,thank you very helpful wish me luck
DIY,not_removed,well if you dont want to buy a hole saw you sure arent going to want to buy a rotary broach personally id plasmacut the rough outline and finish it with a dremel if i for some reason didnt want to break out the hole saw kit but to be honest your best bet is going to be with a hole saw
DIY,not_removed,best way knockout punch cheapest saber saw with a metal file to clean it up compromise hole saw
DIY,not_removed,i did something similar with a jigsaw just make sure you brace the inside of the can with a block of wood and go slow
DIY,not_removed,jigsaw

DIY,not_removed,but to be honest your best bet is going to be with a hole saw pretty much what i figured
DIY,not_removed,ehh i dont have a jigsaw and dont really trust myself to cut it correctly
DIY,not_removed,no offense but using a jigsaw seems janky as fuck to me plus id have to buy one so the holesaw would be cheaper since i already have the drill
DIY,not_removed,the hole doesnt have to be super accurate the speaker should cover the edge but if you dont have one that doesnt help
DIY,not_removed,the hole doesnt have to be super accurate the speaker should cover the edge yeah but id know that it looks like shit im sure i could borrow one but id be much more comfortable with the holesaw tbh although im going to have to cut a rectangle eventually to fit a car radio so maybe i should look into it
DIY,not_removed,short version is youll never seal it from the bottom you have to keep the water from getting through from the start which is on top
DIY,not_removed,try filling holes with henry rubberized wet patch and if that doesnt work then good luck tearing up the deck
DIY,not_removed,nothing short of fixing the water at the source ie up top will stop water from coming in for a temporary measure you could always control the water coming in by mounting a rain gutter system below the holes to channel the water elsewhere
DIY,not_removed,can you give us pictures of the deck it would really help us to work through possible solutions
DIY,not_removed,im not sure how the deck is built but can you make it water tight to prevent water from getting to the bolts
DIY,not_removed,i agree
DIY,not_removed,thats what i was afraid of i know its an unrealistic goal but i hoped there that someone perhaps had encountered a similar issue and found a solution for it thank you for your input
DIY,not_removed,i was afraid there werent any easy solutions to this issue but i wanted to give rdiy a shot since someone might have encountered similar issues in the past ive been contemplating the gutter you mentioned in the past but itll be halfassed at best and youll still have a lot of water in the garage i appreciate the input though thanks
DIY,not_removed,i unfortunately dont have any pictures available at the moment but its fairly standard balcony the deck consists of i know these terms arent right laminated plywood sheets covering the horizontal supports about of the balcony hang over the garage roof edge and the rest of it is fixed to the roof i was considering removing the wood covering the gaps between the horizontal supports what do you call those and crawling underneath but i dont think itll be a viable solution due to the cramped space
DIY,not_removed,unfortunately not it would cause water pooling on the deck ill just have to tear it up
DIY,not_removed,i also agree and your english is very good btw
DIY,not_removed,thank you that actually means a lot
DIY,not_removed,the faucet broke off my shower the interior pipe is plastic and sealed in somehow i cant remove it
DIY,not_removed,your submission has been removed all questions asking for help must go in a text post or if appropriate in the stickied thread at the top of rdiy see the httpswwwredditcomrdiywikiguidelines for more information if you believe this is a mistake please thank you
DIY,not_removed,go to the wall behind the shower and there should be an access panel that will allow you access to the plumbing the faucet is most likely attached to your hot and cold water knobs so the whole piece will have to be replaced
DIY,not_removed,awesome man
DIY,not_removed,i love it
DIY,not_removed,coulda used some duct tape lol very nice
DIY,not_removed,if ya have a printer i designed a dock that can be modded to set up like that and uses the puck type chargers too bad the phones now days are moving away from wireless charging

DIY,not_removed,i think if i could afford a printer i might just buy a premade charging dock but honestly it was fun making this little gadget and having a printer to make certain parts would be super cool maybe one day
DIY,not_removed,it is a satcahi one i got off amazon it has a port usb hub on it which is pretty nice since my pc is wall mounted
DIY,not_removed,had to offer and with the prices of printers now days its something you might look at the buck monoprice printer is a deal that is hard to pass up
DIY,not_removed,i honestly didnt know there were any under i may have a new purchase to make on black friday
DIY,not_removed,yea tbh there are several decent printers under the folgertech has been my go to on suggested printers there is a discount code in the facebook group but for a prebuilt printer the monoprice printer is pretty good
DIY,not_removed,put some sort of heavy metal pyramid over the top of it that way if anyone falls onto it they roll off and no one can fall into the pit if youve not had an alcohol incident yet you will in the next years its just a thing that happens and unlike campus you cant cover it up and they will try to throw you under the buss
DIY,not_removed,dear fraternity bothers any bets yet on who will be the first to fall in
DIY,not_removed,seriously no fraternities in the uk though thats surprising i thought youd be all over the secret society idea fun story i went to greece over the summer and met some swedes who found out i was in a fraternity they immediately challenged me to red solo beer pong its good to know some stereotypes are multicultural
DIY,not_removed,uk question whats a fraternity i mean you see references to it in coming of age movies like american pie and occasionally when one of them goes turbo and smashes up a hotel but what are they actually for we dont have such a concept in the uk uni system
DIY,not_removed,nicely done boys do as skellum says get a grate at least to cover that thing
DIY,not_removed,nice job on this really youd ideally want a vent tunnel coming off it to the surface for air circulation but thats not really practical in a yard situation
DIY,not_removed,looks nice i recommend the sides get built up at least inches to avoid someone stepping into this by accident
DIY,not_removed,not a single piece of rebar
DIY,not_removed,thank you truth be told i dont think im a big deal either they must have got me confused with somebody else
DIY,not_removed,hope you guys didnt kill a tree
DIY,not_removed,how many people can you fit in that hot tub
DIY,not_removed,youre going to end up really fucking hating chosing bricks

DIY,not_removed,looks nice i recommend the sides get built up at least inches to avoid someone stepping into this by accident
DIY,not_removed,i appreciate the thought and i dont know if you missed it by accident but i did say in the first image that we have constructed a sturdy cover tested fully for exactly those reasons
DIY,not_removed,i can tell you it was the brother in the middle of the picture hahaha
DIY,not_removed,i didnt realize you were a big deal on this sub congratulations on your award
DIY,not_removed,the simplest answer is they are philanthropic organizations at colleges university a sorority would be the female equivalent they began forming around the mid to late as debate or academic clubs and were very selective only white catholic men since then there are a number of fraternities even specific ones for minority groups religions and even focused academic fraternities engineering or architecture for example nongreek people not in fraternities or sororities people only see them for the parties or in movies like american pie or animal house but being in a fraternity goes beyond the partying its a collection of men dedicated to a cause or core set of beliefs that they then stand for and defend for life example my fraternity is pi lambda phi we stand for equality for all people and because of that we are more accepting of minorities and other religions within our brothers my chapter was the first to integrate at our university this was because our founders were secluded from joining a fraternity based on their religion back in every fraternity has a set of core beliefs like that fraternities can be great social opportunities and connections last for the rest of your life you might wonder why universities allow them to exist considering how much trouble they tend to cause beyond the partying they are philanthropic organizations and philanthropy events are held throughout the year to raise money for the cause of their choice some fraternities have national philanthropies all chapters donate to some donate to local organizations in the town the chapters are in when i say chapter a chapter is an individual fraternity at a school there can be multiple fraternities at one school and there can be multiple chapters under one name at different schools so if i visit a school that has my same fraternity those are also my brothers and would treat me as such some fraternities are national some like mine are international meaning we have chapters outside the united states all fraternities have an hq they report to tldr fraternities party but also give back to their communities they originated as philanthropic and academic organizations and their primary purpose is to benefit their universities and communities and create brotherhood bonds that last for life
DIY,not_removed,someone mentioned this on the imgur post would it be as simple as running a pipe from the bottom of the pit to the top
DIY,not_removed,initially we set out to build an above ground fire ring pit but due to building code restrictions couldnt build above the ground we have a cover for it for when its not in use but will consider looking into getting a grate
DIY,not_removed,youre talking about rebar running inside the cinderblocks no we opted against it since its only blocks high and didnt know if it was worth the trouble
DIY,not_removed,oh wait i was looking at the home improvement sub thats where you got the award
DIY,not_removed,the tree is massive and the root we removed is so small and close to the surface its definitely not a major root just a nuisance
DIY,not_removed,we talking stacked standing up or sitting down here
DIY,not_removed,would you elaborate
DIY,not_removed,any particular reason bricks are used all the time for fireplaces we assumed it was typical
DIY,not_removed,pretty sure he means for when its lit you need a sturdy metal pyramid or dome over the pit
DIY,not_removed,id push him in
DIY,not_removed,i would suggest that you brick out a tunnel about bricks wide but about one brick off the bottom of the pit so you dont push ash and detritus into it brick it away from the pit to a place that you can bring it up to the surface and put a nice lid on it get a log grate see below will help a lot as well when in use just open the lid when not in use keep is closed so crap does not get in your vent tunnel added bonus if you have trouble lighting your fire or getting it going a leaf blower at the end of the vent is a hell of a help to getting that fire ripping hot quick simple version of this
DIY,not_removed,which only proves that you are a man of many talents
DIY,not_removed,not saying youre wrong but some trees fall the surface of the earth rather than go deep down
DIY,not_removed,i believe that the bricks used in fireplaces are typically firebrick a type that can withstand high heat for prolonged periods your brickmortar may deteriorate over time
DIY,not_removed,i was thinking a flume would be interesting just for smoke reasons but the reason its an in ground pit and not above ground is because of the building requirements for our area we cant build above something like two feet above the ground so we had to go below but i appreciate your concern
DIY,not_removed,a leaf blower holy shit thatd start a fucking fire i do some aluminum casting into a quart bucket sized furnace i use an old hair dryer and that thing gets hot leaf blower probably gets you a massive fire in under a minute
DIY,not_removed,not may will deteriorate im surprised nobody told you guys about refractory mortar or firebricks refractory is made for extremely high heat and firebrick will not explode under high heat conditions im really not trying to shit on your parade but if those arent firebrick there is a potential for the water in the brick to cause the brick to fail sometime causing an explosion
DIY,not_removed,i am not joking here i have a pound molyd glassmelting furnace and secondary glass furnacesic carbide and a three pot color wire the weight sizes are for the crucible sizeamount on the insides the larger one is about the size of of a minicooper i was there early this morning to charge it and it sits at add to that gloryholesreheating furnaces ng think your foundry on its side with swinging doors so i can reheat the work when running about couple other ancillary pieces of hot equipment like a garage and pipe warmer and you got a working glass shop oh and large annealers to cool the work slowlyalmost forgot about them oh and the lapidary wheel wet belt sander diamond water feed chopsaw sandblaster etcetci am starting to realize my hobby that turned into a business is a bit out of control
DIY,not_removed,those look like solid modular brick since this pit is below grade in my opinion op may have inadvertently made the right choice fire brick do fine above grade but in a situation where moisture is likely always present their life dramatically lowers as they are much more porous solid sand molded brick do much better in moisture rich environments they have a slightly different chemical makeup than the fire brick and are more dense
DIY,not_removed,i appreciate everyones concern were not looking to build bonfires here just small ones for heatsomething nice for evening events eventually we might have to redo the facade but thatll be a project for brothers down the road
DIY,not_removed,i find this quite pallettable
DIY,not_removed,obligatory was the pallet treated because you might get cancer if it was
DIY,not_removed,this post got gold
DIY,not_removed,next time miter the corners and itll look way more finished often its the little details that make a huge difference also you might want to think about swapping out the legs with especially if you ever want to put your feet up on the thing
DIY,not_removed,great build i love the look and the repurposing of what many consider trash keep doing this and posting inspire others to diy
DIY,not_removed,nice table
DIY,not_removed,honestly it looks like something which people make for their garage i mean its nice and all but maybe a bit too grunge for me to put in my living room
DIY,not_removed,daaaaaaaad get off of reddit
DIY,not_removed,ya i get it i wouldnt put this in my living room either this was for my game room so i only have to please myself the only reason i wanted one was to hold my beer and spit cup while i play video games
DIY,not_removed,merica
DIY,not_removed,fuck ya
DIY,not_removed,i have almost the same setup and questions would love an answer
DIY,not_removed,i can probably answer this for you but i think it would require a phone call lol two questions what provides cooling if anything are you saying there are two transformers one at the furnace and one at the pump edit also can i confirm you have no central air conditioner or blower that circulates air i hate hvac because vernacular is so localized where i am we call what you have a hot water boiler a furnace is only if you have forced air blowing heat not water circulating
DIY,not_removed,ok so what you have is in the furnace the thermostat which is a switch was removed on the transformer the two sides of the coil were jumped together the g and rh this would pull in the coil permanently and always provide voltage to the motor i think in your case it went to two motors so to control them the pump relay was installed so when your former thermostat called for heat the switch closed and the pump started im not quite sure how it fired the boiler with the information given basically you have two transformers separately derived systems battling each other im guessing they dont share a common ground so you will want to just use the c from the pump relay what is the purpose of the we im not sure why you need it
DIY,not_removed,thanks for taking the time to help no cooling you are correct it is a hot water boiler hydronic heat we have zones only am converting one thermostat to the wifi thermostat the zone temperature is controlled by running the respective pump so one boiler pumps two thermostats there are transformers the first is the which runs the boilers gas valve igniter etc the other two are with the pump relays see tech manual in original post which seems to also provide a transformer i can take more pictures handdrawings if it helps
DIY,not_removed,the boiler controls its own temperature with a temperature switch this control circuitry is driven by the boiler transformer the pump relaytransformer does not provide a c connection my understanding of it is the rhw wires are supposed to be for the thermostat to cycle the pump relay c is to provide for a constant path to power the wifithermostat so it doesnt go through batteries like crazy
DIY,not_removed,do you have wires going to the boilers transformer and the pumps on this single thermostat this sounds like a transformer voltage reference issue the secondary side of a transformer floats in voltage so if you have one wire to one and another to the other transformer you wont get zero volts between the two unless you tie the low sides together also i guess we should verify these are ac not dc
DIY,not_removed,it may not provide a c connection but its there though it may not be connected to ground that might be your problem you have it tied to the c on the other furnace transformer c ill have to draw this all out when i get to work tomorrow its hard for me to picture all this in my head
DIY,not_removed,yes all voltages are ac so i tried wirings today the first i think is what i want but like you implied is raising voltage up to because of the floating voltage wiring setup common from the pin on the boiler transformer and left terminal of pump relay transformer rh from pin on boiler transformer white from pump relay right terminal this yielded voltages as described in the first picture rhw rhc wc wiring attempted i went back and connected rh red to the right terminal of the pump relay white to the left termina of the pump relayl and kept c to the terminal shown in the pictures of the furnace transformer this gave me confusing results taking voltages at the two terminals on the pump relay gave me the expected however each terminal to ground gave me additionally at the thermostat i had the following readings rh w rh c w c i expected rh c to be the thermostat runs in this mode but purely off the batteries just now when relooking at the setup and the spec sheet for the it mentions a jumper from terminals that can be removed this jumper is installed in my setup if removed it appears like this would disable the transformer at the pump relay which should make the first wiring setup work no
DIY,not_removed,looking at the wiring diagrams in more detail give me a minute sounds like your pump transformer isnt ground on the secondary side so its floating thats how you get both sides to read zero volts to ground
DIY,not_removed,the jumper is removed if you provide a separate circuit to power the relay and to power the load off the relay
DIY,not_removed,so here is the issue in order to do a like for like swap you need a common from the thermostat to the transformer which the pump relay doesnt provide a terminal for it would look like this obviously you have no way to wire that with the terminals provided unless you feel like splicing in a wire unfortunately there is an elephant in the room here i dont think the system should have been operating the way it was previously as i have inferred at least you should never keep a boiler firing without circulation you always run a risk of blowing your pipes apart that way i would really like to know what control board is operating the boiler my guess is that it has a high limit safety device that is shutting off the burner but that is not a foolproof system imo this gets complicated from a wiringexecution standpoint but the way this should really work is as follows a thermostat determines that a zone needs heat and sends a signal before a boiler fires the associated pump for the zone calling for heat should come on then the boiler fires once the zone is satisfied the thermostat stops the call for heat the boiler stops firing the circulation pump stays on for a period of time minutes and then shuts off also either thermostat needs to be able to command the boiler on and off the means and methods of accomplishing this type of control are varied and really depends on the controllers you have installed fyi i currently design and test commercial hvac system for hospitals and university and used to install the control systems so i am giving you the absolute best practices advice above i would not expect home hvac techs to understand that it should be done this way yet alone know how to wire it if you really want to get into correcting this pm me and i can try to help you out most contractors are not used to multi zone multi pump systems
DIY,not_removed,i appreciate the help
DIY,not_removed,thank you again for taking the time to help me sort this out i added two pictures to the album above with a shot of the boiler control board and a thermal switch hilimit control switch on drawing the system was installed with the house in which might explain the contrarian design maybe not i definitely understand your concern with the static fire design if it makes you feel any better there is a pressure relief on the boiler heat exchanger itself if youd indulge me another thought ive added one last drawing to the imgur album if i could disable the pumptransformer is that possible can you explain if the proposed wiring in my sketch would work
DIY,not_removed,alright i popped the circuit board out of the casing this morning and it was actually very simple to jumper on a c wire thanks old school construction no integrated circuits all wiring posts just turned everything back on and the voltages all make sense unit is working wifi is working well see if it becomes intermittent again i was thinking about what you said about firing the boiler by itself currently there is a wire that passes through the thermoswitch on the boiler which then goes to the control board i would imagine this is a shut when i need to call for heat if so i think i could jumper in the auxcontacts on the pumprelay to require the thermostat to be calling for heat as well in order for the boiler to fire
DIY,not_removed,awesome glad that worked it should hold up imgur is either down or my phone cannot connect to it ill look at the sketch tonight and let you know in general the problem is that you need either thermostat to be able to call the boiler on that isnt hard but you will need to use a common transformer for all relays which is problematic since the pump relay had a integral transformer back to a previous question it was unclear to me if removing the jumper in the pump relay would kill the transformer if it does then you could use the boilers transformer to power both thermostats and pump relays these would both land on the boilers relay as well again ill look at what you uploaded tonight and come up with a diagram of how to turn the boiler off and on with both stats in parallel if you really wanted to get fancy you could use an off delay timer at each pump to keep the pumps running for minutes after the boiler stops firing technically they would eventually pay for themselves in energy savings each time you fire the boiler and it gets shut off without continued flow you are sending those last btus up your stack not into your house its only a little each firing cycle but it adds up quickly when you think about cycles a day each day of the heating season
DIY,not_removed,ok are you ready for this here is the wiring to correct the boiler always firing situation the best schematic to look at is the one for the boiler image in your album the is just two devices a va transformer and a no dpst relay thats it here is how it was supposed to work for a single pump singe thermostat the thermostat gets from the transformer from post r on a call for heat the thermostat closes the internal contact and passes the v to post g this goes though the coil of the relay and back to common post c with the relay energized the pump is energized from contacts and and the boiler is commanded on from contacts and i hope that makes sense if not read again until it does otherwise my sketch wont make any sense at all in order to make this work with two pumps and two thermostats we need either thermostat to be able to command on the boiler by pulling in the relay on the however when this happens we only want the one pump to run this is where it gets tricky what we have to due is add two more no dpst relays you could get the same honeywell that is listed on the schematic but there are cheaper versions just google no dpst relay make sure the coil is not so the way this works is each thermostat gets connected to the coil of a dpst relay when the thermostat call for heat one pole turns on the boiler on turn on the pump ok let me know if you have any more questions in the schematic i gave you i used colored dots to show each wire connection between the thermostats new relays pump relays and the boiler relay
DIY,not_removed,youre incredible that makes a lot of sense and is easy to follow very well put together you must do this for a living or something ill start doing some research for dpst relays for this application and add this to my list of projects around the house
DIY,not_removed,no problem im just glad to help and hopefully prevent a bad situation in the future i forgot to respond about the safety relief valve you mentioned that should in theory prevent your pipes from over pressurizing and exploding they dont always work when needed though ive heard of too many that stuck closed and the boiler blew as a result ive learned to never trust a safety

DIY,not_removed,use a locking pin with a spring engagement and solenoid disengagement should only require a couple second actuation before the motor engages to release the tray so the motor can turn it a worm gear type drive can work but worm gears can be driven backwards under the right circumstances you can play with electronically locking the motor but most methods are either power hungry and generate a lot of heat or only kind of work back emf is only so strong
DIY,not_removed,try shorting the motor leads together while turned off it will make it harder to turn even for a stepper motor it will work too
DIY,not_removed,a worm gear cant be spun by applying torque to the output but making it work could be difficult gearmotors can provide a lot of friction can you make a chute which the food falls through or make a cover which prevents kitty from forcing the mechanism
DIY,not_removed,electric car door latch
DIY,not_removed,solenoid pin sounds like a good idea i forgot you can get ones with spring engagement thanks a lot ill try that
DIY,not_removed,thats a cool and simple change thanks ill try that
DIY,not_removed,worm gear for sure that or high reduction gearing
DIY,not_removed,chutes another solution yes it requires buying it doing from scratch though i wanted to start by trying to secure the existing one the worm gear motor with friction has a safety issue unfortunately i need the rotation to fail if theres a paw trapped in the middle the current mechanism has a failsafe where the rotating head has a kind of a clutch builtin i want the rotation to be locked only when the motor is already stationary failure to rotate is absolutely desired
DIY,not_removed,worm gears have limited torque just like ordinary gears some vcrs used a worm gear for threading they would stop when touched lightly still the design and implementation is probably too difficult and costly
DIY,not_removed,i thought there might be a snap ring on the rod journal holding the connection rod on but similar schematics say no i would guess there are snap rings holding the piston pin in place see if there is a little wire in a groove in the piston holding the pin in if it is get that out push that pin toward you remove the piston and then maybe you will have more wiggle room to get the rod off the rod journal i dont know these just going off what i know about car engines
DIY,not_removed,if the connecting rod seized up and wont move on the crank there is no getting it off with out a press or a puller even then you will need a new crankconnecting rod i would just get a new compressor man
DIY,not_removed,usually the connecting rod just floats on the crankshaft relying on the piston in the bore to keep it on so i would remove the piston wrist pin circlip or wire loop pull the piston and then use a jaw puller to get the connecting rod off you might be able to lap them both smooth again but its going to be noisy unless it has replaceable bearings not often the case
DIY,not_removed,a bigger better compressor on craiglist is about so you are right but my determination to fix this will probably end up costing me more
DIY,not_removed,i get it then you need a puller
DIY,not_removed,the beams are pulled inwards by a string which is wrapped around the cylinder that the arm is attached to rotating the arm backwards pulls the strings inwards and causes beam deflection which is opposed by the wood piece that catches on the rack removing the wood piece releases the rack and the tension in the beams which spins the cylinder and the arm which is attached
DIY,not_removed,never skimp on bathroom vent fans always spend the money for a quality model that will work for the space there are cleansers to remove the mold afterwards you should prime and paint also stop take such long hot showers
DIY,not_removed,my fan wasnt strong enough for the job and wasnt being run enough i separated the switches so i could run it without having the light on installed a more powerful fan and i make sure that door is open after a shower you have to be pulling in drier air to vent the room a fan in a closed damp room isnt doing much
DIY,not_removed,the mold isnt going to go away on its own now that it has a foot hold you have to clean and kill the mold with a fungicide like concrobium otherwise it will keep growing if that gets things under control you can use an anti mold and fungle primer like zinssers also for the future make sure the ventilation van gets left on for minutes post shower to help keep moisture down
DIY,not_removed,i would start with making sure you left or if there even was venting in the soffit clear and unobstructed you did a great thing venting it outside mind if i ask how it gets outside also it is common for people to not use the fan and leave the door closed so the bathroom cant dry out you can do multiple things but lets start with this
DIY,not_removed,i think maybe your moisture is coming from above is the flashing on your new vent leaking onto the ceiling is the attic properly vented those are the first things that i would check
DIY,not_removed,kill everything that is there theres many ways to to that i wont get into it after it is clean paint with this httpswwwrustoleumcomproductcatalogconsumerbrandszinssercleanersandmoldandmildewproofpaintspermawhitemoldandmildewproofinteriorpaint zinsser permawhite is amazing i have a fairly strong fan in my bathroom and i would still get little bits of mold this paint has kept it mold free for about years now
DIY,not_removed,the insulation is keeping the sheetrock damp make sure the water is not coming from above but i bet its that you may want to run a compressorbased not peltier dehumidifier to dry it out we run our vent fans for a long time after a shower ends and the lights are out to get the humid air out try leaving the lightvent on for an hour or two after the shower is off
DIY,not_removed,i had this problem and there two issues subpar fan the corrugated hose in my eve wasnt insulated so during the winter the hot humid air would freeze in the tube eventually the tube was a frozen over and the ice would melt when i showered and water would drip back into the fan and down the ceiling etc i rolled an entire roll of insulation right over that tube
DIY,not_removed,didnt go top of the line but didnt cheap out went middle of the road should be adequate for the room size from what i read will do stop fogging up the outside of my window
DIY,not_removed,the attic seems to be vented ok still the soffit vents seem to be ok and there are end vents and a ridge vent as well for the fan i got a vent kit that has a hose i ran from the fan to the soffit and a spring loaded vent that goes to the outdoors and the bathroom door is always open all the way when its not in use
DIY,not_removed,the vent actually goes out the soffit not up through the roof attic venting appears fine made sure i didnt block the soffits has end and ridge vent too
DIY,not_removed,is the duct insulated you could be condensation build up or theres a leak in the duct somewhere it could also be coming up through the light portion there was a really good this old house video covering all the frequent problems and how to fix them when putting in a new unit
DIY,not_removed,first kill the mold with some thing like shockwave available at jondon let walls dry completely repaint with zinsser bathroom paint or similar most importantly replace the standard fan wall switch with a timer you can go digital or analog twist style after showerset the fan to run for at least a half hour after youre done showering this should solve your problem the timer and letting the fan run long enough is the key
DIY,not_removed,venting out the soffit might be the exact cause of the issue i was just looking at bath fan installation videos because i need to place one in my fixerupper this video might be informative for you httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvpqrzwdcqie
DIY,not_removed,ill definitely check the video out but as of right now not sure why there would be a difference its still being forced directly to the outside by the fan
DIY,not_removed,the moist air is coming out the vent and going directly back into the attic via the soffit thats why they dont advise venting out the soffit it needs to go out through the roof

DIY,not_removed,i made one of these years ago led brightness is your primary variable followed by the transmittance as you guessed one piece of advice you want the side walls to be matte light absorbing any light reflection off the sides from glossy finishes will show up in the illusion
DIY,not_removed,how well mirrored the surfaces is would be the biggest factor id assume and led brightness is also likely big another large factor id guess is the thickness of the space between the two mirrors if youve got a larger distance between the two mirrors the depth should appear deeper as the light covers more distance between each bounce
DIY,not_removed,it may not be obvious but shallow depth image is actually a very large box probably on a side and large depth image is a very small box only a few inches across lit with leds so your comparison images really arent apples to apples
DIY,not_removed,i used to have one of those i would think yes it has to do with brightness of the leds possibly the mounting distance between the leds and the two mirrors could have some effect on this too as in closer might reflect better i dunno about this kind of optical science stuff sorry
DIY,not_removed,any one thats rated for natral gas and fits the pipe for the most part
DIY,not_removed,does it matter if the output is or my old cooktop is and im pretty sure the new one is can i use the pressure regulator for the old cooktop
DIY,not_removed,you should be able too worst comes worst you get a little too much gas flow or too little
DIY,not_removed,best way is to put a ledger board attached to the studs you can make it decorative and then attach the pot rack to the board that way the pot rack is attached to the studs only one level removed snap toggles would workuntil probably sometime in the middle of the night when youre all peacefully asleep so that you wake up to the sound of your dozen pots all crashing to the floor iow i dont really recommend toggles for something as heavy as a pot rack
DIY,not_removed,i agree with the other commenter that a backing board would be ideal otherwise they make these plastic anchors that i like you just need to make sure theyre secured into the drywall properly and they hold like a champ
DIY,not_removed,backboards are great if you do have to use a toggle only end of the board has a stud in reach for instance i really prefer they install easily and allow you to remove the screw without dropping the toggle inside the wall they are as strong as the drywall itself
DIY,not_removed,ive done a pot rack with toggle bolts it was fine it was a or so single tier rack i wouldnt put cast iron on it
DIY,not_removed,this
DIY,not_removed,they have the right idea for a pot rack i would not even consider toggle bolts
DIY,not_removed,those drywall anchors are great but they work best in a shear load im not sure how well theyd hold up when tensioned out
DIY,not_removed,ive also hung a pot rack with toggle bolts the type with the plastic zip strip that breaks off after you push it down flush to the wall used of them iirc as it was years ago and it is still on the sheetrock wall
DIY,not_removed,ive seen them holding a rack before but yeah theyre designed more for things that hang flat against the wall figured id mention it though
DIY,not_removed,this i use toggler snaptoggles all the time to hang heavy crap in drywall at work to my knowledge nothing has ever fallen iirc the ones are rated to in drywall or in hollow cinder block edit words

DIY,not_removed,as someone that worked at a moving company i would ask that you please keep in mind that sometime in the future some other human being will need to take this thing apart thats a big fat no on the impact wrench if its a formula one race car bed and you are racing other car beds then its allowed
DIY,not_removed,an impact wrench is a no get some nice sockets with the associated ratchets for nutsbolts and they will torque the bolts up more than enough if you want them even tighter get a breaker bar but i doubt a bed will require a breaker bar for assembly
DIY,not_removed,impact driver vs impact wrench arent they the same thing personally id use a drill and if that doesnt work id use a socket wrench i went to school for motorcycle mechanics and it was pounded into my head that an impact is for removal not assembly so id carry that in to other uses as well
DIY,not_removed,lately im finding that for thing like this im turning to my ratcheting boxend wrenches more than anything else theyre less fiddly than a socket set theres no need to keep switching sockets between socket wrenches
DIY,not_removed,bolts for a bed dont even need to be twogruntsandafart tight like wheel nuts even if it has metal to metal fittings you dont need anything like that tight if its coarse threads into wood then you need to feel as soon as it bites and stop there on the other hand the general principle of always using any job to justify a new tool is something i can get right behind
DIY,not_removed,an has a hex chuck that accepts screwdriver bits the same as those multihead screwdrivers
DIY,not_removed,thank you sincerely this is all learning for me really
DIY,not_removed,shes at the very least pretty nutty
DIY,not_removed,on the other hand the general principle of always using any job to justify a new tool is something i can get right behind ive always been taught that this is the mark of a good project whether or not it caused me to buy a new tool
DIY,not_removed,you can buy socket adapters for the hex head drivers
DIY,not_removed,oh ok thanks
DIY,not_removed,a fellow tool collector who ends up doing jobs to hide it welcome friend
DIY,not_removed,impact drivers offer waay less torque than an impact wrench though hence why theyre less than half the price an adapter would probably work for zipping up bolts on something light duty but would be useless for working on something like a car
DIY,not_removed,secondary goal which i just recently reached get enough tools in the garage that your wife doesnt even notice when you bring a new one in i brought home a floorstanding drill press and set it up right next to where she parks and it meant nothing to her
DIY,not_removed,top tip make sure all your tools are the same few colours easier to hide the new ones
DIY,not_removed,garbage disposals tend to trip gfcis when turned on so you might want to think twice about going with that solution as far as grounding the outlet simply running a wire to a cold water pipe may not provide an adequate ground and is not a recommended solution
DIY,not_removed,put in a proper ground its a wire a copper post and a clamp most kitchens have a window to the outside over the sink or nearby using a hammer drill and long bit and sealing with some silicone its not huge work bringing the ground in under the sink check your air conditioner or water heater can you fish a good ground from there
DIY,not_removed,is the circuit already gfci protected it just takes one gfci outlet upstream to protect the whole circuit and that may also be a gfci circuit breaker if its already protected that switch wont buy you added protection if its not then the switch is a good idea you just need to make sure that the junction box is wired such that you can add an outlet to it most are but not all also yes you can ground it by connecting the ground wire to the water inlet if you can attach it to copper
DIY,not_removed,first there are millions of homes wired such that there is an outlet and a switch for the disposal next to the sink wired to the same gfci protected circuit my home is wired that way if disposals tripped the gfci no one would wire it that way second hes not grounding an outlet hes grounding the disposal which has no ground wire leading to it if he can determine that the water main leads to ground as it does in most buildings unless someone has done something like install a water filter without a ground jumper there is no issue at all with grounding the appliance to a copper water pipe its done all the time
DIY,not_removed,second hes not grounding an outlet hes grounding the disposal uh ok try telling the electrons that if he can determine that the water main leads to ground as it does in most buildings unless someone has done something like install a water filter without a ground jumper there is no issue at all with grounding the appliance to a copper water pipe its done all the time that determination cannot be made reliably by a visual inspection establishing a floating ground in this manner is not safe or code compliant you really shouldnt be giving such unsafe advice here or anywhere else
DIY,not_removed,not true he is grounding the disposal that has a motor that has a ground attached to the disposal casing and no grounding to a pipe isnt legal if it was grounding the electrical system to the pipes would be allowed nec calls for a separate grounding rod for the electrical system
DIY,not_removed,uh ok try telling the electrons that doesnt respond to my comments that determination cannot be made reliably by a visual inspection i didnt say visual inspection did i i said determine
DIY,not_removed,heres your response it doesnt matter if the op runs a cable from the garbage disposal or the outlet in question to a questionable ground like a cold water pipe the appliance and outlet are electrically connected not isolated from each other as your comment implies hes not grounding an outlet hes grounding the disposal fair enough but you neglected to explain how op should go about making this determination that omission is important and potentially deadly edit replaced misstyped word in italic
DIY,not_removed,it doesnt matter if the op runs a cable from the garbage disposal or the outlet in question to a questionable ground like a cold water pipe the appliance and disposal are electrically connected not isolated from each other as your comment implies hes not grounding an outlet hes grounding the disposal that doesnt even make sense
DIY,not_removed,that doesnt even make sense doesnt respond to my comments
DIY,not_removed,i cant respond to nonsense
DIY,not_removed,that is certainly the easy way out when you are backed into a corner edit i did notice that i mistyped the appliance and disposal are electrically connected when i meant the appliance and outlet are electrically connected does that help
DIY,not_removed,traditional penetrating stain requires you to strip and sand the surfac to remove all the previous top coat and stain if you are going darker you can use a gel stain first clean the surface with ammonia and water with a little dish soap let it dry next scuff the surface with a grit sandpaper wipe off any dust and use gel stain dont forget to top coat you could also go the easy and cheap wax route briwax looks awesome when finished and goes on easy and dries hard and quick
DIY,not_removed,strip it sand it paint it

DIY,not_removed,this is just the first time ive seen a dresser like this it looks almost painted and not stained thats why i was asking thank you
DIY,not_removed,would i still need to strip everything off what kind of paint do i use
DIY,not_removed,thank you
DIY,not_removed,table saw extension i need help
DIY,not_removed,the router itself it is a regular handheld router just mounted upsidedown or something else
DIY,not_removed,nice build looks solid
DIY,not_removed,great space saving idea i think i have my next project no signs of sagging after you cut that slot i had to pitch my old router table because it slowly sagged over time with my heavy router it was a thinner metal though
DIY,not_removed,looks awesome and is a great space saving addition to a shop oddly enough last week picked up my grandpas rockwell table saw from my uncle sight unseen he built something similar with a custom fence not pictured like yours great job
DIY,not_removed,i have the same table saw and also built a router table for it i just leave a fixed base attached to the plywood so i can just drop the router in without screwing around with screws as a side note the fence on that table saw is massive pain ive never been able to get the measurement to line up right so i have to use a tape for every cut i have to use a speed square every time i lock it to get it square to the blade which is pain because i have to remeasure and adjust after i lock the back and its not vertically perpendicular to the table so ripping a board on end is near impossible i keep saying im going to figure out a way to replace it or fix it but i just get frustrated and move on
DIY,not_removed,good work and nice idea i have almost the same model table saw and limited space on my garage so i really appreciate spacesaving tips definitely going to build similar one some day any detailed pics on the fence construction
DIY,not_removed,yup plain ole harbour freight router ive got a foot controller also from hf that controls the power no more reaching under the table to turn it on and off
DIY,not_removed,i was worried about that but it seems to be rock solid no wiggle sag or bend thus far
DIY,not_removed,your grandad did one hell of a job way out of my league lol thanks
DIY,not_removed,duuuuuuude the fenceim with you i thought i could live with it but it is now driving me insane if you come up with a good replacement or fix please let me know
DIY,not_removed,thanks small build album for the fence
DIY,not_removed,thanks been looking at building my own workshop in the basement and got the router but for the things i want to make a router table seems the better option guess i will have to look into making one myself for my green bosch thingermabob
DIY,not_removed,good to hear thanks i have some scrap ply laying around that will work great
DIY,not_removed,yeah its really unfortunate there isnt an inexpensive after market fence out there to get a good fence and modify the saw for it to fit you might as well just buy a new saw next time i dont have a weekend project lined up im going to try my hand at building one from scratch ill make sure to document my work and if its a success ill post it
DIY,not_removed,thanks ive only built a simple sled for the table saw itself the angle guide which came with the saw is almost useless as it is so sloppy i really like these table saw hacks
DIY,not_removed,its been reliable as hell for me i recommend it
DIY,not_removed,totally agreed maybe a good need to fill if you build one and i hope you do please let me know we can crowd source this build and defeat the wobbly beast
DIY,not_removed,anytime i just built a sled but honestly its terrible work lol the miter gauge on this one is nothing to write home about either maybe thats my next upgrade
DIY,not_removed,what kind of wood did you use for the fence
DIY,not_removed,particle board from an ikea night stand i tore down
DIY,not_removed,i should make one of these but facing inward for all the outside cats that think they want to be inside
DIY,not_removed,
DIY,not_removed,cute my moms cat took it upon himself to make his ownby scratching a hole in the bathroom window screen large enough for his head to fit through she found out when she went to the bathroom and was greeted with kitty butt
DIY,not_removed,my boyfriend and i made one too the chains were to hold it in place while we were screwing it into the house yours looks great httpimgurcomodajwxj extra photos of him httpimgurcomdxjozib httpimgurcomhcvzpaf
DIY,not_removed,bugs
DIY,not_removed,that diagonal crossbrace only works for push strength ie when holding up a shelf it is loose fitting from what i can see so if your cat is heavy itll just drop out and provide no support at all source had a few of them hold up a desk the ones that werent perfectly aligned with the rest had the diagonal supports just drop out
DIY,not_removed,and in the winter you can use it as a fridge
DIY,not_removed,im glad you used low voltage staples or that would have been shocking
DIY,not_removed,its weird how patio doesnt rhyme with ratio
DIY,not_removed,get on my level bro
DIY,not_removed,itt people whove never heard of indoor cats
DIY,not_removed,such a great idea bravo
DIY,not_removed,but what keeps the heat from going out or the rain from coming in
DIY,not_removed,haha first thing i thought of was that
DIY,not_removed,thought it was a colorful lizard in the first picture
DIY,not_removed,nice idea i dont know much about cats but they seem to like surveying the surrounding area from somewhere high up perhaps a little bit of overengineering on the brackets though they look just like ones i used for heavyduty shelving that a rated to hold each they could safely hold your cat if she was made out of lead
DIY,not_removed,why would staples be describes as low voltage
DIY,not_removed,this is great for people with apartments if i had a cat i would consider making this
DIY,not_removed,aint nothing sadder than an outdoor cat that thinks hes an indoor cat
DIY,not_removed,itt people dont give a fuck about native populations of wildlife kudos op i really dig it
DIY,not_removed,its a drivethru window for fleas
DIY,not_removed,didnt they also used to have these for babies
DIY,not_removed,that is one lucky little munchkin you have there
DIY,not_removed,i saw someone with a massive one of these in london so good for flats though i think yours needs to be a tiiiiny bit bigger seems more like a vets transport cage than an escape
DIY,not_removed,is this easily removable im a renter but i want to make something like this for my cat that wont lose me my security deposit
DIY,not_removed,damn it costs bucks for a pet door im surprised you didnt build that part yourself as well cool project though
DIY,not_removed,lets hope thats more stable than ac units
DIY,not_removed,how did you know if your car would go through the door without that youd let so much ac out
DIY,not_removed,change the wire clips for something stronger the plastic will get brittle being outside or the cat will eat one when they start falling off
DIY,not_removed,so whats the bug situation like where you live
DIY,not_removed,fantastic job very detailed write up as well will use as inspiration for mine
DIY,not_removed,reminds me of the window cribs they had in the early but i guess if if it falls cats are better at landing on their feet than babies
DIY,not_removed,your cat has a case of hands it may be terminal
DIY,not_removed,my cat is blind and was hit by a car before we got him so he has to stay indoors at all times he would love something like this
DIY,not_removed,i kept trying to read this as cat ratiocaysheeohcasheeohcuhsheoh when its actually cat patio
DIY,not_removed,oh that lucky cat
DIY,not_removed,
DIY,not_removed,this is brilliant im saving this for my stupid cat now
DIY,not_removed,well survival of the fittest i have a cat thats not even pounds and we alive in coyote territory and shes a badass and stalks rabbits all night long lol
DIY,not_removed,no one has mentioned it but is the use of those low volt staples appropriate for this application they are intended to keep low voltage cables coax phone lines up and out of the way i wouldnt put much faith in them in keeping a cat from escaping i would think a staple or a fence staple would be better for a much more reliable way to attach it
DIY,not_removed,gold coast but still its completely advisable to keep them indoors
DIY,not_removed,ive always wanted to do this but thought buys would get in never thought about a cat door
DIY,not_removed,edit i guess i should add a pic of them waiting to go outsidehttpiimgurcomgvmzaofjpg
DIY,not_removed,this is great i have been wanting to modify my moms balcony so her cat can go sit on it and this looks like its super easy to make work for that thanks
DIY,not_removed,why dont you let the cat outside
DIY,not_removed,how much total time and money were put into this i have been thinking of making one for my cats for quite a while but just havent had time recently
DIY,not_removed,now just add some voltage to it
DIY,not_removed,i would hope that doesnt fall out wouldnt want your catio to turn into a splatio
DIY,not_removed,they used to have baby cages in the
DIY,not_removed,which floor is it on my cat would love this great idea
DIY,not_removed,but rain
DIY,not_removed,sometimes after reading comments like these i think people in countries other than the us are a bit on the slow side
DIY,not_removed,i give you appaws for the word play
DIY,not_removed,isnt it a bit small is your cat just rather stationary compared to some other cats
DIY,not_removed,heres what you could have won
DIY,not_removed,joe all so your cat can watch got huh
DIY,not_removed,you made a petio
DIY,not_removed,more like a catrison harharharhar
DIY,not_removed,if a game ever gave me anxiety it was pokemon with that fucker
DIY,not_removed,man this is cool but so many bugs would get into my house
DIY,not_removed,hay i made httpsimgurcomgallerydaiku too this is pretty cool
DIY,not_removed,ive never heard of inside cats but cool patio non the less
DIY,not_removed,you card market this dude people would love it i bet a little refinement on the cage with the folded pointy bits and it could be a money maker shark tank look out
DIY,not_removed,do you ever think about just letting the cat outside
DIY,not_removed,you should probably use something waterproof for the bedding that looks like itll get soaked and mold if you have any wind with rain
DIY,not_removed,more like a patio oh wait
DIY,not_removed,where is this magical land you live in where people dont have to worry about bugs flying into their house i want to live there
DIY,not_removed,so am i the only one who thought that this was going to be a cat radio
DIY,not_removed,this reminds me of the baby cages
DIY,not_removed,update to the catio shes in there about an hour every day
DIY,not_removed,thats a great catitat
DIY,not_removed,what does this do give your cat fresh air
DIY,not_removed,finaly a cat can be outside without actualy going outside
DIY,not_removed,ill have to post some better pics now that its mostly complete but i made one off the back of my house a few months ago cats can go in and out of it to the house walkways ramps etc i have a few bird feeders along the fence for them to watch the structure itself is about x x high so they have a lot of room to wander the year old orange cat rescue was really hyper until i started to walk him i dont have time to walk him all the time so i built this so i can just open the back window of my house and let him out i was pretty surprised my year old calico started to go out there too she just likes to lay in the grasssun i let them out when i wake up in the morning while i make breakfast and get ready for the day i let them out again usually when i get home from work in the evening httpimgurcomyubncvl
DIY,not_removed,does she like it i always think of cats as so independent the cage kinda strikes me as anticat
DIY,not_removed,i really dont get it just let him outside
DIY,not_removed,why not just let your cat go outside
DIY,not_removed,why not let they cat go outside
DIY,not_removed,itt i downvote and jump all over anybody who dare speaks a positive word of outside cats
DIY,not_removed,why dont you just let the fucking cat outside
DIY,not_removed,am i missing something here cats are delicate creatures that melt if they touch the nature idk my overlords are doing fine maybe they are some supreme race of cats definitely more intelligent than those who dont know better and must take away freedom from other creatures just to answer in front no i am not one of those people i try to live in harmony with nature and respect its ways no i am not vegan or have other issues animals that i eat first live in freedom and are hunted not mass produced please be considerate before you get the urge that you must cage some animal to fulfill some holes in your life and btw if you dont craft much nice work i know how it feels good when you make something on your own instead of buying it
DIY,not_removed,living in the uk i have never seen anything like this yall keep your cats locked up inside here cats roam freely wherever they want to with few exceptions
DIY,not_removed,taking my munchkin some getting used to yeah the cat is never going to use it you went to too much trouble try getting a piece of shit cardboard box
DIY,not_removed,why not just let her go outside
DIY,not_removed,it looks like you have a nice yard why not just let the cat out i promise it wont run away if you feed it and love it anyway
DIY,not_removed,looks more like a cat prison than a catio
DIY,not_removed,looks to me like you made a way for mosquitos to get inside
DIY,not_removed,well my cat is happy to go around free
DIY,not_removed,poor cat let it outside
DIY,not_removed,i just let my cats outside
DIY,not_removed,wheres the grill
DIY,not_removed,catio shut the fuck up
DIY,not_removed,you should save the rest of the staples for christmas time you can use them to make your cat a reindeer by stapling antlers to his head
DIY,not_removed,is your munchkin an indoor cat by choice or do you not allow himher to go outside if you dont allow munchkin to go outside that is cruel punishment and forces your cat to go against hisher natural instincts edit munchkin is a girl
DIY,not_removed,burglars love him use this one simple trick to make your house open season for all burglars
DIY,not_removed,your cat is not an outside cat you probably made your cat an indoor cat just send it outside and it will find its way
DIY,not_removed,ratio rhymes with catio
DIY,not_removed,just open the door mate stop hording your cats indoors
DIY,not_removed,this is like sleeping in a shark cage just let your cat roam free
DIY,not_removed,this is ridiculous
DIY,not_removed,living in china i have always seen something like this yall keep your cats locked up inside here cats roam freely wherever they want to with few exceptions
DIY,not_removed,boy that must just be torture if theyre never allowed outside
DIY,not_removed,just because you used low volt staples doesnt make it any more humane
DIY,not_removed,if this is as close to going outside as she is allowed that is really sad anyone who has actually had a cat that is allowed outside will agree that they are much happier if you live in an area where it isnt possible to let your cat out then you shouldnt own one rather than forcing it to live against its nature to make you happy its casual cruelty stop being selfish you wouldnt buy a dog if you couldnt walk it dont buy a cat if you cant let it roam and hunt
DIY,not_removed,what the fuck this is the weirdest thing iv eever seen like a little battery farming cat cage you coulda make it a little bigger also if your cat is not an outdoor cat who are you to force it on them
DIY,not_removed,or burgalars from coming in
DIY,not_removed,why dont stray cats dogs come in through pet doors edit apparently stray animals just dont like my house
DIY,not_removed,actually sounds like a good idea to gain their trust
DIY,not_removed,flip it around
DIY,not_removed,catshark tank
DIY,not_removed,you can make one yourself just making a sorta leanto so the cats can cuddle up to the outside of the house for heat in the winter
DIY,not_removed,might bring some mighty fleas in with them honestly though id probably do it anyway
DIY,not_removed,i should make one of these but facing inward for all the outside cats possums raccoons and other assorted wildlife that think they want to be inside
DIY,not_removed,what the hell context please
DIY,not_removed,ha
DIY,not_removed,is this what eric clapton had
DIY,not_removed,i mean if the thing is constructed securely with double triple repetitive safety measures is it really so bad obviously the one in the picture looks flimsy and not very secure but its not
DIY,not_removed,came here to post the same pic
DIY,not_removed,came here for this thanks for not disappointing
DIY,not_removed,this is still a thing in williamsburg brooklyn among hasidics i routinely see their children at their caged windows alone looking out
DIY,not_removed,dr jan itor is that you
DIY,not_removed,in years were going to look back at cats using these and wonder who thought it was a good idea we learnt nothing from the babies
DIY,not_removed,at least theres no gorilla in the cage with him
DIY,not_removed,this baby cage thing is wrong on too many levels
DIY,not_removed,was hoping someone posted this reference
DIY,not_removed,exactly what i thought of
DIY,not_removed,i got something labeled as pet screen for my entire enclosed patio and it works like a charm my crazy little girl will actually climb up the length of the screen to get to a shelf its not damaged in the slightest i recommend it its more expensive than regular screen but it actually works comes in all different sizes as well
DIY,not_removed,i too made one but its more of a house httpimgurcomarzkrt it connects into my room by a cat flap built into the window screen
DIY,not_removed,its functional
DIY,not_removed,since you didnt actually say it was for your cat im just gonna assume it was for you
DIY,not_removed,thatlooks like some sort of torture mechanism cool work though
DIY,not_removed,id be worried about thieves im just paranoid though
DIY,not_removed,multi level nice we have new siding so i didnt want the extra bracing below like you have
DIY,not_removed,looks uh great
DIY,not_removed,not the greatest of ideas to be putting screws through your siding as water can get in that way but i guess itll probably be okay enough
DIY,not_removed,hes pretty cool do you have this in addition to a standard cat flap
DIY,not_removed,im planning on making one of these soon but doing a layer of window screen in combination with the chicken wire hopefully itll keep the mosquitoes away from my kitties
DIY,not_removed,i was just going to have an open cage until my wife reminded me of bugs oh yeah thought of the plexiglass and the door now the cat needs to figure out the door it seals pretty well so im not worried about bugs
DIY,not_removed,the flap looks like it would stop most of them but id probably cut a screen around the box
DIY,not_removed,push strength compression
DIY,not_removed,oh dear i dont see how they could though i used the same washers on the bottom with nylon nuts so they shouldnt back out the screws are and are all tight where did you see a loose fitting
DIY,not_removed,maybe ill keep it in p
DIY,not_removed,then just put a cardboard box is the catio problem solved
DIY,not_removed,nice
DIY,not_removed,patio isnt pronounced paysheeoh
DIY,not_removed,ok that is amazing baby steps
DIY,not_removed,yep in my neighbour hood i drive by deadrun over cats on a daily basis no way in hell im sending donut out into the killzone but she will get a catio soon just for some air and vitamin d
DIY,not_removed,this is literally the first time that i have ever heard of having indoor cats as cruel
DIY,not_removed,well it seems a bit cruel if come from a place thats lets cats roam free
DIY,not_removed,ive heard of them but never had one i just train them not to stray far from the house
DIY,not_removed,thank you
DIY,not_removed,i am so going to use this
DIY,not_removed,ill take it out in the fall for the winter kitty will have to deal its the beginning of summer here
DIY,not_removed,thanks they do like to be high and this is feet off the ground feet away is our bird feeder and chipmunks gather below for the scraps she is in heaven i agree the brackets are a bit much but they came with the shelf that used to hold about pounds im sure they could hold much more like you said
DIY,not_removed,for voice or data network cabling
DIY,not_removed,its used for stabling down low voltage wire if you use the wrong stable for the wrong wire problems could arise
DIY,not_removed,this remind me there is a cat owner who lives on the third floor of the complex i live in they let the cat chill out on the balcony and it just chills there and stares at you when you walk up to the building i call it the asshole cat because it just stares at you with this pretentious look with that being said i have seen it poke its head through the bars a couple times to find a way out it hasnt been dumb enough to jump yet though
DIY,not_removed,thank you
DIY,not_removed,
DIY,not_removed,
DIY,not_removed,plus she is a shorty so it is perfect
DIY,not_removed,theres a bunch of sturdy zip up catdog playpens these days we just ordered one to take our kitties outside in the good weather theyre also great for isolating a cat whos had surgery car travel or even hotel stays theyre around bucks pack flat and have stakes in case its windy if you have a ground floor or any type of yard theyd be great
DIY,not_removed,yes all i have to do when it gets cooler is remove the bolts that secure the vertical part of the white bracket to the plexi glass and wood on the inside then bring it into the house ill store the plexi separately so it doesnt get damaged this required no drilling into the window frame
DIY,not_removed,and i just found the same door on chewycom for fml this one locks and has a very nice seal
DIY,not_removed,love it
DIY,not_removed,duly noted i figured they would hold they are thick metal staples but ill have to find a better solution eventually
DIY,not_removed,mosquitoes and moths is about it this is better sealed than my window ac units so im not worried
DIY,not_removed,thanks
DIY,not_removed,i like the fence staple ideaill revise thanks
DIY,not_removed,jesus
DIY,not_removed,im not the one that downvoted you but ill answer in my personal case why i dont let my cats out im from australia where theres lots of nocturnal marsupials that are threatened by these nonnative predators cats to the point of near extinction cats are only partially domesticated they will still hunt instinctively even if theyre fed at home i live on a main road and on the blind spot just over the crest of a hill theres a decent chance theyd be killed by a car or possibly cause someone else to crash many people just plain dont like cats and my cats are the reason i stick around when i reach my lowest lows if anything happened to them i dont know what id do indoor cats from my experience are a lot more social and friendly vs outdoor roaming cats and in some ways more akin to a dog but incredibly low maintenance in comparison to dogs and fit in with my life much better
DIY,not_removed,no claws previous owner and she is terrified of going out indoor cat plus there is a fox and hawks around the neighborhood i dont want to see my baby flying away
DIY,not_removed,they are more prone to injurydiseaseinfectionfighting with other cats when theyre allowed outside they would also probably get hit by a car eventually
DIY,not_removed,my cat feels safe only when surrounded by walls when he finds himself in the outside he just spreads all over the surface and paralyzes with fright
DIY,not_removed,probably because he chose to own and care for a pet not his neighbourhood
DIY,not_removed,the door was the most expensive part at plexiglass was and the roll of fencing was i got the shelf and brackets from work and it was being tossed out but i think the brackets are each time was around hours including trips to ace hardware lol
DIY,not_removed,first floor of a split level so the shelf is about feet off the ground
DIY,not_removed,its under an eve so it shouldnt get wet the wire is galvanized and the shelf is outdoor treated
DIY,not_removed,tall she just wants to look at the birds plus she is a munchkin with legs
DIY,not_removed,yeah i had to be precise with how the plexi went up against the window frame even used a little spacer board not shown in the pic
DIY,not_removed,where do you live
DIY,not_removed,thats what my dad said lol the biggest thing though is every window is different so each would have to be custom plus they would probably be around because i just found the door for including shipping i may make another to improve the design with a one
DIY,not_removed,it poured last night and was happy the whole thing stayed completely dry it is under an eve
DIY,not_removed,i will be messaging you on utc to local time to remind you of month to send a pm to also be reminded and to reduce spam parent commenter can httpwwwredditcommessagecomposetoremindmebotsubjectdelete commentmessagedelete dont forget to add the time options after the of
DIY,not_removed,yes she can get a taste of the outside plus we have a post with bird feeders on it about feet away loves watching them on the ground and the feeders
DIY,not_removed,exactly
DIY,not_removed,this is awesome i may work up to this one day at first i bought the fencing that you have on your setup figured the would be more sturdy and secure though
DIY,not_removed,windowsills sunshine and fresh air if you think thats anticat then you are shitty to your cats
DIY,not_removed,maybe they have a coyote problem in my neighborhood there is a new missing catdog poster up every few days
DIY,not_removed,i always see dead cats run over sometimes no way in hell ill let my cat out and see him like that
DIY,not_removed,i love my cats too much for that i also love the environment too much for that cats are an invasive species killing off birds and harming local ecosystems
DIY,not_removed,outdoor cats ruin local ecosystems by killing for sport instead of survival leave them inside
DIY,not_removed,this comes up in every thread apparently in america its unusual to let your cats out here in the uk keeping your cats indoors seems cruel there its the other way around
DIY,not_removed,these people are emotional children who are attempting to justify placing their fear of harm to their pet above the animals happiness i guess theyre the kinda folks who would raise children in a protective bubble better not let little jimmy risk interacting with the world
DIY,not_removed,ive had both outside cats growing up and inside cats now nearly all of the outside cats i owned died too early from external sources its just not safe for cats in nonrural america and even there its not entirely safe due to coyotes cougars bobcats and other predators
DIY,not_removed,cool your cat only killed rats mine killed beautiful native song birds its almost like every cat is different
DIY,not_removed,my family had several outside cats growing up two were hit by cars and one licked antifreeze or some other poison and died im glad that your family cat didnt meet the same fate but some people dont like having their cats life be a game of chance at the whim of random people outside
DIY,not_removed,you clearly have done a ton of research and a lot of evidence in support of both how little damage cats do to the ecosystems if allowed to be outside as well as how little additional risk going outside is to your cat i applaud you providing such clear and compelling evidence and will go home and let my cats outside right now
DIY,not_removed,not cruel if it is an indoor cat
DIY,not_removed,eagles coyotes mountain lions bears cars people birds raccoons possums dogs any number of reasons really
DIY,not_removed,outdoor cats are a bad idea in general its nicer on your cat and the local wildlife to keep kitty safe inside
DIY,not_removed,you must not be from a city or live in a high rise
DIY,not_removed,aliens
DIY,not_removed,people will have their cat indoors if the cat is specifically rare or expensive so it doesnt get stolen it seems to be an american thing to have indoor only cats as a standard and they get very defensive if you tell them to let it outside
DIY,not_removed,cars and people for one why let an indoor cat out most indoor cats have no clue how to survive in the wild
DIY,not_removed,outdoor cats ruin local ecosystems by killing for sport instead of survival leave them inside
DIY,not_removed,she is an indoor cat they make those here in the usa
DIY,not_removed,just going to show my support down voting on this is too real cats years both they love outsideness ones a fat one who is scaredy as hell but super vocal about anything like shed swap at food givers in the morning p and complain she was bought from a brood while the other one is a stray kitten that was found by a family member during work incity this ones slick and never ever lets her claws out to the family deliberately only if she has i am about to fall reflex thing shes also the one with the sharpest claws p shes the hunter of the pair loving stalking the birds that like to fuck up our gardenvegetables outside oh how they chaseplay in the evenings in our backyard
DIY,not_removed,wtf are you saying
DIY,not_removed,i never knew it wasnt a thing outside the us id bet most cats in the us are indoor cats and many are declawed
DIY,not_removed,depending on where op is traffic predators prey cat thieves
DIY,not_removed,she would have no idea what to do she is terrified and will just want to come back in
DIY,not_removed,the cat running away is the least of my concerns its the aggressive feral cats the coyotes and the speeding cars
DIY,not_removed,nope i opened the door and when she saw what was going on after a few minutes she went in
DIY,not_removed,umm this is very weird
DIY,not_removed,i got her from a friend who has her declawed and always lived inside she is terrified of going out
DIY,not_removed,technically a munchkin is a type of cat bred specifically for a trait in having shorter legs and is much less able than a traditional cat munchkin owners are very highly recommended to keep their munchkin inside as they are more susceptible to predators and other cats due to their smaller stature and docile temperaments ragdoll cats are also in this category since they will just flop over and allow a local catdogpredator to do whatever they want without defending themselves
DIY,not_removed,once she found out what it was yes
DIY,not_removed,she can roam free in the house no need to go outside
DIY,not_removed,haha how isnt this ridiculous
DIY,not_removed,it would be torture for her if i put her outside
DIY,not_removed,cats that roam outside lead significantly shorter lives between shitty humans predators and endemic diseases like feline leukemia and fiv if your cat gets those diseases you wont know right away and hell spread them to your other cats letting your cats outside just means that you dont care if they get hurt or die because youre too lazy to give them a stimulating indoor environment
DIY,not_removed,its been a week and no bugs yet the door has a great seal
DIY,not_removed,not if you get her from a friend and has been previously declawed plus she is terrified to step outside not cruel at all
DIY,not_removed,fits the window perfectly and will be easy to take down once it gets cooler in the fall just like an ac unit
DIY,not_removed,true but they could just as easily break a window or remove an ac unit in the window next to it the window cannot move up anymore so i think its secure enough
DIY,not_removed,locks only keep honest people out if someone wants to get into your house theyll find a way
DIY,not_removed,the cat is ops security system
DIY,not_removed,or burgalars from coming in not everyone lives in a place where this is an issue
DIY,not_removed,she is an inside cat nothing stupid about it id bet more than half the cats in the usa are inside cats onlyexcept in rural and farm areas
DIY,not_removed,tl dr they do i have a catflap that will only let my cats in rfid and out only when its not dark anyway i woke up at about am one morning to hear one of my cats hissing thinking it was just my two cats fighting i flick the bedside light on to break them up the local stray tom had somehow broken into my catflap it locks from both sides so they cant pull it open i try and shoo him out but he freaks out i stupidly try and pick him up to throw him out the front door and get a pretty nasty bite on my hand a bunch of scratches and cat piss all over my wood floor note i have petted and picked up this stray cat before but obviously he was freaked the hell out at this point so was defending himself
DIY,not_removed,i had a cat that would come visit us my cats were scared of the outside and the flap door so they would never use it this little girl would come in eat their food sleep for a while and then go home i dont know why but my cats seemed to be ok with it
DIY,not_removed,you can get collars that unlock the doors when your animal gets in range at least they had them in the hangover
DIY,not_removed,raccoons do too my fil always had dry food for his cats in the basement and the raccoons came through the flap and started eating it so fil moved it up to the main floor raccoons followed sometime in early autumn we wake up one night to cats and raccoons in a fight and raccoons stuck in the main floor bath defecating everywhere we had fleas forever before i put my foot down and insisted on bombing the house even though fil wanted to wait for the first freeze
DIY,not_removed,had one neighborhood cat that occasionally snuck into my house that way hed always hightail it out if i made a move towards him so what i did was one time when i saw him i closed all the other inside doors went outside the other way walked around the house to the door with the catflap and went inside thus hed have to come towards me to get free i locked the catflap picked up a scrap piece of carpet i had laying around and started chasing that cat he immediately tried the cat door panicked sprinted into the rest of the house all doors closed we luck there with me whaling on him with this piece of carpet everything he got near good fun while it lasted eventually he got so terrified that he threw himself bodily at the cat flap so hard that the thin plexiglass door actually bent in the frame enough to let it slip over the lock clips and out he went never saw that cat in my house again
DIY,not_removed,this guy found a solution now urine luck
DIY,not_removed,put your thing down flip it and reverse it

DIY,not_removed,all the outside cats possums raccoons and other assorted wildlife tasty critters that think they want to be inside the stew pot fyftfyfy
DIY,not_removed,give the babies some fresh air and a bit of that vitamin d it was a different time that kid was probably on break from their factory job
DIY,not_removed,may not look sturdy but every time you step out on a balcony youre standing on a protruding concrete slab or wooden framework if secured to the window frame properly i dont see the problem with a tiny baby balcony
DIY,not_removed,its an invention to help babies get fresh air when people where moving into cities it never caught on though dangling babies from windows was not even acceptable by standards
DIY,not_removed,at least he has a cage he can see through
DIY,not_removed,people didnt used to be such pussies theres your context
DIY,not_removed,yikes
DIY,not_removed,dam son
DIY,not_removed,apparently not
DIY,not_removed,too soon
DIY,not_removed,no mom baby cageplaypen is not tomatotomahto
DIY,not_removed,naaah its kind of funny to walk into the bathroom and see kitty butt what i dont get is that he went through all the effort to make himself a peephole but didnt bother to make it big enough for him to fit through its literally just the size of his head hes so weird
DIY,not_removed,that is one beautiful cat
DIY,not_removed,thats some advanced shit right there
DIY,not_removed,with my blurry eyes the first picture looks like a person in cat costume with their legs dangling something very creepy about the way i thought the catperson was looking at the camera
DIY,not_removed,crazy question does the cat stay in your yard because its fenced in couldnt it jump from the tree into a neighbors yard or something and escape
DIY,not_removed,thats awesome i want to make him tunnels and all like yours
DIY,not_removed,thats awesome
DIY,not_removed,this is the style that my partner and i plan on making on the back of our house we want them to have a full patio to hang out on with enough room to run around basically an outside room
DIY,not_removed,dont you know the less it looks like a storebought product the more a cat enjoys it
DIY,not_removed,he loves it
DIY,not_removed,no one needs to know that part
DIY,not_removed,cat boyfriend in this case so yes
DIY,not_removed,yeah they look like sex chains hahah we also have hanging flowers from the bottom now where the chains were hooked onto looks much better i was just too excited so i started taking photos as soon as it was up
DIY,not_removed,we didnt want to do that part either but it was way too heavy not to thats why we also had the sex chains above to see if that would keep it sturdy enough but it seemed to sketchy
DIY,not_removed,that on top of the fact that animals and bugs can go right into the window now along with the humidity added to the home by having that window open all of the time this is pretty bad for a home
DIY,not_removed,we matched them with the pillars or im not sure my dad found the spot of where to screw them and we built it according to where we can hang it but thats good to know its also not vinyl i dont know if that makes a difference
DIY,not_removed,does that not defeat the purpose might as well just let the cat look through a window
DIY,not_removed,ah ok i get it now i was wondering if your aced air was just pouring out of that window but since you have a plexiglass door it makes a lot more sense
DIY,not_removed,for whatever fucking reason i was reading about cats and doors the other day on reddit fucking reddit im super allergic to cats i do not need this information apparently cats dont get it and you can spend days trying to train the cat with different tricks and whatnot the other option is to grab the fucker and shove them through and they learn immediately the first time
DIY,not_removed,i did a allplexiglass patio for my cats so it was open to the inside think i still have some pictures of it will post when i get home
DIY,not_removed,thanks me foreigner no good at english couldnt find the word
DIY,not_removed,httpsiimgurcomjzpfvuxjpg its not your screws its inherent to the crossbraces design try to flex the l shaped piece take out the cross brace you can i wouldnt worry though because in your case its heavily overdimensioned for the size of cat but i would not be using it to hold him if this is out of an apartment window
DIY,not_removed,it should be like httpimgurcomapnqgiu but dont worry it will hold the cat
DIY,not_removed,you just met some non americans p
DIY,not_removed,tell me about it i had no idea i wouldve gotten this reaction from so many people they all seem to be nonamerican too
DIY,not_removed,i suppose you didnt think about all the birds that are killed for no reason and left whole on the sidewalks
DIY,not_removed,in the uk if you told someone you dont let your cat go outside whenever it wants they would think youre an evil person
DIY,not_removed,both of my cats are indoor cats im just to terrified something would happen to them sometimes when i drive somewhere and see a road kill my heart skips a beat and i think at least that wont happen to my cats we have big enough house for them to run around and they were never let outside since they were wee kittens so they dont miss it and seem more than perfectly happy
DIY,not_removed,you dont even need to train them they do it naturally i think not letting your cat come and go as they please using a cat flap is weird god knows why you are being downvoted
DIY,not_removed,its bad for bird populations
DIY,not_removed,choo choo
DIY,not_removed,you might want to add a prop to keep the window pressed down on it just in case
DIY,not_removed,good luck i made one for my cats and they demand to go out no matter the weather
DIY,not_removed,ah ok thanks
DIY,not_removed,i knew it thanks
DIY,not_removed,ha nice absolutely loving it out there good work
DIY,not_removed,you will want to make sure it angles out as well blowing wind could put water on the shelf and if it is angled in at all that water will be in places you do not want water just a slight outward slope so it runs away from the window is all you need
DIY,not_removed,aww
DIY,not_removed,ah i see there are cats of all kinds but i usually run into ones that cant sit still so i got a bit curious thanks for the clarification
DIY,not_removed,in finland
DIY,not_removed,thanks if they spent more time near the fence itself id have considered tighter but theyve had this about months and its been a non factor
DIY,not_removed,fox and hawks plus no claws
DIY,not_removed,always see dead cats sometimes yeah i wouldnt want my pet always sometimes dead too
DIY,not_removed,survival of the fittest s
DIY,not_removed,in rural parts if say almost all cats are outdoor here in the suburbs its probably she doesnt have claws previous owner and there are fox and hawks in the area
DIY,not_removed,yeah i dont get it ive always had cat flaps i dont have a fancy cage strapped to the house i just let them come and go as they please and i have never known anybody that doesnt do that with their cats thats half the point of having cats they take care of themselves walkthemselves and shit in the ditoutside and bury it
DIY,not_removed,its not unusual to let your cat out lots of people do its just irresponsible and risky in my experience its only trashy people who let their cats roam
DIY,not_removed,or the biggest actual reasons dirt ticks fleas etc
DIY,not_removed,and aliens
DIY,not_removed,ill add disease to the list
DIY,not_removed,i kept my cats indoors for years then recently i got an apartment with a yard area down below my balcony i got the cats chipped then i built a cat ramp out of and carpet remnants and fastened it to my balcony rail so the cats can come and go all they do is go out into that area chew on the grass and sit in the bushes for a while then they come back inside it seems to improve their mood they like it and they look happier if anything alarms them they run back inside they arent capable hunters they cant catch a bird or rodent sometimes they bring me twigs and leaves soon i will train them to drop their dook in the bushes so i can get rid of the catbox which is the real reason for this effort
DIY,not_removed,nicer on your cat it has no idea what joys of hunting and sunbathing it is missing out on while you dress it up and play house live a little
DIY,not_removed,i hope it was not intentional to distort the picture but please correct feral cats and strays not house cats are responsible for majority of the killings house cat is not equal to indoor cat
DIY,not_removed,painfull facts
DIY,not_removed,yeah i guess it depends on where you live i pretty much live in the middle of the forest so i let my cat outside all the time shes years old so far
DIY,not_removed,ive always got outside cats who can go out and go in whenever they want with door cats all my cats died of old age so your argument is totally false cats are naturally outdoor animals they wont be happy if they cant go out what does an indoor cat do the most of his days looking at the windows
DIY,not_removed,what no love for
DIY,not_removed,nice friend you got there
DIY,not_removed,makes sense
DIY,not_removed,i think we just have to disagree about that however if there are alot of birds around i hope you let the cat go in and out of that cage by itself i can guess it can be pretty terrifying for the cat to be so exposed
DIY,not_removed,a cat that is vaccinated fixed and has yearly check ups at the vets has a life expectancy of years in the uk where most people let their cats go outdoors but also care for them the life expectancy of a pet cat in the us where people seem to keep them in is also years according to everything i can find online the life expectnacy of outdoor cats in the us might be lower due to the high number of preadtors and disease carrying animals that is much less the case in the uk which brings me back to my original point if you live in an enviroment that isnt relatively safe then dont own a cat and i say relatively safe because nothing is ever truely safe but that doesnt stop us leaving the house or letting our kids play in the street
DIY,not_removed,sad that they declawed her 😭
DIY,not_removed,put up a please do not pet the wombat sign
DIY,not_removed,thats one thing my fiancé likes to remind me of when i insist on locking the doors i grew up in the suburbs where theres security doors and windows all over the house where we live we dont even have a fly screen our front door is a sliding glass door if someone really wanted to get in a lock wont stop them
DIY,not_removed,i always come down your chimney
DIY,not_removed,i love this lol
DIY,not_removed,earth not everyone lives on earth because that is the place where this is an issue
DIY,not_removed,i have a catflap that will only let my cats in rfid and out only when its not dark damn that is sweet details plz home made or commercial product
DIY,not_removed,how long ago was this did you go to a doctor after the bite if not you should have bites can very very easily get infected plus rabies is a very unfortunate way to die there is a window where you can basically eliminate the risk of contraction but the catch is that it must be done before symptoms set in that window of time can vary being as short as less than a week to years in length although its usually months its however long it takes the virus to reach your brain from the point of infection its too late to go to a doc when you start feeling funny as by that point the virus is already in your head and mortality at that point is over
DIY,not_removed,i had a sweet little black cat come in through my cat flap a few months ago trouble is she didnt account for our large munsterlander being inside it was absolute chaos with him and my two cats charging around the house like lunatics after the invader for minutes or so eventually we managed to shut our animals in a room and found a very scared little black and white cat hidden behind the settee after making sure she was ok to be picked up just took her back outside she disappeared pretty quickly i kind of thought that cats generally have a little better self preservation than shown by this one anyway she hasnt been back so that says something our cat gave birth yesterday to seven little cats
DIY,not_removed,set it to the one way let your cats out but not in let them in in the morning problem solved
DIY,not_removed,possums too we finally had to humanely trap one persistent guy and drive him out to the woods he was eating our cats food somehow getting it all wet and also dropping food into their water bowl every single night
DIY,not_removed,scrap piece of carpet im just imagining you in battle mode tearing carpet off you floor to go to war with a cat
DIY,not_removed,why not invert the plexiglass and fencing too so the cats walk through a shitty hole cut in fence into a sealed plastic cube
DIY,not_removed,look at the adorable tail it has
DIY,not_removed,i see what you did there
DIY,not_removed,my son would love the shit out of this i wouldnt actually do it though
DIY,not_removed,thanks its every bit as nuts as i expected
DIY,not_removed,you dont want the baby stinking up the house when its time for a smoke
DIY,not_removed,different time you still see these in brooklyn
DIY,not_removed,babies in the all looked like they needed some prozac or something
DIY,not_removed,its not the idea of it that bothers me its the execution of it in that picture that looks like it should be in rdiwhy
DIY,not_removed,my understanding is that it did start to pick up in london for a while but for some reason fell out of fashion during the blitz
DIY,not_removed,is this what eric clapton said
DIY,not_removed,that is hilarious i assumed hed clawed the rest of the way through and escaped already
DIY,not_removed,yes thats what we called her superman pose the favorite position when lounging
DIY,not_removed,just a little wood some paint nails staples and chicken wire built it about years ago and its held up pretty well through a few california seasons
DIY,not_removed,the girl cat in the picture did in stay in the yard and never jumped over the fences she would however jump up on the roof and spy about she was a rescue cat from the pound that was very skittish in fact she lived under my bed for about two years with her brother before she finally calmed down to relax about when i was home i have had a cat that jumped the fences regularly but it didnt cause any trouble and retuned by the time i was home from work in california we have coyotes so the exit and roof access was closed off after cat curfew to keep them safe
DIY,not_removed,thanks when i was planning out the cage i figured theyd need something to scratch on so i bolted an old cat tree in there
DIY,not_removed,its ok that mines not movie quality
DIY,not_removed,sounds like its structurally good and thats smart and yeah not vinyl probably helps
DIY,not_removed,but now its like a ° window my cat sits at the window all the time but once a bird or bunny goes a little bit out of the way he loses sight
DIY,not_removed,how its just an additional screen its still a patio just with extra bug deterrent
DIY,not_removed,it would have a more of view at the least
DIY,not_removed,what is the purpose exactly i guess its a place where cats dont go outside because there are dangerous predators because usually cats will just sit outside on the windowsill
DIY,not_removed,that was my first thought but i wanted her to feel the air if she cant get used to the cat door that may be my only option love to see pics
DIY,not_removed,there is a door check out the pictures
DIY,not_removed,wow great tip thanks
DIY,not_removed,i agree and appreciate the time you took to draw that i just didnt want to put holes in my new siding
DIY,not_removed,strange quite the opposite in the us especially where i live nyc there are so many feral cat colonies the nyc streets are not ideal for house cats
DIY,not_removed,ive always wondered what do you do if you live in a second floor flat and have a cat i assume you just keep them inside at that point
DIY,not_removed,cats have been living in europe for so long that they have basically become a native species also the natural enviroment in the uk is almost manmade keeping cats is a lot more problematic in the new world where they are either an invasive species or not equipped to deal with the predators
DIY,not_removed,im sure i had to promise my rescue in the us that my cat would always be an inside cat before they let me pay to adopt but she picks fights with the other animals and throws up and is generally the cranky bea arthur of our family she never wins pet of the month we started doing a trial of outside time she was an outside cat before so not a noob to the dangers of suburbia now she eats a ton of grass so her tummy is more settled she gets more exercise and shes queen of the yard she loves it shes still a little pissy when she comes in like at night or if theres unfavorable weather pretty much when she wants but we are all better for her outside time
DIY,not_removed,outdoor cats tend to get hit by cars pretty often in brooklyn feral cat colonies with all kids of infections are common shit another problem weve been having lately is people leaving out food for animals laced with poison or broken glass
DIY,not_removed,its bylaw in my city to keep all cats indoors
DIY,not_removed,my cats have gone outside before and they always come back its not a matter of training however all my cats have been indoor cats for a bunch of reasons too many carspredators outside and they fuck with the ecosystem plus they get dirty as hell outside and then want to chill on my couch and refuse baths plus the shots are expensive and there really is not much of a benefit to them going outside since cats arent like dogs just play with them inside and its enough
DIY,not_removed,we let our cat out on the front porch and on the deck outside hes not once left the porch or gone down the deck stairs
DIY,not_removed,i think owning a pet that you let wander around outside unattended is weird i feel bad for the birds in your neighbourhood
DIY,not_removed,httpwwwrspborgukmakeahomeforwildlifeadvicegardeningunwantedvisitorscatsbirddeclinesaspx there is no scientific evidence that predation by cats in gardens is having any impact on bird populations ukwide
DIY,not_removed,no worse than extensive farming loss of habitat cities and suburbs lots of glass to fly into wind turbines and climate change a bird can with relative ease escape most cats its much harder to escape direct human impact
DIY,not_removed,i thought about it but the window is up as far as it can go thanks
DIY,not_removed,listen to this guy you dont water water draining into your sill
DIY,not_removed,excellent tip
DIY,not_removed,better pic
DIY,not_removed,better pic of her short legs
DIY,not_removed,i cant speak for the rest of the world but in the us most people keep their cats indoors due to urban dangers growing up in the country our cats were indooroutdoor cats we lived back from the main road and never had one ever get hit but would want them indoors at night to be safe from other predators now i live in a subdivision and wouldnt dare let my cats out
DIY,not_removed,yup same its a weird concept
DIY,not_removed,also parasites hawks toxic plants cat fights dead preybirds theft
DIY,not_removed,also aliens
DIY,not_removed,they cant catch a bird or rodent i thought the same thing until i saw my year old cat catch a mouse for the first time everyone involved including the cat was super stoked about it except for the mouse that mouse was a total wet blanket about the whole thing
DIY,not_removed,yeah in australia theres just too much wildlife and they tend to wander too far and theres actually laws about then being outside after a certain time now
DIY,not_removed,i tried this and all my cat came back with was worms i then had to keep him in the bathroom where i could easily clean up and where he could stay away from the other cats
DIY,not_removed,not when theyve been raised their whole life indoors mine got out once and stopped at the steps she had no idea how to get down
DIY,not_removed,just fyi they dont bring the kill home to feed the family they bring it home because they want to inspectplay witheat it in a safe area
DIY,not_removed,but clearly your cats were outdoor cats there are actually cats who wont or cant go outside
DIY,not_removed,if a cat is not raised going outside you keep it inside and if you dont live in a area where they would be safe going outside you keep them inside by the way this is not a cat cage did you even look at the post
DIY,not_removed,bears and wolves are a major concern where i live and people are known to shoot or otherwise hurt wandering cats i wouldnt feel safe letting them roam
DIY,not_removed,what youre saying makes no sense of course its possible for cats to live outside and never get diseasesget hit by carsget eaten by predators but statistically meaning not just your experience but a combination of a lot of different peoples experiences a much more valuable tool than just listening to your story and assuming that it represents what everyones experience will be an outdoor cats life will be years shorter than an indoor cat saying that this fact is totally false because you had a different experience is pretty stupid
DIY,not_removed,im glad your cats had such long happy lives but my first cat got hit by a car when he was only three years old i have an indoor cat now and hes very happy
DIY,not_removed,yes the cage is hers to use as she pleases there is a chair below and a shelf in front of it for her to go in shes unfortunately been declawed and there are fox and hawks around add other outdoor cats and she has no way to defend herself plus she is terrified of going outside she starts shaking if i carry her out the door
DIY,not_removed,my home is perfectly safe for her and is very happy she is terrified to go outside believe me remember cats chose to be domesticated we didnt force it on them years ago
DIY,not_removed,our flat is left unlocked admittedly by accident of the time my flat mate never locks his car we have never had trouble i think you might just be from a place where this is an issue
DIY,not_removed,its a commercial product there are a few more options available than when i bought mine i got the top one which has both rfid to read your pets microchip and a light sensor some of the cheaper ones may not have the double lock to prevent smart cats from pulling the flap open from the outside i was actually tempted to make myself a couple of feeders with two of those some plastic boxes then a dry food dispenser so i can just have a hopper with a weeks worth of food in it that is dispensed morning and evening this would then mean that each cat could only access their own food but not each others in the end it didnt seem worth doing for the cost
DIY,not_removed,i went to the doctor the day after and got antibiotics it was probably a year or so ago now thanks for your concern
DIY,not_removed,i feel like people grossly misrepresented rabies while i was growing up youll get rabies was nearly synonymous with youll catch a cold to me maybe it also did to everyone else who ever said that to me but ill be sure to add and die a painful death to the end of the statement for now on
DIY,not_removed,so guess who is never touching a stray cat ever again
DIY,not_removed,sensationalize much a rabid cat would not have come in through a cat door
DIY,not_removed,i expected to just see a photo of a skeleton
DIY,not_removed,i was fine with most of that until she sliced open the brain for some reason that really creeped me out watching how easily it cut
DIY,not_removed,our cat gave birth yesterday to seven little cats congrats
DIY,not_removed,possums wash their hands before they eat they also rinse their food off if you didnt know that
DIY,not_removed,if the other sides are plexiglass there would be no point in putting the fence there in the first place
DIY,not_removed,the only reason i wouldnt do it is because id expect to be arrested
DIY,not_removed,i dont think its that nuts honestly if its built properly i dont see the danger i guarantee its far less dangerous than taking your baby anywhere in your car but millions upon millions of people do that every day
DIY,not_removed,i was more blown away by the travel platforms
DIY,not_removed,fell out of fashion
DIY,not_removed,he sang it in the key of a flat minor
DIY,not_removed,lol no i think it might be too high for him so he seems perfectly content to just stick his head out every so often my mom lets him out if he wants to so i dont even know why he had to have his own peephole in the bathroom
DIY,not_removed,awesome thanks for the response im looking to buy a house within the next year or two and trying to see what my options are for giving the cats some outside time
DIY,not_removed,once a bird or bunny goes a little bit out of the way he loses sight aw shit anything but that
DIY,not_removed,°
DIY,not_removed,wait i think ive fucked up is window screen a netmesh ive never heard a fly net called that i interpreted it as they were going to build a screen of windows like a conservatory around it should not reddit when ive just woken up and should remember not everyone uses words in the same way
DIY,not_removed,actually cats are the dangerous predators in most neighborhoods cats are responsible for killing a substantial number of native birds as well as other small wildlife it sucks to admit but cats really shouldnt be allowed to free roam outside i think the solutions in this thread are a decent compromise
DIY,not_removed,there are many different reasons people choose not to let their cats outdoors most common reason is probably for the safety of the cat the average life span of an outdoor cat is two to five years compared to fourteen years for an indoor cat
DIY,not_removed,drats cant find any this was back in i didnt have a digital camera and i remember it was excessively difficult to get photos off my camera i do have the design renderings i made though i wound up painting it white but other than that it turned out great httpimgurcomablvix
DIY,not_removed,you could try finding long l brackets like the ones you already have but without the cross bar put those under the board in addition so it has some extra pushpull support
DIY,not_removed,even rural areas dead cats coyotes raccoons snakes wild dogs foxes hawks other cats bobcats carstrucks mean people etc i live in a rural area plenty of dead cats to go around
DIY,not_removed,yeah my neighborhood has cars speeding through it all the time we dont dare let the cat out
DIY,not_removed,at least half of the cat owners in the us have have come to accept the freespirited lifestyle cats desire and let them come and go as they please
DIY,not_removed,people have balconies that they let their kitties on a lot of the time my friends cat would never dare jump off the balcony she just chills for a little while and comes back in
DIY,not_removed,thats interesting i thought cats were being httpwwwaustralianwildlifeorgfieldprogramsferalcatsandfoxesaspx in australia to save native wildlife id be afraid of letting my cat out
DIY,not_removed,thats why i train them not to stray far from the house or stay out after dark
DIY,not_removed,wow fuck people
DIY,not_removed,theyll come back on their own but you need to train them to stay near the house and not go roaming the neighborhood
DIY,not_removed,i doubt my lazy useless cat has even for ft away from a bird hes really cute but hes lazy and retarded i get what you are saying about bird life although the wild bird population does very well in british cities i did hear a report recently stating that due to most countries in western europe allowing their cats to roam free many bird populations and door mouse populations are greatly affected that said i have had cats in my lifetime one was timid and just liked a roam around the garden current one is super friendly but super lazy but loves the grass and walking on fences one actually though nature was his friend despite all animals being terrified of him one hunted rabbits with miximatosis for an easy kill and the last one was a nutcase hunter that killed any non human animal near him but only for the first or years of his life for some reason and then stopped
DIY,not_removed,in canada theyve found cats to be a significant source of bird mortality news article study additional source with specific estimates and distinctions between bird species summary estimates presented here suggest a very substantial mortality of birds with roughly million birds killed annually by million outdoor cats
DIY,not_removed,while i applaud you for linking a scientific study the results are bullshit cats do kill and eat birds and they do have an effect on bird population edit million bird deaths from cats yet that isnt a significant blow to the population okay
DIY,not_removed,
DIY,not_removed,outdoor cats are very bad for wildlife they kill a lot of wildlife not just birds and spread disease obviously some threats are much greater like climate change but doesnt make the cat problem go away if anything its even more important that we take small steps like keeping our cats indoors to protect what wildlife we have left everything counts i dont think anyone is trying to guilt trip people who have outdoor cats obviously you cant just force an outdoor cat to stay indoors but folks should be aware of the issues
DIY,not_removed,
DIY,not_removed,thats adorable to the point where im worried she can move around like that same thing with really tiny dogs too but if its like that the size would make sense
DIY,not_removed,that goes without saying
DIY,not_removed,they seem to be concerns in america everybody just lets their cats out in the uk
DIY,not_removed,theres actually laws about then being outside after a certain time now where in australia
DIY,not_removed,you have to put worm ointment on them everynow and then works really well ive never had a cat that doesnt have a cat flap and ive never had a cat that has had worms
DIY,not_removed,exactly mine wouldnt even want to go outside
DIY,not_removed,keep theon in his cage and hell stay in his cage when his sister comes to visit
DIY,not_removed,wow your place seems really wild o the biggest predator my cat has are foxes no issues so far and people here would never shoot anything its a natural reserve
DIY,not_removed,ah sorry for my inital remark then
DIY,not_removed,yeah if she is a cat who naturally stays indoors then fair enough i disagree about the domesticated thing though barring a few breeds most cats are considered semidomestic most cats can survive without humans will leave home if mistreated in some way naturally good hunters etc cats started living around humans because humans attract vermin humans let them stay because they kill vermin so there was never a real domestication process but yeah there are a few breeds of cats that are basically domesticated and also some just wont want to go outside ever especially if not given chance when young however sadly lots of americans admit they have cats that want to go outside and try to get out
DIY,not_removed,its a very sexy roof
DIY,not_removed,who said anything about me or my experiences obvious fallacy attack the person rather than their argument do you know what the word anecdote means do you know how statistics work you cant draw the conclusions youve drawn using any rational or logical reasoning based on your incredibly limited data ive lived in high crime areas and done the same for years without issue fallacy it hasnt happened to me so far and so therefore it cannot happen ever fallacy youre a baffoon if you think you live somewhere exempt from crime
DIY,not_removed,knowing my dumbass cats theyd chew the wire on their way out and be unable to get back in or theyd get out of their rfid collar while out of doors also rfid cat feeder using similar tech has been done d httpssureflapcomenuspetfeedermicrochippetfeeder
DIY,not_removed,foaming mouth dog and cat bites just got elevated from code orange to code red right up there with snake bites
DIY,not_removed,you obviously never readwatched old yeller
DIY,not_removed,thank you its actually six we werent certain and didnt want to disturb her too much they all seem healthy though mothers a snow bengal fathers a random we tried to keep her in when she was on heat but it obviously didnt work kittens all look dark with some bengal stripes some are darker than others theyre all blobs at the moment though it wasnt a planned pregnancy we tried to keep her in when she was in heat shes only months old now we thought about breeding her with another snow bengal some time in the future but she was apparently too horny also if you know anyone in suffolk who wants a kitten in a few weeks ours will be available the mother is beautiful and a kind and sometime independent cat too
DIY,not_removed,i didnt know for sure but i suspected after i kept seeing the results
DIY,not_removed,no no no the door locks behind the cat and the plexiglass cage looks into a room filled with many small cokedup birds
DIY,not_removed,yup if i can verify that the cage is durable by putting quadruple the babys weight on all sides id do it but i know it would only be a matter of time before someone calls cps
DIY,not_removed,my dad made a raised bed above the cargo floor of our station wagon stuff could be stored under on long trips and we would sleep on top nice view out the side windows
DIY,not_removed,and those ancient car seats such safety
DIY,not_removed,holy shit i feel bad for laughing so hard at that
DIY,not_removed,it took me a second butha
DIY,not_removed,goddamn take that upvote already
DIY,not_removed,yeah window screen is basically just the netmesh they would probably just buy a roll of screen that is used on patios
DIY,not_removed,this is a window screen httpsefurdpropertiescomfilesscreenjpg
DIY,not_removed,really can you show me some sources for that my cats have all been outdoor cats and they are all old cats
DIY,not_removed,the wording in this article sound as if it is including full time outdoor cats including feral and strays into the average that is not comparable to partial outdoor cats with owners or probably even feral cats that are sheltered and fed
DIY,not_removed,this was like my original plan i was going to use angle iron and have a friend weld it together i may still as this was a first attempt thanks
DIY,not_removed,add to that owls hawks other peoples dogs cougarsmountain lions wolves ornery livestock not all of the world has subdued their nature to the extent the uk has
DIY,not_removed,and then they get bitched at for killing all the birds and the dangers of letting your cat outside
DIY,not_removed,yep that is precisely why cats should be neutered and kept inside
DIY,not_removed,not taking sides but did you read that article most of that is from non endangered populations who are actually increasing in number im still pro indoor cat vs outdoor cat
DIY,not_removed,im gonna trust the rspb here theyre a trustworthy organisation who if anything would be biased towards birds if they say theres not a problem im not going to disagree
DIY,not_removed,wow i had no idea its probably here in the usa
DIY,not_removed,depends on the council laws where my family lives theres a cat curfew we dont have one but we absolutely have to have them microchipped and desexed unless we have a breeding licence
DIY,not_removed,in queensland the law is to keep your cat contained which refers to indoors or a cat enclosure outside
DIY,not_removed,its america worm ointment might give your cat autism
DIY,not_removed,haha ive watched bears and moose wander right outside my house i dont think id feel safe letting my cats roam in the city either though mostly because i dont want to risk them getting diseases that are completely preventable by just keeping them in besides they both think theyre princesses they have no idea how to survive outside
DIY,not_removed,no prob
DIY,not_removed,wow chill this is not the kind of argument that needs that much energy put into it
DIY,not_removed,crime rates obviously vary drastically by region like between say rural wyoming and the bronx
DIY,not_removed,how did attack a person
DIY,not_removed,yeah i have two of those the problem is it only hold a days two meals really so if you want to go away for a weekend its not that good
DIY,not_removed,dogs and cats in the us are pretty safe from rabies i think bats are the number one spreader of rabies in the us so i guess dont go outside at night
DIY,not_removed,yeah probably someone called the police on us the other day just because we have our dog chained up outside and they thought that was cruel old dude doesnt even pull on his chain and its just there in case he sees a squirrel or something
DIY,not_removed,yeah we dont have them here or at least theyre rare enough that ive never seen one hence my confusion anything similar that we have id call a fly net and is normally hung in strips like or people just use lots of strings of beads should probably have worked it out
DIY,not_removed,i cant access the full article on mobile to determine how good the source is but here is the link its the citation i will edit this comment in a couple hours once i get home to add the original source if you find any info that conflicts with this id be interested in that too edit the literature on cat mortality and causes of death are limited some studies dont distinguish between outdooronly cats and indooroutdoor cats i cant say that the average life span is years for outdoor cats because the data are old all over the place regionally and there are too many confounds the original study was done in and is not even accessible this is its citation kraft w geriatrics in canine and feline internal medicine eur j med res – some interesting things i have found for those who do have access to outdoors cats between the ages of months to years were most likely to be in a road traffic accident this is probably because older cats are less active stay closer to home and are more cautious other variables like coat colour whether the cat was allowed outside at night season the amount of time spent outside and the time lived at an address can play a role too they found that trauma was the most common cause of sudden and unexpected death with of cases presumed to have been associated with a motor vehicle accident they found that risk of seropositivity was significantly higher in pet cats that were allowed outdoors if i find anything else ill add it i am not trying to make a case against outdoor cats but i am trying to better understand the variables involved if anyone has any other info i would be happy to read it as well
DIY,not_removed,same my family has had multiple outdoor cats only came inside for extreme weather and they all lived to be about at least maybe he meant feral cats
DIY,not_removed,which article i didnt link one in that comment
DIY,not_removed,theres no shortage of birds dont sweat it
DIY,not_removed,wow ill fiddle around with your boiler first
DIY,not_removed,i havent put any energy into it somebody sent a ridiculous message and it showed up in my inbox and i responded i hardly think a few clicks and keystrokes is that much energy
DIY,not_removed,hes got mvote in this arguement
DIY,not_removed,ohhhh cherry picking and taking statements out of context my favorite
DIY,not_removed,and my point is that no place anywhere on earth is immune to crime no matter how much their statistics vary everybody has this issue nobody is exempt is reading really this hard here wow
DIY,not_removed,i think you might just be from a place where this is an issue turning it on me rather than what im saying
DIY,not_removed,thanks drak
DIY,not_removed,httpwwwcdcgovrabieslocationusasurveillancehumanrabieshtml its not that big of a concern if you ask me you didnt but someone may
DIY,not_removed,i woke up one night hearing something scratching around on the floor i turned on the light and a bat started flying around the room i still have no idea how it got inside
DIY,not_removed,people seem to forget even though they are domesticated dogs are still animals usually bred for an actual purpose and besides a few stupid breeds like pugsbull dogs they are meant to be outside my uncle was was a trapper living in the far northern part of ontario and visiting for christmas and brought of his sled dogs with him we had tons of fun with the dogs we hooked them up to my gt and the speed they could reach and the raw power they have was just astounding anyways someone called the humane society because they were bedded outside in it took the better part of the afternoon explaining to them that they were sled dogs and bringing them inside would most make them overheat
DIY,not_removed,people are dumb cats and dogs have lived outside for thousands of years they are literally built for it most breeds anyway
DIY,not_removed,its fine to keep dogs outside if they dont bark if they bark at people then youre a horrible person
DIY,not_removed,where do you live
DIY,not_removed,how does that stop anything from getting into your house
DIY,not_removed,is not old for a cat all of my indoor cats have lived to be
DIY,not_removed,the one you linked in the followup reply as the source for the numbers
DIY,not_removed,its buffoon by the way
DIY,not_removed,yeah thats not an attack its a question
DIY,not_removed,yeah because if you get bit by a wild animal you get a rabies shot its just what you do if people didnt that figure would be significantly higher however a stray cat is setting the bar a little low
DIY,not_removed,i just wanted to point out that while the odds of getting it are low the risk is extremely high without getting vaccinated immediately it has a death rate thats not a joke it kills literally everyone who contracts it unless you give them the inoculation immediately after theyre bitten so if you get bit by a random animal and you have no way of knowing if it has rabies you need to get the shots despite it being so rare because if you did unluckily contract it and you wont know for about a month until you start showing symptoms you will literally die a horrible excruciatingly painful death within a few weeks and there is nothing a doctor can do to save you seriously nothing you are essentially moved to hospice once they get the diagnoses that its advanced rabies small note there has been exactly case in known science where the person lived without a vaccination immediately after being bitten but they did some crazy medical shit theyve never tried before she spent a month in a coma nearly died anyway and ended up with permanent nerve damage and has never been the same had to learn to walk again and stuff tldr always always always always get a rabies shot when youre bit by a random animal because while the chance of rabies is low the risk is extremely high death rate
DIY,not_removed,i guess were all gonna catch it now rip
DIY,not_removed,httpsenmwikipediaorgwikithecallofthewild
DIY,not_removed,eh hell bark at someone once a week its not horrible hes been an outdoor dog the years hes been alive you know what would be cruel if i kept him cooped up inside our house to me keeping an outdoor dog inside is way more horrible than letting him occasionally get his bark out but enjoying the freedom of the free air
DIY,not_removed,england theres a few months where you might get a handful of flies but nothing that bites or causes more than a minor annoyance dealing with a screen would be more annoying
DIY,not_removed,apparently it does flies arent the smartest of creatures
DIY,not_removed,average lifespan of a domestic cat is years im pretty sure all of our outdoor cats lived to be but i didnt feel like doing the math they for sure all lived to be though im sure it differs some due to breed ours were main coons and general mixed breed domestics but yeah outdoor cats tend to live shorter lives than their indoor counterparts edit also i feel like i should mention that these were family pets and my parents havent had any cats for a while now i have a cat and its an indoor cat i hope he lives to be
DIY,not_removed,the first article i agree i edited it earlier to add just that there arent very good numbers for the the life expectancy of outdoor cats because of confounds like you described
DIY,not_removed,thanks
DIY,not_removed,maybe youre new to reddit or passiveaggression in general but that was how one phrases an attack on reddit and even regardless of that youre being pedantic the point is they made it about me and my circumstances to discredit what im saying rather than addressing my actual argument that is very straightforward fallacy
DIY,not_removed,true my point is just that its silly to be scared of every bat you see
DIY,not_removed,cats can still get rabies but its uncommon because most jurisdictions require them by law to get vaccinated once a year doesnt mean everyone follows it but your vet will harass you about it and possibly report you if you refuse to get them vaccinated rabies is extremely dangerous as i outlined in an above comment with a mortality rate for people who do not immediately get a rabies shot after being bitten rabies is no fucking joke its extremely serious business and it totally blew my mind when i recently learned all of this because it was always a punchline when j was a kid when you found a stray animal or someones dog seemed mean etc it cannot be stressed enough how important it is to see a doctor and get the shots when youre bitten by a stray animal especially one that was previously nice and calm around you but is now reacting with hostility to you
DIY,not_removed,ahhaaaaaaaaaaaa righto chap the buzzywhizzes be much more plentiful me side o the pond cheers govna pip pip tallywhack and all that sorry my british is rusty but im practicing i hope this makes sense
DIY,not_removed,not having window screens is a super annoying aspect of living in england sure it wouldnt work because all the windows are different sizes and they all open outwards but i am pretty sick of having a hundred thousand moths flying into my flat when i want to let some cool air in at night
DIY,not_removed,ive had similar but mixed experiences growing up in a rural area we had one outdoor cat who lived to the ripe old age of and two others who sadly got hit by cars under the age of my moms got another cat who was previously an outdoor cat but had to make the transition to indooronly when she moved to the city because that cat is older anyway less active not interested in going out in winter the transition was surprisingly easy i personally live in a high traffic area and have an indoor cat hes and i hope he lives until as well
DIY,not_removed,i think one of the main differences is not indooroutdoor related but when the cats first get sick especially if they have a preexisting condition how long the owner chooses to draw out treatment i see some people keep their blind deaf barely able to walk cats alive to but i personally feel that is not good for the cat but rather for the person when my cats get sick and compromised functionally i feel the best thing to do for them them not for me is to give them a peaceful death so most of my outdoors cats lived to but i also did not extend their life significantly with surgerydaily medication etc im sure some people would strongly disagree with me and im not trying to argue its correct just that it plays a significant role in the average lifespan of domestic cats and dogs for that matter and in case its of interest most of them had hereditary heart defectstendency to aneurysm or started out first getting sick with severe kidney issues

DIY,not_removed,looks great op except for that bug
DIY,not_removed,our bedroom which is kind of long and narrow has a little alcove for the bed we wanted to do something to create some visual interest behind the bed and we saw this new product at lowes called timberwall theyre boxes of precut peel stick wood planks for wall decoration httptimberwallca we couldnt find a lot of information about them online but we decided to take the plunge anyway we are really happy with the resultsit makes the alcove feel deeper and really makes the whole room feel more open and less narrow click through the album for some detail shots and some of the lessons learned
DIY,not_removed,i like it does anyone think this would look funny if installed on a much larger wall with a vaulted ceiling would it lose its appeal if it was much wider and came to a point at the top
DIY,not_removed,anyway heres wondertimberwall
DIY,not_removed,i like how it looks id never seen this product before cool little design seems like its easy to work with
DIY,not_removed,wow i love your taste in interior designand ive never said that before but from that wall to those bedsheets to those doors to that pillow is that handmadehomemade to that dog and even the color of those doorseverything together brings that warm and cozy feel of my ideal future home thanks for sharing do you mind telling me a bit more about that pillow
DIY,not_removed,this is really cool any idea on how much the total cost was
DIY,not_removed,nice work im contemplating doing something similar but i hesitate because i feel like it would be very uncomfortable leaning against the wood when sitting up in bed have you given this any thought
DIY,not_removed,looks expensive for a wood wall i am wondering if free pallets will do same effect p
DIY,not_removed,someone really has gotten a nice idea of how to sell all the scrap they get at the lumber yard though it does look nice were the pieces prestainedoiled and sanded or did you have to do it yourself in the days of yore this was what went into inside walls with plaster finish
DIY,not_removed,i love all of this exactly my taste in interior design beautiful bed sheets too
DIY,not_removed,what are the lamps in the first picture they look really cool
DIY,not_removed,looks awesome but sounds a bit like a sales pitch
DIY,not_removed,looks good please buy a ladder stools are really really dangerous
DIY,not_removed,except for that bug ha right there with you hey that wall looks niceholy time to burn the house down
DIY,not_removed,maybe try taking a sample picture from ops wall pictures take a picture of your room then in photoshop or similar program paste the paneling over the section youre thinking of doing that might help you visualize it a bit better
DIY,not_removed,yeah its pretty clever its somewhat expensive but the finish is high quality the stains look really nice and its really easy to use i suppose you could save some money if you had a woodshop construction adhesive and some patience but for the size of our installation the prefab stuff totally made sense
DIY,not_removed,by bed sheets i mean both the one with lines on it and the one with birds you must be a birder to have that where did you get that
DIY,not_removed,same what was the total cost and do they ship directly
DIY,not_removed,yeah we thought about about this we considered arranging the planks so that the section wed be leaning back against would all be a consistent height but we were afraid that it would look weird we have some big eurosize pillows that we use as backrests anyway so it works out well enough
DIY,not_removed,haha yeah youre definitely paying for convenience with this stuff it would be a lot of work to do this from raw materials i think the planks are indeed prefinished we sanded the edges we had to trim ourselves of course but everything else is just out of the box
DIY,not_removed,from the ops girlfriend hanging lamp the shades we poached off some unfortunate looking table lamps from target the best shades have to be bought with lamp bases we just made sure a plug would fit through the spider of the lamp
DIY,not_removed,its not its a brand new product and i couldnt find any information about it besides the companys site so i wanted to post my project so others would have some info
DIY,not_removed,that bug pillow looks awesome imo
DIY,not_removed,didnt even think of that good call
DIY,not_removed,aw thanks the pillow came from a target store a couple of years ago we love it but its definitely the mostmentioned part of this project no matter who we show it to we are birders indeed good eye the bird comforter came from pottery barn and i am not sure where the quilt with the lines came from
DIY,not_removed,we probably spent just under for the whole project trim planks glue etc the planks themselves are sold in boxes of we had an area to cover so we bought boxes and we had maybe half a box leftover with very little waste from trimming i dont know if they ship to your location youd have to check with lowes on that one
DIY,not_removed,well i guess it depends on how big the pieces are initially before sanding staining and cutting them to size from say long planks decent industrial grade table circular saw cuts dozens of planks at a time so it wouldnt really take that long but its admittedly more convenient for diy people to have ready made pieces most of us cant afford a usd worth of equipment and the space to fit it in
DIY,not_removed,thank you

DIY,not_removed,quick question what tools did you need to do that im an apprentice carpenter and love joinery
DIY,not_removed,i used a table saw a hand planer to strip the original paint then a hand miter saw a coping saw a chisel kit a t square a speed square and an orbital sander for the sanding
DIY,not_removed,sweet its turned out pretty neat thats so cheap for a chisel kit in the uk it costs way too much for tools
DIY,not_removed,is there a capstone or top course that extends out past the stones if not that might be whats letting the moisture get between the wall and stone does it have weep holes on the non retaining side

DIY,not_removed,yes there is weep holes im not sure ill have to check tomorrow
DIY,not_removed,eh with the cap its not all that important without weep holes the moisture could be sitting and wicking through the wall and deteriorating the grout but that should have shown up much sooner than now
DIY,not_removed,so that holder doesnt seem to be the right one for that shower head how nice are you wanting this to look vs the level of function vs cost and effort you want to put in if you want functional only i would recommend a bigass carabiner and some good for metal put the carabiner on that hangar with the epoxy and let that operate as your holder from now one pros it works you dont have to dick with removing the current hangar and trying to find a new one cons it will look kinda like ass alternative find a new look at the measurements of the products vs those of the handle on your showerhead make sure it fits follow the instructions to mount it take special care that you either use drywall anchors which should probably come with the device or drill it shower curtain this is a bit more difficult because of the positioning of the window and the sink i would recommend mounting your shower curtain from the ceiling using again use the mounting instructions that come with them and for gods sake when mounting into the ceiling use drywall anchors past that just get a rod and curtain tools needed for this endeavor include small batter operated drillscrewdriver they are all over amazon for in fact if you are truly a beginner a cool little set for you you arent going to be building any houses with it but it has some basics you will need around the house if any of these break that shows you that you use it enough to warrant something more expensive

DIY,not_removed,sorry what do you mean by carabiner i tried googling it but im not sure how id use that as a holder i might just be having a blonde moment functional and cheap is ideal thanks for the tips with the shower curtain ill look into that i think my mum should have the tools around the house already but cheers for the suggestion
DIY,not_removed,a caribiner is a hook with a built in latch you would use the epoxy to basically glue the small side of the caribiner to the holder make it flat parallel with the horizon make sense
DIY,not_removed,try a channel lock with a thick washcloth between the cap and channel locks so you dont scratch the finish they also sell channel locks without the teeth like the one i linked above so it wont scratch chrome nuts but it might not work if the cap youre unscrewing is round and doesnt have straight edges like the top of a hex nut you can also try a strap wrench
DIY,not_removed,if the part your trying to take off is hexagonal you can use an adjustable wrench or supply warehouses sell whats basically a really large hand operated socket set measure the size you need and pick one up if youve got the size socket and are still having trouble the holes are so you can slip something like a screw driver through and twist

DIY,not_removed,looks great op now let the comments begin about how pallet wood is going to disfigure your first born and murder your family in their sleep
DIY,not_removed,nice work my only suggestion is using a flush or sunken fastener on top raised fasteners catch on things i realize that youre going for a certain industrial look but try to find a way to get the look without sacrificing functionality im thinking countersunk hex heads black to match or silverstainless to contrast
DIY,not_removed,those look fantastic they would be perfect for my dads man cave great work
DIY,not_removed,these are really badass
DIY,not_removed,nice build ive run into your problem with shiny bolts in the past my uncle suggested bluing solution used for guns it worked pretty well
DIY,not_removed,those look professionally made nice job
DIY,not_removed,to be fair nobody knows what chemicals leached in there
DIY,not_removed,you used pallet wood looks nice and all but did you factor in that pallet wood may only last years so i guess its great you made a short term solution but honestly if you wanted a coffee table that last a lifetime you should have gone to a redwood forest and get some wood joking
DIY,not_removed,right that or my utter lack of basic diy safety
DIY,not_removed,i was going to use carriage bolts originally since theyre lower profile but the need for a square hole threw me off i dont really have the tools to do that my worry with something like that is that it requires tapering the metal considering how much i torqued those bolts to pull everything flush would that kind of fastener hold up
DIY,not_removed,thats more what the room is going to be i think
DIY,not_removed,thats another approach i hadnt thought of ill keep it in mind for the future
DIY,not_removed,thanks i hope they stand the test of time as well as they look like they will
DIY,not_removed,well as long as no one licks the unvarnished side
DIY,not_removed,you dont strictly need a square hole if the threads arent mangled for carriage bolts just drill a hole in the metal a little smaller than the square corner diagonal distance kitty corner and the square end will snug up enough that you can tighten the bottom nut if the hole is too small it might distort the metal too lose and the bolthead might turn to taper you just need a counter sink thats rated for metal the hardest part is getting the same amount of counter sink on each hole because its against metal and not wood pulling through shouldnt be a problem
DIY,not_removed,i hate to be that guy really i do but heres the thing ive been working in manufacturing for years in a number of different plants and we deal with pallets and send em off for recycling and such all the time its very normal for unused pallets to be literally soaked in rat urine as they get stacked outside before usage and they make really excellent rat metropolises then once theyre used its perfectly normal for pallets to end up soaked in all manner of really toxic chemicals really horrible ones theres little to no controls over it either no matter what they get soaked with they all get shipped off together it can be a serious health issue if you get the wrong pallets and dimensional lumber is really really cheap ok feel free to tar and feather me now with that said damn they do look awesome
DIY,not_removed,that makes me pretty grossed out about my friends pallet vegetable garden but wouldnt sealing pallets in a clear coat mitigate the concerns of having them in your home
DIY,not_removed,i dont know to be honest it just freaks me out because i see the things that dozens of pallets get soaked in every single day i wont even touch them without gloves anymore and they go to the same place that everyone elses pallets go to i mean you get pallets that havent been chemically contaminated theres still a strong likelyhood that theyre soaked in vermin urine but once theyve been used in manufacturing ugh i mean i could post the health warning data sheets for the chemical compounds ours are frequently covered with theyre dangerous contact carcinogens just handling the wood could be bad for you i dont know how long it would remain dangerous vs weather and evaporation probably not long but i know how those chemicals burn the shit out of your skin with direct exposure and that theyve sunk into the wood i wouldnt want to find out and definitely not for a garden maybe the clear coat will do it i honestly dont know i wouldnt try though and just buy cheap dimensional lumber
DIY,not_removed,better to have an electrician add a new proper outlet than make a dryer extension cord
DIY,not_removed,my two bits worth undersize wire is a common source of fires and it sounds like what youve got is just too small also never ever replace a fuse with a bigger fuse ever dont make me come over there and hit you fuses do one thing and one thing only and thats to protect the wire from that point on from being exposed to enough current to turn it into a fire first choose the size wire you need httpwwwintercablescoukequipmentampacityratingsindexphp note i would recommend going one gauge larger because it gives you safety margin and also reduces voltage drop the drier you have is a condenser drier which means it uses a heat pump to create the heat rather than a heater element so it uses far less electricity according to the spec sheet it uses watts which at the listed as standard for the uk works out to be amps i would recommend using a rated cord heres one rated at for six pounds or here just buy that and call it done
DIY,not_removed,in the united states we can just buy extension cords made for this sorta thing also none of he information youve given me seems to be compatible with us standards so im going to have trouble helping in the mean time if you cant actually find an extension cord made for your drier you can try looking up the outlet you require and seeing if you can find the specs on that over here that information is common and written on the box
DIY,not_removed,i am wondering if i then cut the extension cord to length would be between meters of used cord once im finished rewire the plug and replace the fuse with a fuse would this be reasonably safe no this is how you start an electrical fire check your dryer and find the maximum current draw google the dryer model number and find the manual online if this is not written on the dryer somewhere you can make your own extension cord but every part of that cord both the wire and the plugs must be rated for at least the maximum number of amps the dryer and preferably around more then the max as a safety margin if you do make your own cord you might want to think about if you want waterproofing and locking waterproof wire and locking plugs exist but they cost quite a bit more
DIY,not_removed,amps seems pretty low times amps is only watts over here in the us most household driers are rated at amps which would be times or watts there are lots of amperage gauge wire charts on the internet just check one of those i dont know what gauge wire is called in the uk but that would be the thinnest i would work with if all else fails just wire it up and keep checking it with your hand if the wire gets hot then it is too skinny the correct size wire should stay cool or mildly warm never hot
DIY,not_removed,this is the correct answer
DIY,not_removed,over here in the us most household driers are rated at amps which would be times or watts normally driers here are and not so at would be watts
DIY,not_removed,oh yeah my bad you are entirely correct thats what i get for reading reddit late at night
DIY,not_removed,where in dallas is this store located been trying to locate a goodreputable place to source good wood nice work
DIY,not_removed,love this
DIY,not_removed,like i said i just go through their scraps dont know what regular wood prices are but this table cost me about in wood and i have a couple pieces of walnut left pm me for info
DIY,not_removed,thanks
DIY,not_removed,made this sloppy leather skiving knife for my leatherwork and decided to make a video out of it enjoy
DIY,not_removed,yes youll want to use stakes and orange string to mark off where you roughly want the parking area to extend sometimes you may need to tilllevel the area or get a machine that compacts the dirt you can rent these at hardware stores go to lowes and get those wooden planks that frame flower beds and hold in mulch put them along that string area you marked off to hold in the new gravel in the parking inlet if you dont get the pieces of wood to outline it when you spread the gravel it wont stay where you want it and will slowly dissipate the more it is driven upon otherwise youll just have to order more the longer and longer you put off paving it isnt cheap this method is a quick fix and it looks pretty good too you can even plant shrubs to line the area for privacy order the gravel and have it delivered this should tide you over for the time being hope that helps

DIY,not_removed,thanks any guesses for how long the gravel will stay on top of the top soil also larger or smaller gravel recommended size
DIY,not_removed,i bought my house about three years ago and the previous owners had created a secondary driveway doing exactly this peasized gravel we had no interest or need for the secondary driveway so we ignored it the grass dirt and soil have almost completely reclaimed the area now and you almost cant even tell there was any gravel there unless you stick a trowel into the ground
DIY,not_removed,depends on how much traffic you expect to have if it were a gravel driveway you can expect things to dissipate within a month or so if you use the planks to line your new parking area you may need to push that gravel into your driveway from the one that is already paved from cars pulling out it should last a decent while if you make sure to line it go with a medium sized granite gravel definitely dont do a pea gravel that will get covered in mud and the car will push that gravel into the soil youll waste money plain grey mediumsized gravel where the stones are an inch and a half to two inches when you go to the hardware store tell them its for a drive way get something durable and cost effective and worry about saving for the paving process it costs way more than the quick fix i am talking about going with fancy river rock or pea gravel may seem aesthetically pleasing but it wont last you need something durable to make parking easier until you can do something more permanent
DIY,not_removed,agree pea gravel is a bad choice
DIY,not_removed,got it thanks

DIY,not_removed,all depends on what the stencil is so it fits his theme other options might be a door since he has painted just doors or doing it right on the wall my recommendation if possible also buying a banksy is kinda impossible a lot of the towns mark them historical so you could not remove the bricks the few people that have bought a banksy they kinda bought a building and living in it

DIY,not_removed,yea thats fine
DIY,not_removed,solder a linesmans splice with some heatshrink over it
DIY,not_removed,you should buy a cord cap like the one in your example because if your current connection comes loose while the plug is still engaged something is not going to be pleasant
DIY,not_removed,thank you sir ive hooked it up it works as i was pulling in i was told about crimping next project
DIY,not_removed,using a pigtail is fine but they should use the heat shrink wrap over the connection and ideally use crimp connectors
DIY,not_removed,yeah for some stupid reason i was thinking there was already a wire coming off the mirror and op just cut a computer cord and wire nutted it togetherbecause he was contradictory in his example link and what he said if a splice was made as such it is improper and a hazard
DIY,not_removed,and said junction not being contained in a box with some kind of strain relief on the cord can and will pose a shock hazard
DIY,not_removed,second that from the mirrors pdf the led driver is designed to be hung off a wall mounted octagon and judging by images the mirror is independently hung assuming from the twist connector reference there are wires off the led driver crimp splices with heat shrink would be better than that setup still not ideal though

DIY,not_removed,are you completely committed to using bowling balls any way you could reduce the density of the missile im thinking maybe wooden missiles if you lighten up what is going down range then i believe you could use some of the spray foam sprayed into cardboard and have a wall that will stack nicely is durable paintable and repairablereplaceable without undue cost
DIY,not_removed,bowling pins are made of wood rock maple and they stand up to repeated hits by bowling balls well walls made of stacked blocks of or should work but there is still a weight factor to consider
DIY,not_removed,wood
DIY,not_removed,what about sandbags filled something a bit lighter than sand like the stuff used to fill beanbags with though im not sure if you could stack it above waist height

DIY,not_removed,are you completely committed to using bowling balls no i intend to use a few different masssize projectiles i was thinking bowling balls would be the heavy ones perhaps candlepin bowling balls for a lighter one but it has to be something that makes a spectacle when it hits a bean bag wouldnt look like much i did think about using a softball tho that might work or even a sandfilled soccer ball
DIY,not_removed,rock maple is a thing huh but those are pretty slow moving bowling balls
DIY,not_removed,i have been thinking of something beanbagesque but stacking and keeping their shape is a concern yeah also it might actually absorb too much impact and not topple properly

DIY,not_removed,i currently use a projector on a beige wall in a rental things to consider sizeshape of room will you have a straight shot to the wall projector placement shelf mount from ceiling table the windowlight situation can you make the room dark enough the wallscreen white wall should be fine the projector itself io quality etc since you are using cable you would just do an hdmi output from the cable box to the projector my projector has no sound capability so i do hdmi video out and sound out on a separate line to some speakers some projectors can do sound some cant
DIY,not_removed,have you checked the condensation line there is a float in the line that will shut the system down if the line fills with the humidity weve had its working extra hard to get moisture out of the air you should check this every few months since they tend to plug up with algae other than that a refrigerant leak could cause short cycling and the system would shut down are you sure its short cycling or is it jist shutting down side note since you live in fl buy yourself a spare capacitor and learn how to safely change it one hot sunday morning it will go out and youll save yourself the suffering of the heat the expense of a weekend call out and the second call out when they come to remove the bandaid hard start kit and actually replace the capacitor
DIY,not_removed,it sounds to me like you may have a safety switch kicking in the ac starts some condition causes a safety to trip the safety switch essentially kills the low voltage which shuts off both the compressor and the thermostat after being off for a few minutes the safety resets and the compressor and thermostat come back on
DIY,not_removed,sounds similar to mine had a old compressor over that would trip the breaker which the thermostat was on so the thermostat would power off the fan unit is on a different breaker than the ac so once tripped the fan would continue but was not cool air ended up replacing it this summer not a hvac person at all to give you ideas i called a company and they told me compressor was bad and would continue to trip the breaker
DIY,not_removed,maybe an obvious question but do you have a battery powered thermostat which btw i hate if you do have you checkedchanged the batteries
DIY,not_removed,i bet your capacitor is going out
DIY,not_removed,you live in florida so you have a heat pump when it runs for a few minutes is it cold or hot if it is hot i bet your switching valve is stuck you might be able to bang it with a wrench and get it to swap back
DIY,not_removed,your thermostat should be receiving power from a transformer inside your furnace depending on the age of your furnace it may come from a circuit board instead you may want to check all connections dealing with thermostat wire and make sure they are tight
DIY,not_removed,your thermostat receives power separate from the ac not sure what you mean by its shutting off the power
DIY,not_removed,its just shutting down as in the thermostat goes blank like it lost power i will have to look up to check how to check a condensation line i dont quite know what that is
DIY,not_removed,in case you havent found it or for anyone who runs across this the most common set up i see in fl will have the float valve within about of the indoor unit and uses this style of if you lift the switch out of the pipe and see water a plugged condensation line is your problem the easiest way to clear this is with a shop vac from outside find where the drain line exits the house usually near the outdoor unit put the shop vac hose on the line and wrap a towel around the drain line to improve the vacuum after its clear pour a little white vinegar through the drain from inside the house where you removed the switch

DIY,not_removed,for a possible cheap alternative maybe try twothree command hooks set in a horizontal line but spaced out so you can set the book on it youll need something to hold the top of the book back so maybe museum putty if not you can do a cheap simple shelf with two l brackets and a piece of wood
DIY,not_removed,would fit your needs of them were you looking for more of a formal look you could also get and mount them upside down
DIY,not_removed,a picture frame shelf ikea has a bunch heres one at target

DIY,not_removed,thank you
DIY,not_removed,thanks
DIY,not_removed,in fact i was making it with guard etc good friend of mine just got in touch hes a carpenter and did this himself works with it regularly gave me tips
DIY,not_removed,all that work cant be easier or cheaper than buying a table saw
DIY,not_removed,theres no right answer as workbenches tend to be built to suit the users need so my first piece of advice would be to build it in a way that makes sense for your use as for the question about the osb it is available waterproofed wherever you are getting it from should be able to tell you if it is or isnt waterproofed the truth is that all osb has some water resistant characteristics but being exposed to high humidity id go with the waterproofed versions for sure whether you get it prewaterproofed or just normal you can buy sealant or waterproofing liquid not sure if your local place carries it but if you look for it online youll find that there are a lot of options out there for just about any price range the only other small bit of advice i would add is to consider casters wheels for the bottom of the legs if you plan to move the workbenches or separate thembring them together very often then attaching a good quality locking caster is a must itll make moving the benches much easier
DIY,not_removed,whenever i do something like this i always spend some time in advance dreaming it up take and imagine yourself using it and try to picture what you would do i did this and ended up with what was basically a very sturdy dolly with locked wheels so that it only moved in directions and had layers to it the bottom section we put the circular saw speed square and extension cord the middle had things like screws a screw driver and clamps while the top stayed clean for quick use we didnt need it to collapse and it would very easily cart into and out of position as we needed it so it basically just stays at our shop as boomer already mentioned there is no good answer for you but i would certainly look into making it water proof nothing like spending hours on something to make it just perfect and then having it break down on you when you need it most
DIY,not_removed,does your country have storeswarehouses that recycle materials from building that have been torn down or rehabbed in the us we have recyclereuse it stores called habitat for humanity they sell used doors cabinets furniture etc to finance their organization if you have something similar do not use new material get some desks and cabinetry and make your workbenches out of recycled wood saves you money and it will exercise your creativity
DIY,not_removed,consider particle board flooring yellow tongue for your top rather than osb its treated to deal with rain so humidity should be fine its thicker and flatter than osb osb is designed for bracing flooring is designed for walking on better for a bench ive had a bench top made out of yellow tongue for a couple years and ive been happy with it
DIY,not_removed,ah yes casters almost forgot about them thanks
DIY,not_removed,looked into our local habitat for humanity and it has httpstoresebaycomsghabitatsingaporerestore thats a good point though ill spend some time searching around
DIY,not_removed,maybe they have more but the manager for their estore has failed in his duties good hunting

DIY,not_removed,leaded paint do not touch
DIY,not_removed,if anyone knows of a product that sort of melts or smooths out old paint which i would then just paint over no such thing if you dont want to strip why not make exact replacements for them and install them
DIY,not_removed,call your local milllumber supplier ask them if they can mill new baseboards take off take it down and get a quote take your time
DIY,not_removed,goto home depot buy a piece of finishing board like inches for the front and then a inch for the top something like this i did them and it looks great
DIY,not_removed,other than jasco which is for removalno no such thing
DIY,not_removed,you could try using caulking to smooth out the edges of the rough areas we have lots of old probably lead paint in our house if sanding is required i take it outside and use a good respirator and goggles
DIY,not_removed,wetsanding is also helpful to keep airborne particulates out of you
DIY,not_removed,looks like a nice table but i dont think its considered mid century style is it
DIY,not_removed,fuckin eh that is beautiful man this looks more like modernindustrial but good job you got me more excited to learn to weld
DIY,not_removed,so do you watch two tvs
DIY,not_removed,i like your magnetic upvotes
DIY,not_removed,nice table now its time to upgrade those tvs
DIY,not_removed,looks great what kind of wood did you use and which stain color
DIY,not_removed,dope but could use some rgb
DIY,not_removed,this is perfect can you make me one
DIY,not_removed,what bulb do you have in that lamp
DIY,not_removed,thanks you could be right but i just googled mcm table steel wood and came up pretty high in the results maybe my proportions arent correct but thats the style i was aiming for
DIY,not_removed,yeah i wouldnt have thought it was specifically midcentury but i like it either way how did you make sure the top surface was good and flat
DIY,not_removed,sometimes its usually sportsrelated or sometimes well play a game on one and watch tv on the other
DIY,not_removed,thanks was the stain i used was the poly i should have used poplar but i accidentally picked out maple which is like more expensive by the time i got to the register i was too lazy to replace it since id already spent time picking out good boards
DIY,not_removed,just a regular watt cfl
DIY,not_removed,the biscuit joiner did most of the work of aligning them i also adjusted the boards by hand after i clamped them and sanding any rough joints after it was cut to size did the rest
DIY,not_removed,ok cheershappily i just bought myself a biscuit jointer last week

DIY,not_removed,dude no need to fix it this looks dirty and shitty as fuck you should start it all by cleaning the whole thing
DIY,not_removed,without knowing what the rest of that space looks like its hard to give you all your options but here are a couple of thoughts pull out the sink and swap out the vanity for something from a garage sale youll lose the white tile that one probably has a lot of rot still in it so it might save you hassle down the road pull out everything up to the right side of the sink close off the adjacent cabinets with a piece of ply then either build a basic box for the sink or buy a cheap wall mount or pedestal sink depends on if you need the space underneath carve out a space for a at the front clean everything real good fill in the gap with foam or caulk maybe use a to get the in their flush repaint
DIY,not_removed,first no second no third no good chance you dont own it again no this is not a diy project you have no ability to turn off the power
DIY,not_removed,yeah just dig it up and duct tape it to your house
DIY,not_removed,would it make any sense to put a shed or gazebo in that part of your yard
DIY,not_removed,lmao love it
DIY,not_removed,probably not too good dont touch your face after touching anything thats for sure

DIY,not_removed,you will need to install a back flow preventer to prevent any water from the field to enter the house through the hose spigot or however you attach it this would be a very similar setup to an underground sprinkler setup been in that business for years or so you will also need a method to remove the water from the underground pipe as well as the riser pipe on both ends to prevent freezing in the winter i do not recommend using a garden hose for this however they do make a flexible black poly pipe for underground sprinklers that you can sleeve with the pvc to protect it from rocks as you tunnel under the sidewalk patio or any other concrete surface as for removing the water in the winter time typically we used compressed air for this the air simply blows out the water on the other end leaving the pipe empty or at least mostly empty also if you sleeve the poly pipe and there is a break in the middle somewhere the water will only come out on the end of the sleeve thus protecting the patio pavers sidewalk etc from underground water erosion you wont know exactly where the break is but then again it does not matter just dig up both ends pull out the old pipe and run a new pipe in its place since the sleeve is already buried the path should be clear and the run easy think of a tunnel
DIY,not_removed,why wouldnt you just run the water through a pvc pipe underground and then attach the hose to it on the other end if youre in an area that freezes youll want to bury it below the frost layer
DIY,not_removed,get a roll of flexible pvc used for irrigation its more sturdy and likely cheaper at the end near the house get a y connector for your spigot and connect one side to the pvc using the correct garden hose fittings and the other side of the y can be used for a hose there at the other end of the pvc add a shut off valve yes if you dont want to turn off the spigot at the house then the water will be in it all the time not a big deal be sure to disconnect and drain it as best you can if you are in an area that has winters
DIY,not_removed,several people are recommending flexible pvc which is really unnecessary the proper way to do this is to tap off your water feed to your spout with copper pipe run the copper underground end with another spout this allows you to have pressure on the line at all times same as your current spout is now and how your sprinkler system is from your house water supply to the valves running copper may seem complex but learning to solder with a torch is quite easy if you really dont want to use copper you can use regular pvc schedule its incredibly easy to use it all glues together all the fittings can be found at your hardware store but place a shut off valve at the supply side so you can cut water to the pvc if it ever leaks the point is do not use hose you need ridged plumbing for underground applications copper is choice of you wanted water pressure at your end tap at all times
DIY,not_removed,thanks for all the advice someone above mentioned that i need to bury the pvc below the frost layer according to my research ohios is i looked on a couple of rental websites for trenchers but all of them advertise as any ideas on how to get inches deeper after using the trenchers i imagine i could use a shovel but im not sure how it would work exactly since the slit into the ground would be so thin
DIY,not_removed,dont know much about piping or plumbing so i wasnt sure what i would need to use is there specific pvc piping for this type of job also should i be using just the screw in extenders or do i need to put some type of epoxy on the extenders and piping of each connection
DIY,not_removed,the flexible pvc seems to be the common suggestion here thanks for the advice
DIY,not_removed,if you plan to winterize then you dont need to go below the frost line inches is sufficient if you plan to leave it full of water all year round then you need to go below the frost line however you also have to consider the risers as they will be above the frost line all the time if you attach it to a adapter on your spigot at the house you have that part to worry about also the riser at the far end with the spigot there you need a method to remove the water or keep both ends also frost free i would plan it like a sprinkler system if you want to leave water on to it all the time except the winter then you are limited in your choices of back flow preventers sometimes referred to as anti siphon valves some only work when there is no up stream pressure ie the water is turned off at the source some will work with upstream pressure but they are considerably larger and more costly look up watts back flow preventer
DIY,not_removed,go to your local hardware store and request flexible pvc pipe typically used for irrigation systems you dont need to run your hose inside the pipe i wouldnt run garden hose down into the ground to the pipe no matter how strong you think the hose is the hose isnt designed for that purpose run the pvc right up out of the ground and fasten into your hose bib with a backflow preventer again you may have to do some searching around at a hardware store for the specific fittings to meet your needs bury the pipe below frost level and then some dont know where you live but my area is inches if you want added protection put of blue rigid insulation wide centred over the pipe as you bury it youll need to blow the whole system out prior to the winter months i have no recommendation for doing this other than to get someone in who knows what theyre doing
DIY,not_removed,the wall doesnt have studs behind it
DIY,not_removed,dont do this just get some drywall anchors or better yet something thats designed to hold a mirror

DIY,not_removed,you have two different woods you can buy a solid stain meaning you dont see through it like you would with a transparent stain here are some samples from hd but look around this is just the first thing that comes up
DIY,not_removed,looks like two different woods pressure treated pine and cedar would be my guess no stain will make them match your better off with a deck paint that completely covers everything
DIY,not_removed,those will never match unless you paint them
DIY,not_removed,since stain is translucent you can put more coats on one side than the other to make one darker and match the colors keep in mind though if you add something like a sealer that could alter the color and throw your match
DIY,not_removed,dont power wash decks use a wood cleaning prep product might even want to use a stripper now before you stain the deck put a piece of duct tape down and pull it up if theres wood fibers on the back the pressure washing has damaged the wood and you need to clean that off before stain is applied to answer your original question use a solid color stain or a super solid product with texture if you want to fill gaps or anything
DIY,not_removed,sand both down and reseal with a new stain treatment
DIY,not_removed,a semisolid stain will give you good depth while still leaving some of the grain remaining naturally solid stain would look like a paint but would also do the trick semitransparent stains may do well enough to hide the differences but less likely
DIY,not_removed,by vents i assume you mean ducts well this is actually one of the easier diy projects so i would tell them no and then do it yourself it is a good idea to insulate your ducts but you can do it yourself for less than half that probably i have insulated some ducts in my home but i was able to use some insulation that was left from the previous homeowner but even if you have to buy it itll still be cheaper in the attic it does not need to be pretty either as long as its functionally correct oh and foil is better for attic spaces you can get plastic wrapped but it tends to break down in the heat of an attic
DIY,not_removed,if the product they want to apply is the stuff thats basically bubble wrap with a foil layer on either side then its essentially useless unless installed in a very specific manner the manufacturers of that stuff get that number by testing an assembly and installation method which spaces the insulation material away from the actual duct about inch for the full length of the duct run through the use of spacer rings between the duct and the insulation this turns out to be very laborintensive in practice and especially difficult to do if there is any existing insulation on the ductwork so almost no one actually installs this way if the bubble wrap is just wrapped tight around the duct it performs much worse than like somewhere around rendering it an expensive waste of time much more cost and labor efficient to simply put on the thickest fiberglass insulation wrap you can get your hands on

DIY,not_removed,ha no you probably dont even need a new hvac
DIY,not_removed,yes i meant ducts sorry i also figured it was quite high for what they were doing
DIY,not_removed,i believe thats the product the installer didnt seem to push too hard when i said i wasnt interested so i suspect hes only pushing it because hes required to
DIY,not_removed,i agree the current system works but its a bit under powered for the house a new heatercoolinghot water heater insulation for paid at a month for the next years seemed reasonable a good part of that will likely be made up in energy savings
DIY,not_removed,make sure the shut off valve on the hot water line is open all the way
DIY,not_removed,flush the hot line and check the new ones filters anytime you disconnectreconnect a water line always flush the lines before hooking them back up always
DIY,not_removed,could be air in the system ya
DIY,not_removed,i just replaced a bathroom faucet today make sure you flush it with the aerator off if that doesnt clear things out and youve checked everything else everyone mentioned you may have to take it apart to find the obstruction instructions are usually included with the faucet if youre not comfortable doing that id suggest returning it for another faucet sometimes its just easier and faster to get a replacement than it is to tear it down and put it back together

DIY,not_removed,how do i do that
DIY,not_removed,what is the aerator
DIY,not_removed,
DIY,not_removed,thanks for jumping in on that
DIY,not_removed,ywelcome theyre actual purpose is to slow the water coming out of the faucet to prevent splashing its screen that performs this also serving added benefit in collecting any tiny solids in the water so yes they do get clogged from solids but mostly from mineral deposits such as iron andor calcium leeching out of the water easy to take off to then backflush to clear out the screen i use pliers with a rag wrapped around the aerator to prevent scratching its chrome or whatever finish is on it often cold water will have better pressure than hot water for it does not have to go thru the xtra length bends that a water heater naturally has that slows the water down but mostly sooner than the cold side hot water tends to leech out those minerals and depositing inside the pipes thus restricting its flow it should not be an extreme variance between the hot cold so somethings going on if is have you found the remedy for yours
DIY,not_removed,op im sorry to tell you but theres a reason why storebought gates have vertical bars only your horizontal bars are pretty good footrests your adorable child is going to climb over that gate in no time other than that it looks really good
DIY,not_removed,it looks nice although the kid must not be that old yet or else all that stuff on the railing part would have been knocked over
DIY,not_removed,very nice and i like the shelving as well as a kid however that wouldve looked to me like one big jungle gym
DIY,not_removed,looks nice but i imagine a baby can crawl through that bottom triangular hole
DIY,not_removed,paint that damn wall piece
DIY,not_removed,nice gate the youngster looks like hes there to drink juice and fuck shit up and hes all out of juice
DIY,not_removed,im only seeing negative comments on here this is beautiful great job it would make a really nice doggy gate
DIY,not_removed,but its not made to meet the safety standards that came put today s
DIY,not_removed,nice
DIY,not_removed,i want one for my dog i cant stand the tension piece of crap we have now
DIY,not_removed,looks awesome how did you mount it to the wall and how does it clasp shut
DIY,not_removed,httpsyoutubehdocruteuqlistrdhdocruteuq
DIY,not_removed,my month old can open any door good luck with that
DIY,not_removed,sweet gate i cant wait to make a similar one for my own child one day
DIY,not_removed,beautifully done
DIY,not_removed,that looks great
DIY,not_removed,thats a nice baby gate
DIY,not_removed,awesome
DIY,not_removed,aesthetically this looks great realistically a solid gate would probably work out better long term i like it though i feel like this should be a standard option on staircases tbh perhaps you could fix the climbing problem with some plexiglass on the side facing away from the stairs just make sure theres no sharp edges
DIY,not_removed,annnnd hes too old to need it anymore just kidding very nice
DIY,not_removed,looking forward to the pictures thank you for the explanation
DIY,not_removed,i first read this wanted to make a baby for a while store bought one broke and was thoroughly confused for a moment
DIY,not_removed,it would be cool for a dog you should take note that the triangle at the side of the stairs is a very dangerous choking hazard kid sticks head in slide down and now its stuck
DIY,not_removed,i remember sliding down the stairs on my ass as a child we would race who could do it faster such happy memories i still miss those happier times
DIY,not_removed,lol when i clicked on this my brain had elided the word gate from the title i was super interested to see what the store bought baby looked like how it was broken and a slide show of how you made one from scratch still a nice if a little flawed gate design
DIY,not_removed,its really pretty reminds me of something id see on hgtv as a custom piece it is a little impractical for climbing babies but for pets it would be effective
DIY,not_removed,why would a store buy a broken gate
DIY,not_removed,nice gate gorey title
DIY,not_removed,why is nobody talking about the classic craftsman bandsaw with original cast iron stovepipe stand
DIY,not_removed,beautiful work man impractical for what it is but very nice
DIY,not_removed,damn guess you built a baby latter get some climbing baby photos and update us with your new one oh and btw i love the shelves a lot
DIY,not_removed,super pretty you did a great job very creative
DIY,not_removed,may want to hide your license plate
DIY,not_removed,very attractive and well put together both the gate and the toddler
DIY,not_removed,an easily climbable probably openable smash a hole into your wallable baby gate at the bottom of the stairs
DIY,not_removed,ill be honest i read this and thought you wanted to make a scandal about a baby
DIY,not_removed,this may sound nitpicky but you should either put just on handle on the opposite side or use a different kind of latch all together by the time the kid can stand on tiptoes hell figure out how to open it
DIY,not_removed,the gate looks pretty cool but sooner or later the baby can easily climb through hope you can change for a vertical one just for safety reason
DIY,not_removed,you need to put a door stop somewhere to stop it from swinging out from personal experience door handles can cause a lot of damage
DIY,not_removed,nice ladder waste of time
DIY,not_removed,im deeply saddened everytime i read a title along the lines of i thought id give this a shot and then i see a pretty decent woodshop in the pictures
DIY,not_removed,so it catches kids when they fall down the stairs
DIY,not_removed,store bought one broke do decided to give it a shot
DIY,not_removed,hey is there a tool for doing those pocket screw holes i feel like trying to free hand those i would just mangle the wood
DIY,not_removed,deleted
DIY,not_removed,lol you made a ladder sweet
DIY,not_removed,looks awesome is that shelving to code for a rail i thought that spacing had to be closer together so that a small child couldnt get through or get stuck while trying to get through hopefully you dont have to redo it all since you are selling soon
DIY,not_removed,am i the only one to see a svastika
DIY,not_removed,came here to say this my would be over this first attempt but it is damn pretty
DIY,not_removed,thank you i definitely see the design flaw but we are listing the house soon so it should work in the meantime it will make a much better dog gate than a baby gate lol
DIY,not_removed,ha theyre vertical so its easy to wrap the barbed wire around sorry just kidding had to say it nice build anyway op btw i bought an old wooden one at a thrift store for my grandkids better than could be bought at any store strong excellent operation and it cost
DIY,not_removed,just add some of those little spikes used to keep birds from perching and youre set
DIY,not_removed,yeah my toddler would climb that in no time
DIY,not_removed,based on the shelving going up the stairs this problem exists regardless
DIY,not_removed,agreed same reason you dont see horizontal members in cribs
DIY,not_removed,the pinch hinge isnt a great feature either i always discourage people to make their own gate there is a reason there are certifications for it
DIY,not_removed,hes almost two the year old tho has knocked things over on many occasions
DIY,not_removed,he likely could luckily in almost two years now he hasnt tried too many other things to keep him distracted i guess
DIY,not_removed,it will be painted this evening i have to wait for him to fall asleep so i can leave the gate open
DIY,not_removed,back to the drawing board
DIY,not_removed,thank you i have a piece of on each side of the gate and have two door hinges holding it on to latch it i have a spring loaded ball bearing where the striker would normally be for the handle and then a sliding lock on the back side where the little one cant reach it but the year old can get up and down the stairs on his own
DIY,not_removed,runexpected
DIY,not_removed,and climb over that in three seconds
DIY,not_removed,lmao
DIY,not_removed,right i had posted a few weeks ago about it and the craftsman table saw i picked up but it went mostly unnoticed i havent gotten to use it yet tho i need to pick up a rpm motor and a blade
DIY,not_removed,ive never understood why hiding a license plate matters
DIY,not_removed,its a lease so its not registered to me thank you for the heads up tho didnt realize it was even in the photo
DIY,not_removed,thank you
DIY,not_removed,its to keep him from going up if i put it at the top he could climb all the way up and just to fall down one less step if he never goes up them then he cant fall down them
DIY,not_removed,i loved that tim minchin song too
DIY,not_removed,doesnt sound that way at all handle isnt functionali have a bearing pressure latch in the striker hole and then a slide lock on the back side planned originally to do only a deadbolt there but found out the latch was too long after drilling the hole
DIY,not_removed,im ron burgundy
DIY,not_removed,correct i split a down to and attached that to the wall there is plated with wood slats behind the drywall in my house so i did hit some wood in your case i would do the same with the trim and attach it using anchor screws this spreads the strain out across the board instead of all at the hinge points on the softer drywall
DIY,not_removed,dont know if op used one but kreg makes a good pocket hole jig i had a cheaper one it didnt last and broke quickly this one will last
DIY,not_removed,ubrocklee posted what i used its the pocket kreg jig worth every penny one of my new favorite tools
DIY,not_removed,thank you ours isnt a climber yet he likes getting into things but hasnt shown interest in the shelving maybe since its just always been there and hes never seen anyone do it i could gaurantee if his big brother did it once he would never stop trying to do it too
DIY,not_removed,no it isnt code is usually nothing larger than can pass though a spindle space and they need to be a minimum of thick
DIY,not_removed,i cant take credit for the shelving it was there when we bought and passed city inspectors ive seen houses with wide open sides and a railing on the other so im sure its based on your local codes the only code i was told of was the requirement of a hand rail on one side
DIY,not_removed,you should google what a swastika looks like
DIY,not_removed,i keep hearing about this guy link sounds interestin
DIY,not_removed,nope
DIY,not_removed,youd be shocked at how well a dog can climb too especially when the gate is nice and sturdy like that
DIY,not_removed,put spikes on it
DIY,not_removed,our baby dachshund could leap over the dog gate that was taller than she was long like a doped up pole vaulter
DIY,not_removed,dogs understand horizontal rungs too it looks very nice though matches the aesthetic you already have going perfectly
DIY,not_removed,fill the holes with some foam blocks or something paint to match color scheme
DIY,not_removed,folks just forget that when the kid gets to the top theyll start creating a scene and you will find them good job
DIY,not_removed,and he cant undo whatever lock you chose in the first minutes
DIY,not_removed,so you are really relying on luck for it to work then if my childs safety were the issue i wouldnt rely on luck just sayin
DIY,not_removed,literally the most interesting part of the install you dont show or describe in the album
DIY,not_removed,if you are in salt lake i have one from the same era
DIY,not_removed,if someone really wanted to they could run the plates and get personal info likely not the way most people run scams anymore tho as there are many other options that offer more info for less work
DIY,not_removed,why wouldnt a lease be registered to you
DIY,not_removed,then perfect great foresight and looks good
DIY,not_removed,hey awesome thanks for replying
DIY,not_removed,yeah if they want it removed it will only take minutes and youll never know it was there based on the size of the house the next owners will likely have kids as well tho
DIY,not_removed,holes are pretty easy to patch up
DIY,not_removed,they might see it as a feature
DIY,not_removed,theres probably holes drilled all over the house
DIY,not_removed,lol
DIY,not_removed,i bought a house two years ago and i can tell you that a few small holes like that was the least of my worry we also had planned to repaint the whole house anyway because the previous owners had no taste
DIY,not_removed,maybe they used the holes of the old gate that broke id certainly hope so considering that the way this is constructed allowed him to put the hinges anywhere
DIY,not_removed,its strategically placed
DIY,not_removed,yup parenting just hope theyre lucky s in all seriousness im actually a slightly over protective parent and i know and raise my kids well if i thought it would be an issue i wouldnt put it in and if it starts to become an issue i have no problem removing it
DIY,not_removed,yeah i need pics of this locking mechanism ive got a crappy eye hook lock on my diy dog gate looking to upgrade
DIY,not_removed,ill take pictures when i get home from work tonight and post them didnt think to take any before
DIY,not_removed,i wish i was im in the midwest
DIY,not_removed,thanks
DIY,not_removed,because its leased from the dealership op doesnt own it so its not registered
DIY,not_removed,a spiral is not a swastika there is no cross member in the centre
DIY,not_removed,even if its only temporary its nice to see this pretty gate added to the house i like how it worked well with the shelving and it shows that you can do pretty wood work
DIY,not_removed,it bothers me that you didnt paint the wall piece
DIY,not_removed,you only need baby gates for years though
DIY,not_removed,guys guys just let the man justify himself
DIY,not_removed,only if they have a baby
DIY,not_removed,the horror
DIY,not_removed,then remove it and fix it
DIY,not_removed,its not bad
DIY,not_removed,ukmatthewj
DIY,not_removed,thank you i came to the comments section specifically to see who else was urked by this
DIY,not_removed,it will be painted this evening when the little one falls asleep
DIY,not_removed,only if they have a small dog two of my kids were climbers they would have been able to climb over that before they could walk this gate is an accident waiting to happen
DIY,not_removed,til that redditors are apparently all helicopter parents and catastrophizers
DIY,not_removed,you look at for a map
DIY,not_removed,i understand it well when leasing a vehicle the car is registered to the lender with the lessor as a secondary registrant this is because they own it and youre renting it from them with a little extra digging you could likely get my name and address from it but the tools most people would use would come back with vw credit as the registered owner source i run the dealership i leased it from
DIY,not_removed,maybe theres different leasing laws from state to state we dont get the license plate sticker on our birthday like with a regular purchase and the registration is in the leasing companys name with the leasee having additional documentation this seems to be the case with op too
DIY,not_removed,if ops moving soon maybe the lease is nearly up
DIY,not_removed,i dont think you understand there are multiple types of leasing p
DIY,not_removed,irked sorry i was irked by that
DIY,not_removed,my ocd feels a little better thanks
DIY,not_removed,if you arent familiar with the kids abilities it wouldnt be wise to just send them down stairs without caution but a coordinated year old who is aware of how to use stairs and a railing safely is no big risk
DIY,not_removed,seriously ive never known a year old that cant do stairs easily i am a paranoid helicopter crazystrict parent but seriously by kids are doing stairs and by its a mastered skill
DIY,not_removed,by three if they cant do stairs by themselves you have a developmental problem
DIY,not_removed,at least the gate will break the babys fall on the way down im a terrible person
DIY,not_removed,at least in not an idiot that builds a ladder instead of a gate
DIY,not_removed,yea true
DIY,not_removed,not sure i have never tried it
DIY,not_removed,we dont believe you post a photo of the registration for proof youll also need to post your proof of insurance drivers license social security card credit cards and pins blood type mothers maiden name and favorite flavor of gelato
DIY,not_removed,thats weird in ny im pretty sure it get registered to the person the title stays in the name of the lease company though
DIY,not_removed,apparently not
DIY,not_removed,maybe i identify as an orc
DIY,not_removed,exactly and year olds do stairs
DIY,not_removed,honest question will falling down a possible maximum of steps and slamming into a wooden gate at the bottom make much of a difference vs falling one more step and slamming into the wooden floor
DIY,not_removed,because it takes an idiot to do it wtf is wrong with you do you even have children i dont know you at all but from just these few posts i can tell you are the type that needs to put others down to feel better about yourself i would suggest you start to worry more about your personal issues than you do my children
DIY,not_removed,give a man a fish feed him for a day teach a man how to fish feed him for a lifetime maybe op is an idiot but he needs to figure that out on his own also if you dont have anything nice to say its better to say nothing at all calling people idiots is not going to get you far in life
DIY,not_removed,you looked at the stars
DIY,not_removed,all of that is on the same piece of paper that has my best friends last name and my high school mascot is it still useful to you
DIY,not_removed,yeah im sure it varies by state i can only attest to illinois and missouri
DIY,not_removed,iirc developmental psychology studies have show that children at or have learned the locomotion affordances for precipices this then activates their problem solving module to explore locomotion possibilities cautiously
DIY,not_removed,im going to take a stab at it you dont have a or year old what are you going to do move the gate and hold their hand every time they want to go down the stairs thats bubblewrap level of overprotective if you know your kid can be safe on your stairs you take a small risk by letting them go up or down as they need to you take risks every time you let them sit in a chair play on a playground or let them ride in a car its not great for a child to see that you have zero confidence in their ability to handle things for themselves if you have a clumsy uncoordinated accidentprone kid different story
DIY,not_removed,this is what happens when you dont teach your kids to do stairs
DIY,not_removed,how old is your daughter i mean only you can judge your own situation and your childs abilities but from what youve said id guess she is not at the age were talking about i think youll see drastic confidence and ability improvement by or dont baby her when shes not a baby any longer parenting isnt synonymous with eliminating all risks
DIY,not_removed,honest answer no but i have a feeling that falling down steps would be a bad time
DIY,not_removed,heh then dont post on rdiy if you cant take criticism poor guy im not the only one pointing out a shitty design you said if it was a problem you would take it down to fix it i merely encouraged it sounds like you now realize you fucked up
DIY,not_removed,doing just fine in life thank you very much
DIY,not_removed,perfect were waiting
DIY,not_removed,my sister tripped on stairs and split her head open she was at the time and no where near as clumsy as i was accidents happen and some parents feel its better to be safe than sorry
DIY,not_removed,as someone who has personally fallen down every one of those steps pictured i can confirm this is true happened first month in the house coming down the steps in socks and foot slipped off the edge and down i went
DIY,not_removed,i have no issue taking criticism but calling some one an idiot is a little much based on your post history it looks like you are the last person who should be offering advice about parenting
DIY,not_removed,my wife has eaten shit on the main stairs and ive eaten it on the basement stairs idk who these people are saying age and stairs are safe were like and apparently havent figured it out yet
DIY,not_removed,i honestly hate stairs ive fallen down the stairs a lot and so has my oldest my middle kid rolled from top to steps onto tile because the gate at the top of the stairs accidentally got propped open my friend in the same housing plan broke her foot tripping down four stairs i hate stairs they are death traps
DIY,not_removed,is there anything else around your building that could be hosting water buildup of leaves or debris
DIY,not_removed,you need to make sure that your french drain is below your basement floor but above the footing if you place the drain higher than your slab you will very likely increase the water infiltrations that you are currently experiencing if you install the drain lower than the bottom of the foundations you can cause an erosion and undermine the foundations normally there is a sweet spot where you are under the slab and over the bottom of the footing you should also make sure that your slab is level or at least that your drain is lower than the lowest point
DIY,not_removed,there is a downspout but its routed out past the sidewalk the slope is incorrect so were fixing that after the drain is installed there was some honeycombs in the basement walls i used zypex to plug and patch gutters are clean and grass is mowed and everything is picked up
DIY,not_removed,are you looking for advice on the materials for the date signs or on how to attach them the velcro should work well id recommend sewing it on rather than just relying on the adhesive backing for the dates could you get some made up from the same place you got the sign

DIY,not_removed,any metal file will work fine youll be surprised how quickly they can remove material if you want a power tool an angle grinder with a flap wheel will smooth it right out
DIY,not_removed,not sure how rough it is but even sand paper would deburr it
DIY,not_removed,angle grinder how did you cut it if using a torch set and clamp another piece of steel as a guide much better cut than freehand
DIY,not_removed,a grinder with a flapper disc buffing disc

DIY,not_removed,thanks it is x so not too big assuming you could borrow an angle grinder or metal file which would you use
DIY,not_removed,beat me by seconds
DIY,not_removed,thanks it was some scrap cut for me so honestly i am not sure how it was cut
DIY,not_removed,with zero experience and nothing to practice on id use a file if you have someone who can show you basic safety for an angle grinder some protective equipment and somewhere safe to use it its gonna throw off showers of sparks itll be a bit quicker and power tools are more fun of course
DIY,not_removed,are the edges flared and discolored thats flame cut if the edges are just burred thats likely saw cut a waterjet on that thickness would probably be a mostly clean cut but with some fine waviness along the side clamp that sucker to a table grab the biggest file in the shop knock off the big snags by filing in the direction of the long axis of the file how you normally think of filing then draw the file along the edge perpendicular to the long axis of the file this will leave a fine smooth edge youtube has a bunch of videos on how to draw file i learned it from a toolmaker who could draw file to a tolerance of less than one thousandth of an inch that process is more involved than what you need to debur an edge but it gives you the idea of whats possible
DIY,not_removed,good point i had not thought about messing it up without having something to practice on thanks
DIY,not_removed,
DIY,not_removed,really hoping its not under the moulding like
DIY,not_removed,i have the exact same post in my house and its loose in exactly the same spot
DIY,not_removed,i was wondering about the air flow wouldnt it be better to reverse it all and make it go upwards take advantage of natural convection otherwise very cool idea whats the total cost
DIY,not_removed,how about vibration and shock isolation for the drives perhaps adding rubber washers between the nuts on there shims im on mobile do i didnt read that in your descriptions looks really good overall
DIY,not_removed,its nice and simple but i urge you to not keep your drives like this in those brackets get yourself some which will both isolate your drives and allow you to swap them out a lot more easily as well as keep them cooler your current setup is a awful for hard drive vibration which can cause premature drive failure as they are all vibrating together and thus add up
DIY,not_removed,make sure youve grounded each component the nice thing about aluminium cases is that they provide a path to ground for your motherboard and spinning drives when you make a case out of wood it may be necessary to incorporate ground wires into your build
DIY,not_removed,not bad interesting setup although i personally would probably not go this route as addingswappingupgrading parts might become a bit of a pain one thing this taught me though is the power cable fabrication does it introduce any issues when you have so many hdds on a single line i remember power issues with ide drives back in the day couldnt have on a single line in some cases but that might have been related more to the psu wattage also are the hdds tied into the rack in any way or are they just sitting on the rubber insulators how much noise are you getting from them in other words is it noticeable
DIY,not_removed,i submitted an earlier version of this project to i will incorporate the suggested additions dust filtering rearrangement of the air circulation in a touch up later any ideas on improvement or changes are very welcome
DIY,not_removed,if you dont mind what was the total cost of this project
DIY,not_removed,i take it you stream a lot of hd video how well does it work
DIY,not_removed,shouldnt you make the mounting brackets have rounded edges or slightly truncated so you dont reach in one day and cut yourself on the corners
DIY,not_removed,what raid setup are you using
DIY,not_removed,rhomelab
DIY,not_removed,im another one whos skeptical of the air flow in there this is thick wood that doesnt conduct heat very well i also recommend putting a filter on the intake another option might be to ditch the back which no one will see and replace it with a perforated metal sheet looking at the hardware youre using you probably wont be hurting the life of any of the components due to heat anyway still youve got a power supply and processor in there that generate a bunch of heat id probably prefer a perforated metal sheet over any fans for airflow i also would prefer hot swappable cages now that you have the lid on it doesnt look like fun to add or remove disks which will fail at some point
DIY,not_removed,hey im always down to make something neat and tinker around but why would you just not put a server in a case
DIY,not_removed,what is a nas server
DIY,not_removed,that my friend is some damned impressive work well done
DIY,not_removed,im sorry as im not really beyond basic computer stuff but what does this do
DIY,not_removed,next time you want a small power supply look for an sfx power supply i have a sfx psu from corsair which i find amazing you can also get it in a config from corsair
DIY,not_removed,can i ask why you want hot air to cool your power supply
DIY,not_removed,how much did you pay for those reds
DIY,not_removed,as much as i can see your creativity i would error on caution here or just go back to a regular enclosure you are clearly ignoring several important factors here that other companies put into their rd ages ago one of which is airflow as others mentioned the next is electrical grounding as wood is very bad for conductivity and static charge the next is the fact that these drives are not designed to be squeeze mounted they have very specific mounting points the next is vibration the mount is not stable enough sure it works but not like what you think it should i can predict multiple drive failures in the very near future before warranty expires
DIY,not_removed,if the temp is an issue look into this i am actually installing one this weekend in my server closet home lab ac infinity airplate quiet cooling fan system with thermostat control for home theater av cabinets
DIY,not_removed,motherboard
DIY,not_removed,what is a nas server like i understand what a server is ive just not ever heard of nas
DIY,not_removed,i will rework the airflow in the future i will probably make it run from right to left or vice versa on each level the current layout is not optimal and the temperatures are a little above where they should be currently °c ° less would be the goal
DIY,not_removed,the only reason i could see to have it move against convection is to get cold air blowing over the board rather than hotter air not sure how much it would really matter though for something like this
DIY,not_removed,that was my question too and its often overlooked ideally youd isolate each drive separately but thats overengineering it speaking of subtle things to overengineer what about electrical interference between power and data cables i dont know what the spec says in this case off the top of my head
DIY,not_removed,my nas has two drives sitting upside down in the bottom of my case using a sock beneath them as vibration dampener temps are just fine slightly on the high side but certainly nothing they arent built to handle and i havent had a single problem in the years ive used this setup not everything needs to be engineered to death certainly not when it costs as much as your proposal if a cage were say then sure that makes sense but and its not even enough to fit all the hard drives in so youd need a second hahahaha nah
DIY,not_removed,sigh reddit where if you dont spend on a special drive cage your hard drive will explode and kill your entire family youre aware that most desktops just have the hard drive screwed into a piece of sheet metal to secure them right not even any rubber pads like this guy has and this isnt a production class server either those drives will see light use at best this subreddit is called diy for a reason not purchase overpriced unnecessary solutions from amazon
DIY,not_removed,the rubber padding does a good job cancelling the vibrations there is virtually no vibration in the drive rack i thought about using a cage like you posted but fitting such a thing inside an ikea shelf is quite the challenge especially more than one most cages hold only up to four drives hot swapping is not possible with my setup but not needed in my case pun intended i can turn off the system for a few minutes to change drives or for general maintenance they are running for about by now and there are no smart erros yet im more concerned about temperature than vibrations steadily above °c
DIY,not_removed,im pretty sure each of the hdds are on rubber feet not sure how well they work but might do the trick for his setup
DIY,not_removed,since each component is already grounded via the power cables to the power supply is it necessary
DIY,not_removed,i will have a look into that thank you for the suggestion
DIY,not_removed,love the build my only addition would be to add some kind on isolation to your drive set up to lessen the impact of vibrations
DIY,not_removed,nice catch on the single power line i assumed he had hdd per power line but theres only one plug being used on the modular power supply looking up the spec sheets for the wd red drives it has a power draw of per drive on the line maximum amps for chassis wiring on gauge wire is at full power draw for six drives thats so hes still within specs for now its fine but hell have to use a second cable for for the bottom drives it looks like its currently set up to have all twelve drives use the same chassis wire though i dont even think his motherboard has a connection so he doesnt have to worry about hitting the maximum current with his power supply if it was an old or power supply yes he would have to worry
DIY,not_removed,i have to the vibration posts afaik it should just be a matter of making sure all of the drives have rubber grommets but you will want to check on that more with google
DIY,not_removed,around the hard drives make up the bulk cost with currently chf each drives chf the mainboard comes up next with about chf the ram is around ecc kingston ram and the fans totaled around cables sata power ethernet switch and pi zero totaled at about the diy parts were pretty cheap compared the metal sections bars screws shims cost about chf this all added up to around chf prices may vary in the us edit part list prices in chf drives wd red mainboard asrock ram kingston ecc psu bequiet cm fans bequiet silentwing sata cables sleeved switch netgear prosafe diy metal section threaded bar nut shim
DIY,not_removed,inside the lan it works like a charm i also stream via vpn and then it depends on the download speed of the client network for a video with runtime you need around mbs download speed my upload speed is around so this allows clients with decent quality streaming the vpn overhead is almost negligible i tested it for my setup encrypted and it came around
DIY,not_removed,video files are the most common thing i can think of that can use that kind of storage though it also might be some degree of futureproofing going on too
DIY,not_removed,pic of your mother
DIY,not_removed,hot swapping is no real option and you can remove the entire central unit for maintenance so fiddling inside the case is not really necessary
DIY,not_removed,its running on freenas this is similar to raid
DIY,not_removed,the top lid can be taken off easily it is not screwed on the central part can be taken out in a matter of moments including all drives though it is quite heavy for maintenance or switching drives the temperatures are not in the desired range above °c i will redo the airflow fan setup some time soon rhomelab suggested using dryer sheets or pantyhose for dust filtering which is definitely on the short list for upgrades although running for a few months didnt accumulate enormous amounts of dust
DIY,not_removed,i have thought of that but space is an issue and im living in an apartement so the basement is sadly no option since it had to be inside the apartment it should be inconspicuous an therefore i used an existing shelf this is certainly not the most practical solution but a viable one with the resources at hand
DIY,not_removed,youre in rdiy thats why looks better to me too
DIY,not_removed,it provides a shared storage space to all computers on a network its good for holding music and videos to be played on whatever device you want
DIY,not_removed,its a nas network attached storage basically external hard drives shared over your network you can do some other stuff with it as well eg vpn webhosting
DIY,not_removed,its like a personal version of dropbox or google drive where you control how much storage it holds and how good its network connection is its for sharing large amounts of data between multiple computers and is especially useful inside one house where you can have everything on a gigabit connection to each other instead of having to go out to the internet
DIY,not_removed,seasonic actually makes the psus for corsair and thermaltake and is cheaper just an fyi for anyone that sees this
DIY,not_removed,the psu is not getting very hot since the system load is only around i dont have exact data but its handwarm nevertheless i will rework the airflow soon to ensure better cooling of all components mainly mainboard and drives
DIY,not_removed,wd red run around chf here so about total
DIY,not_removed,asrock
DIY,not_removed,its short for network attached storage its literally a remote data storage solution for your network
DIY,not_removed,this is more than one drive though one drive is fine especially since thats for regular consumers drive death doesnt matter this is by no means cheap and rubber pads and rubber washers are piss cheap even going to hotswap bays is by no means expensive at what op paid also this is a nas not a home computer meaning the drives are spinning and therefore vibrating and losing hours off their mtbf
DIY,not_removed,but op spent on this setup keeping your investment safe is worth it at that price
DIY,not_removed,i guess a lot of consumer cases do so that but my last couple have had rubber grommets for installing hard drives probably because the average consumer has one or two hard drives not or
DIY,not_removed,sounds like a perfect reason to build a printer you can print stack able hdd mounts random things for around the house and spikey butt plugs to give out at christmas to coworkers you dont like edit just want to say good job op looks nice and clean iev been mulling over doing something like this myself but need a miracle sale on storage i have a metric shit ton of gb sas drives at work from a retired san but id rather optimize space with drives
DIY,not_removed,typically the chassis ground and power supply ground are kept separate not having a proper chassis ground can cause charge to build up if something is fully enclosed like a router and other small electronic devices it doesnt matter but when the components are exposed it does
DIY,not_removed,you should do it to help dissipate static electricity
DIY,not_removed,yeah he is probably ok there are many people who have built wood cases without extra grounding as far as i know it has worked out okay i am not an ee however i tinker with building microcontrolled projects using a grounding wire to each component never hurts and it often fixes problems that appear random and hard to diagnose i have heard that in the past there were some motherboards that required being connected to ground at their mounting points however that is all second and third hand
DIY,not_removed,spot on there is an image of the second power cabling for the bottom drives they will be connected via a second plug like you guessed the whole system runs around idling drives spinning the mainboard cable is not part of the cable management and can not be unplugged it is tied to the psu on the left you can see it in the last image
DIY,not_removed,what is the pi zero used for
DIY,not_removed,can you tell me does that motherboard support total sata connections i see ports in the pictures for it but the description makes it sound like just and also your setup is only using i currently have a setup and im trying to figure out next steps to expand it further i will probably have to build a custom case like yours
DIY,not_removed,what are you running as an os for a setup like this im using an academic license of windows server and god damnit i love their file and storage services dedupe hot spare hot swap all easily managed through the os without needing to reboot downright lovely
DIY,not_removed,it should be inconspicuous why whats the big secret
DIY,not_removed,so kinda like a shared hdd
DIY,not_removed,could you do home automation with it or more of a moviemusic dump for say a home entertainment set up
DIY,not_removed,yeah i was just giving an example theres many sfx psus around
DIY,not_removed,damn what do you use that much space for you must have over movies
DIY,not_removed,thanks
DIY,not_removed,but i dont think you have a clue what youre talking about
DIY,not_removed,in my experience improper grounding results in weird instability issues that eventually cause crashes in the os
DIY,not_removed,it serves mainly as a backup vpn in case the server crashes i can access the ipmi interface via the zerovpn and reboot the server remotely
DIY,not_removed,yes it does support sata connections i only use six because drives are not exactly on the cheap side and i want to be able to upgrade this setup in the future years to twelve drives the current projections show drives will be significantly cheaper by then here are the exact specs of the board i ran into a few tower cases supporting up to twelve drives you might also want to have a look at those
DIY,not_removed,hes using freenas which has all those features and somewhat less overhead than a windows setup since its freebsd both are great for servers just depends on what ya wanna do
DIY,not_removed,httpwwwfreenasorg although i like httpslimetechnologycomwhatisunraid from httpslimetechnologycom unraid is newer so there are some issues but it has lots of those same features that you list and it has very reasonable prices
DIY,not_removed,its not a big secret but as ive said space is an issue and a premade case was to big to fit anywhere hidden my appartement council did not approve of installing such an ugly thingy so i had to find a way to fit it in or let go of it
DIY,not_removed,yes sort of since its a full blown machine you can do other stuff with it as well like a vpn or webhosting i mainly use it as a storage available from anywhere in the world sort of like my own dropbox the webhosting part offers some nice convenient features like a personal dashboard for news mail and other stuff it is not publicly visible for security reasons only via vpn
DIY,not_removed,or more of a moviemusic dump for say a home entertainment set up yes thats often why you use a nas in a home setup
DIY,not_removed,do you work with high capacity networks and servers everyday cuz i fucking do its my job
DIY,not_removed,i have ground problems with a freshly made diy case can you help me sort the problems out the case is painted metal the motherboard has stand offs made with nuts and spacers so theyre also metal the psu is touching the case for a little part and is doublesidedtaped for the most part i dont really know where is the problem
DIY,not_removed,just a note zfs does not as i understand it support expanding your array capacity by adding additional drives this is the only problem i have found with it so far so you may want to prepare yourself for that migration ahead of schedule afaik the only expansion avenue is by onebyone increasing each drives capacity you can technically expand your pool but it wont expand the underlying redundant array it will just span the data across your original array and a new nonredundant array
DIY,not_removed,yes it depends on your needs and knowledge without any previous unix experience its hard to use freenas up to its potential freenas also has a very large and helpful community if you run into any issues
DIY,not_removed,wow where the hell do you live that they can tell you what kind of computers you can have in your apartment its not a horrible idea hiding it but as others have pointed out its hard to work on airflow not the best and no vibration dampening just to be the top three well sounds like you will be upgrading some items on it ill wait for the updated photos
DIY,not_removed,thats nice
DIY,not_removed,ill bet none of them are mounted in ikea furniture so they dont really compare
DIY,not_removed,yeah thats a problem im facing but as far is i understand it its a logical restriction of raid systems in general i plan on installing a second pool with another drives once the need arises and the prices have gone down significantly this way both pools have the same redundancy depending on data usage and drive costs i might also look into migration and creating one big pool the next upgrade step would be exchanging the drives for bigger ones onebyone i had a look into installing drives from the start away but the price tag of this was quite hefty and given the current trajectory of storage prices it didnt seem sensible with my current usage i will run out of space in years from now which incidentally is the life expectancy of these drives edit once they start failing they probably will be replaced with larger drives or even more depending on prices
DIY,not_removed,does freenas support zfs are you using it ive got a linuxbased zfs nas currently and its been absolutely flawless for the several years since i began using it
DIY,not_removed,well yes and no on my old mdadm setup i was able to expand the array capacity by adding additional drives httpsraidwikikernelorgindexphpgrowing then you just resize the filesystem to take advantage of the new increased capacity this may be specific to software raid or maybe even specific to mdadm itself but i know for sure it was possible that said i ended up having that array fail completely to an unrecoverable point and since then i abandoned mdadm for zfs and havent had any issues i just know this was one of my concerns im afraid when i go to expand my capacity by adding more drives that i will basically have to stand up a totally new array and copy the data over manually or do it as youve done it but then i believe i would have to make each array have its own filesystem i could be mistaken on that though do you know
DIY,not_removed,yes it does this was one of the main reasons i decided to use freenas it works perfectly fine for me as well ive had zero issues with it
DIY,not_removed,yea thats normal the bottom portion floats in the body of the switch
DIY,not_removed,if the red part is wiggling up to maybe inside the switch thats gonna be normal
DIY,not_removed,ocd asf
DIY,not_removed,i dont think so ive bought some from radioshack which never did that
DIY,not_removed,different brand different manufacturer different environmental rating all will have a different wiggle but the wiggle is normal and part of the normal manufacturing process design typically the cheaper the switch the more slop in its motion due to loser manufacturing tolerances
DIY,not_removed,so theres no way to fix it maybe put an epoxy in between the button and the wall
DIY,not_removed,you can but youd most likely glue the button to the housing

DIY,not_removed,im a fan of toggler snaptoggle bolts probably overkill but youll never worry they can hold pounds in regular drywall
DIY,not_removed,i almost always use the screw in style anchors they sell at homedepot and have never had a problem theyre rated to each
DIY,not_removed,shear rating
DIY,not_removed,hit all the studs you can and use fasteners that are at the thicker end of the spectrum for your drywall anchors pick your length for the ones that go into the studs so you get at least inch into the stud the length for the fasteners going into the cry wall anchors should be as long as the anchors plus the thickness of your metal panels
DIY,not_removed,thanks for the recommendation these seem to be the best combination of strength vs cost i just picked up a pack of them appreciate it
DIY,not_removed,yeah i second these
DIY,not_removed,ive used these to hang so much stuff i wouldnt trust them away from the nearest stud with a ton of weight but distributing the weight these have never had a problem for me
DIY,not_removed,those would be my choice not a fan of toggle bolts
DIY,not_removed,followup i looked at your metal pegboard for that price you could get times the amount of space with a x sheet of pegboard and a x frame stiffen it up by running horizontal pieces of x not vertical
DIY,not_removed,thats what i was afraid of there would be per panel but id be worried about one of them failing if too much weight was concentrated in the wrong place
DIY,not_removed,honestly i have hung flat screens with four of them and had no issue hitting a stud would always be preferable but with per panel it should hold per panel plus the panel itself should distribute the weight with allowing for too much concentration in one spot
DIY,not_removed,these are excellent i use them for everything have you ever picked up a weight its a hell of a lot

DIY,not_removed,lovely clean lines great job
DIY,not_removed,that is awesome fantastic job
DIY,not_removed,fiberboard aka mdf nice results
DIY,not_removed,that was the first thing i noticed swoon op was this just meticulously placed freehanded taping
DIY,not_removed,yes exactly this was not my first attempt i learned how to apply the tape as close to accurately as i can but i did not figure it out immediately my first few attempts were pretty amateur hour this is the first attempt that i think turned out to be of acceptably high quality im making another one now with an extra border that i think will look really nice im learning a little bit more on each attempt ive had one person offer to buy one and another im donating to a church i like variety when i play chess so im making a few to keep heres a preview of the next one im making in progress picture on the left mockup of the finished product on the right
DIY,not_removed,im jealous of these skills any plans to do an epoxy resin coat
DIY,not_removed,no but i dont know much about it what kind of advantage would that have
DIY,not_removed,thought you might be interested in seeing the finished paint job on the board i was making in the above post
DIY,not_removed,would give it an awesome almost glass covered effect and serve as protection
DIY,not_removed,yesssss seriously those lines though

DIY,not_removed,roots are in the ground so doing it from even the top vents on the roof is nonsensical put the crystals dry into the line and the water will leach the poison over weeks and months into the water feeding any roots inside the line thus chemically burning them out of the line edit the toilet is fine and read the instructions for dispersal we use half a container at the beginning and late growing periods
DIY,not_removed,i understand i wanted to see if it would be effective if i poured the dry crystals down the second floor bathroom my basement is occupied by my housemate and i dont want to disturb him would be it a effective pouring down the second floor as it would be pouring down the clean out thank you very much for responding
DIY,not_removed,yes the only problems i can imagine are staining the toilet flush and then dump and a steep pipe that washes away the crystals we find the less crystals but more frequent approach useful here i think it might be common that roots and flat pipes go hand in hand as there is standing water where roots clog things up in my experience
DIY,not_removed,sure you can its actually a prime surface for it just scuff the old finish up this creates a tooth for the contact cement to bond with sand tack cloth maybe even some oil less paint thinner like xylene will prep it perfectly
DIY,not_removed,what kind of laminate depends on many factors but anything is possible especially with modern adhesives original laminates bond irregular surface thickness of new laminate adhesive used method environment etc will all play into how successful this will be
DIY,not_removed,whats wrong with the old laminate is it peeling in some spots if so youre best off to strip the old laminate if its not cover that bad larry up and call it a day
DIY,not_removed,you could but it wouldnt look as nice and might not lay flat
DIY,not_removed,just did my counter tops this way works perfect

DIY,not_removed,so this article says that for elastomeric paint to work right it needs several coats one easy way to gage if an elastomeric coating was applied too thin is to compare the gallons of material used to the number of square feet covered theoretical coverage with elastomerics is in the range of square feet per gallon to yield the final dry film thickness versus the typical square feet per gallon attained with conventional paints so if the paint manufacturer verifies that gallons of material were used but the contractor shows you square feet coated you know youve got a problem

DIY,not_removed,thats how you pronounce the state but opposite of how you pronounce the city of nevada in missouri
DIY,not_removed,nevadan checking in i usually hear outofstaters pronounce it as nayvawduh not sure if transientfilled las vegas say it differently but the northern majority pronounces it nschwavaaduh my apologies for the crunchy phonetic spelling im not familiar enough with reddit formatting to know how to insert an actual schwa the upsidedown e thing had a floridian friend once who made it his goal to trip me up just once pronouncing my own states name well played melbourne well played
DIY,not_removed,i was looking at this thinking how difficult it would be to do virginia bit there it is doesnt look too hard did you just tape up a cut out and then put the pins on the edges
DIY,not_removed,my gf got one for us on etsy they look great
DIY,not_removed,very impressive i always thought of doing one of these as well but i dont like the big shapes the depth you were able to get with layering the string changes things though i may have to do this exact thing using the seattle skyline

DIY,not_removed,its nevada and people have lost elections jobs and work contracts for saying it wrong
DIY,not_removed,print out state on piece of paper place paper on wood hammer nails through paper remove paper
DIY,not_removed,i just loaded an image into photoshop looked at the ratios of each side and used that to figure out the size of each line in comparison to how tall i wanted the image
DIY,not_removed,for mine i just printed the state out and cut it out idaho so it was a little tricky with all the twists and turns outlined it on the wood in pencil and nailed on the outline
DIY,not_removed,you say not to shabby
DIY,not_removed,i am also curious about this
DIY,not_removed,but you did them props for seeing it through very nice work
DIY,not_removed,thats because nevadas stuck in the
DIY,not_removed,how big are we talking here i have time
DIY,not_removed,as someone from saskatchewan i share wyomings sentiment
DIY,not_removed,the state state is about open space primarily because the feds need it to befor reasons i feel closedin in most other states not claustrophobic just like i have no room to stretch or like im on a subway sharing my personal space with strangers
DIY,not_removed,i like the idea of this it would be a real conversation piece at that size you could make it multipurpose furniture the open wood spaces could hold other alaskan mementos or a small shelf or it could be built spanning a or panel room divider
DIY,not_removed,nevada state colors are silver and blue i dig the blue though i could see this looking fantastic in silver
DIY,not_removed,hey hey hey thats on the next one i believe this was his first gotta start somewhere at least nv doesnt have tons of tiny counties like most other states that would make it near impossible to tell that county lines had been the goal
DIY,not_removed,psst fix your link i wanna see your rendition of iowa
DIY,not_removed,step smoke canvas
DIY,not_removed,cuz
DIY,not_removed,like the state of nevada
DIY,not_removed,state colors are silver and blue he stayed true to form
DIY,not_removed,
DIY,not_removed,its true string can be a hard concept to grasp for some
DIY,not_removed,as a coloradoan it would almost be boring and people would wonder why i like rectangles so much
DIY,not_removed,could be worse you could have an outline like michigan or florida
DIY,not_removed,thats when you find some etsy shop that makes stuff like this and pay someone else to do it xd
DIY,not_removed,as a washingtonian i do not like the idea of doing this
DIY,not_removed,youre a crested butte
DIY,not_removed,one day i learned the colorado border has a couple jogs and i like to imagine its their biggest secret shame

DIY,not_removed,thanks i was hoping it wouldnt turn out like a grader did it
DIY,not_removed,why alaska
DIY,not_removed,id rather have kim jong un than chris christie
DIY,not_removed,i did jersey first and was just randomly trying to fill in spots a little more thought went into pa as you can see more of a distinctive pattern
DIY,not_removed,so i did a similar project but i did the space needle and basically you make your outline with as few pins as possible then put some throughout the middle then using string or rubber bands you just go from one outline pin to another across from it zig zagging around the middle as it gets there
DIY,not_removed,you settled in oklahoma
DIY,not_removed,stillers and yanks
DIY,not_removed,that looks a little too far se to be lancaster
DIY,not_removed,more like chester or delaware
DIY,not_removed,loved that show what ever happened to it
DIY,not_removed,or you could just say the colorado river
DIY,not_removed,are you sure about new mexico the texasnm border near el paso is pretty close to the path of the rio grande and its the only part that isnt a straight line its not exact mind you but the rio grande has changed paths before maybe a historical path of the rio grande i tried googling but i couldnt find anything
DIY,not_removed,or you could just say the colorado river
DIY,not_removed,actually its co ut wy id and mt and nm if you count that technicality that you mentioned id and mt are defined by the mountain range between them
DIY,not_removed,ut border wad defined by the american jesus
DIY,not_removed,sorry i was mistaken its the north west corner of arizona
DIY,not_removed,battle born
DIY,not_removed,nevada yay
DIY,not_removed,out by the truckee silvery rills out where the sun always shines correction noted edit made rills

DIY,not_removed,southern nevada is best nevada
DIY,not_removed,i just printed out the of the state and hammered the nails along the border i tried different httpiimgurcomfqsqstbjpg of stringing the yarn
DIY,not_removed,thats what i saw a friend do for michigan cut the state put of a map then pinned all around it
DIY,not_removed,you guys are so judgmental the only thing more beautiful than a rectangle is a square
DIY,not_removed,very true i guess a could do a colorado state flag or something along those lines thanks for the inspiration op i need to get my creative juices flowing again
DIY,not_removed,alaska would be a nightmare
DIY,not_removed,ooo ive heard of those states too
DIY,not_removed,ive got some wood from ct over here
DIY,not_removed,i feel like pronouncing the states name correctly is kind of important if you want its people to let you run it
DIY,not_removed,burn paper to remove
DIY,not_removed,im thinking about trying this with my state california and have a few questions how long is the side from lake tahoe to the very southern tip or the total dimensions how far apart are the nails they look about to but not really sure did you use a specific pattern for the string layout or did you just do what felt right is it one long string or a few shorter ones
DIY,not_removed,found it i dont see the naked man but i found it none the less
DIY,not_removed,yeah the state with the most advanced security systems in the world in stuck in the
DIY,not_removed,i dont know how big if we get the scale of this state then use that factor for the whole us that would be pretty cool
DIY,not_removed,as a quebecer moving to waterloo im now also laughing at saskatchewans shape while confused with my provinces
DIY,not_removed,im happy with the progress weve made here
DIY,not_removed,meh only in spots last time i went for a drive many of them were shut down left in ruins but i stick to the northern so i cant speak for las vegas and company there are some towns that nearly thrive on it such as mound house yes that is the actual name wiki says theres only brothels in the entire state but i call shenanigans because i pass about different brothels in mound house alone when i pass through did i mention it doesnt even have a traffic light for those who are curious hit google maps and take a stroll using street view look at the signs on the sides of the road
DIY,not_removed,to be fair i had a great time train from chicago to reno drove from reno down to amargosa valley via walker lake tonopah etc lots of nothing but it was beautiful saw a lots of oddities area trucks stop and brothel for example i love the american west
DIY,not_removed,ok
DIY,not_removed,do you see my point though the background is fine its already silver and blue there has to have been a better color for the string
DIY,not_removed,as a massachusetts resident theres no fucking way id do this
DIY,not_removed,make sure to include a heart or star somewhere
DIY,not_removed,minnesooootaaa
DIY,not_removed,i was just thinking the same thing it could be worse
DIY,not_removed,rep
DIY,not_removed,would you string out all the lakes too
DIY,not_removed,well then how about a topographical map of utah
DIY,not_removed,add the northwest angle on lotw too because technically we should own that maybe put it in red thread as a future proposition
DIY,not_removed,do you pronounce it coloradoan or coloradan
DIY,not_removed,florida here i love state string art but when i think about the work involved i realize there arent enough bath salts in the world to give me the energy to actually attempt it with my coastline
DIY,not_removed,maryland says hello and good luck
DIY,not_removed,oooohh im from michigan this would be fun
DIY,not_removed,youre looking for rdifm
DIY,not_removed,they can just say utahs and new mexicos fault

DIY,not_removed,mmm yes and no the darkness of this particular blue stands out nicely from his chosen background which is hard to do with such widely varied shades of wood and finish being from the state knowing the common colors found in that particular desert and i appreciate him sticking with the naturalrustic shades feels more homey to me now if he had been a unlv fan i could see him using red or white if this were just some random shape for the string art with that background i might go for some burnt orange like autumn leaves or perhaps hunter green or maybe find some honeycolored fishing line or craft wire i love artistic collaboration what color would you choose would you change the background

DIY,not_removed,agricultural mechanical
DIY,not_removed,to further uihappentobearobots answer it technically stood for agricultural mechanical officially speaking its just texas am university its gone through a few name changes though it started as the agricultural mechanical college of texas which is why in their fight song httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvuodsulaqok they say were from texas amc more info than youd ever care to know im sure and found the aggie but i thought id give a little more history edit realized i fucked up were from texas amc is in httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvxjvedzobsfq
DIY,not_removed,i have a self made template that i drew digitally and scaled to the appropriate size
DIY,not_removed,honest question how was your hearing after all that did you wear hearing protection would earplugs suffice i want to make one of these but my ears dont recover from loud sound like they used to
DIY,not_removed,eh co native here its honestly just an easy way to spot tourists and transplants from tx ca and or the rest of us dont really make a big deal out of it
DIY,not_removed,

DIY,not_removed,my old roommate was from fallon theyve invented these things called automobiles since the last time youve been out of your hometown check them out theyre like horses but they dont shit everywhere
DIY,not_removed,thats a horrible place
DIY,not_removed,i would probably use white it doesnt entirely solve the problem but it fixes most of it because the biggest problem right now is that the big dark part of the wood in the middle sort of cuts the state in half at a glance where its black string on dark wood with white there would still be some harder to see parts but theyd be far less pronounced
DIY,not_removed,norway representin fuck this
DIY,not_removed,haha i love how the only post is a modpost about the op being a collection and therefore not allowed and it got downvoted
DIY,not_removed,remindme months
DIY,not_removed,how did it go
DIY,not_removed,so did ya do it
DIY,not_removed,it would be easier than michigan especially if you want to incorporate the lakes
DIY,not_removed,throws gator through drivethru window
DIY,not_removed,you need to hammer in nails and the string needs to be wrapped in a certain way to fill in space while not filling too much space and having it all even too its just time consuming is all
DIY,not_removed,mmmrough guess for this exact one looking through his imgur album id say hours cumulative with one big intermission while the stains set and another for the glue to set a span of days would be my guess schedule breakdown day cut boards and apply stain hour let stain set typically hours see package instructions day arrange and glue boards hour but longer if you use httpwwwfamilyhandymancomwoodworkingwoodjointshowtomakeabiscuitjointviewall which should make it stronger op didnt show whether or not he did this let glue set with or without biscuits typically hours watch for drips weeping and bubbles usually occurring in the first couple hours theyre easier to clean up at this point day draw scale image drive nails wind string about hours depending on the complexity
DIY,not_removed,if you digitize the contour so that it consists of linear elements you can actually scare people with its threatening gaping aperture
DIY,not_removed,at least it would be recognizable

DIY,not_removed,a bunch of people had already answered his question and he had made an edit to indicate that his question implied that he was surprised that the whole state wasnt straight lines so i offered an interesting bit of information to say that in fact states made of straight lines are relatively rare then you came along and rained all over my fun fact because you are a thoroughly unpleasant person

DIY,not_removed,except michiganwell they have it but you probably dont want it
DIY,not_removed,what about that
DIY,not_removed,holy shit ive been thinking it was agriculture and military my whole goddamn life even when i applied and got accepted to am i still had it wrong the whole time my mom fucking lied to me
DIY,not_removed,technically correct is best correct
DIY,not_removed,every time im there i see so many shirts hats tattoos and car stickers with the flag on them im not saying youre lying im just saying no other state ive been to has as many state flags everywhere
DIY,not_removed,i know quite a few people that are from colorado im a midwest transplant to the state that cherish the flag and such personally i see it as an appreciation for what were living in way too many people that are from here take stuff for granted here such as like red rocks i know too many that havent even been there before and theyve lived here all their life
DIY,not_removed,so thats a no then i assume youre never been to austin fernley winnemucca lovelock tonopah or carson for starters either
DIY,not_removed,agreed im so glad im on the other end of the country

DIY,not_removed,lol you sound like pretty much everyone ive ever met from bfe nevada if you know a way to get from vegas to reno without going through tonopah lovelock or fernley id like to hear it but no cant say ive ever camped out in any of those shitty places for fun

DIY,not_removed,no hate but is using sas as an abbreviation a common thing ive never heard of it but i live in saskatchewan so i havent heard of a lot of things
DIY,not_removed,this thread could go for days thank you for being soooo fucked up florida
DIY,not_removed,well there is no argument that bath salts are a big problem in the gator community
DIY,not_removed,home means nevada to me
DIY,not_removed,any time thats what i am here for specifically that
DIY,not_removed,no the wall is coming after november
DIY,not_removed,aw come on well have nunavut you must know where it is
DIY,not_removed,its worse
DIY,not_removed,it isnt this person moved out of sk caught up to how the rest of the world is and has become stupider i think living somewhere that has a hockey team has pushed other shit out of their brain cant blame them tho they are from saskatchewan
DIY,not_removed,i would leave a smaller gap if any at all your drywall stops about off the subfloor you have the thickness of your drywall to play with before the board touches the studs make your cut end flush or just past so its hidden but with enough room for expansionor not on just the one plank itll likely be fine you can make the inside of the closet however you want good place to hide stuff like you described or use scraps and end pieces if you can make them look decent usually a closet will have junk covering it at all times anyways
DIY,not_removed,use a door jamb saw like this one take a piece of your underlayment your laminate and a piece of cardboard and stack them under the saw against the door jamb and cut far enough so that the cut edges of the piece will be hidden under the door casing then use pieces in the doorway sliding each under the door jamb this is how we do every material tile hardwood etc flooring contractor
DIY,not_removed,the doorway opening is smaller than one plank can i slide the plank under the drywall like an undercut door jamb and hammer it into place from the side rather than dropping it in at an angle
DIY,not_removed,pretty much its such a small area i wouldnt sweat it do what seems to make sense
DIY,not_removed,thanks
DIY,not_removed,the white pvc with the hex is screwed into the black with plumbers putty to seal it you need to cut the piece thats glued into that adapter and replace the adapter and the elbow at least youll need enough parts and pipe to tie back into the drain because you cant reassemble it without some clearance you could look for something like a street elbow where the bend glues right into the adapter but to be honest i dont know if that exists get it apart and take the pieces to the hardware store and buy what you need to rebuild it edit clarified my first paragraph
DIY,not_removed,also you secondary drain is blocked red plug
DIY,not_removed,use some hose cutters cut as low as possible look for a thick wall hose and heat it up in hot water to expand the inner diameter to slid over the cut drain fitting repeat on the second end and connect to the pvc pipe also the secondary drain is plugged make sure to remove the red plug that end should drain onto the drain pan to prevent water getting on the ceiling
DIY,not_removed,most drain lines are pvc the red plug is your secondary just in case your primary gets clogged you can buy a float switch that will screw into your secondary and just wire it into your low voltage wires so if it tries to flood it shuts your unit off so you dont have to worry about it
DIY,not_removed,also you dont want to tighten the primary drain plug all the way or even use glue for that matter it should be hand tight or snug on there if you make it too tight it can snap your pan then you would have to replace the primary pan as well so hand tight would be best no glue
DIY,not_removed,took it apart and you were spot on i have just enough room to back the pipes out so no worries there should i use plumbers putty or should i use pipe dope to thread the new pvc into the black pipe i havent had to work with pvc all that often so not sure thanks
DIY,not_removed,so i should just use a hose as the coupling also youre saying i should remove the red plug and leave it open or what
DIY,not_removed,yes he is suggesting that you use the hose as a coupling installing a worm clamp over the hosefitting connection should insure that it does not leak as for the red plug if you can find a nipple to screw in to it and a hose to attach to the nipple id run the new drain hose to floor drain sink or even a large bucket it is a backup but one you may need
DIY,not_removed,if you dont get it off id shut off the water inside open the valve and drain the hose as best you can it wont burst if its empty
DIY,not_removed,a multiweather homeowner here vinegar added to whitcwas hammer vinegar will loosen the chemical bond the light hammering will help it penetrate
DIY,not_removed,have you tried using a pipe wrench or pliers to remove it
DIY,not_removed,lime away works wonders
DIY,not_removed,aye i considered that but the bib is plumbed directly to the main house line theres nowhere to shut it off without shutting off water to the entire house
DIY,not_removed,knipex pliers and pipe wrench before and after heating
DIY,not_removed,will it work into the threads
DIY,not_removed,another thought try tapping lightly with a hammer around the threads to break up the minerals and try tightening as well as loosening very slight movement should eventually break up the corrosion or just cut the hose off and put a new end on it later
DIY,not_removed,if you have the means to spray it i always recommend chemcraft aquaprime it is a water based primer that is ridiculous in every way far superior to any wood primer i have used thin it down with clean water
DIY,not_removed,another good thing about the aquaprime is i havent found anything that it reacts with seems to cover just about anything and never complains
DIY,not_removed,when you prime or paint the layers need to dry before applying new coats so the colors leaching out may be that you didnt allow proper drying time between coats i suggest sanding and restarting if you continue to add more coats the undry coats underneath will remain wet and leach more and look worse as time goes on when you do paint new layers i suggest lightly sanding the layer before applying a new one with very fine sandpaper and then dusting to remove any particles that may have stuck to the top while drying and it gives a smoother look when youre done with all layers message me if you have any questions
DIY,not_removed,i would just go with ferric chloride its cheap and you can pick it up easily editto get the dark finish for cleaning it just use fine steel wool
DIY,not_removed,powder coating is your friend

DIY,not_removed,mine has miles and it seeped really bad on the drivers side drive it up on ramps and look underneath youll be able to see the oil weeping out of either the valve cover gaskets or the head gaskets mines a sohc naturally aspirated impreza so they have the shitty paper headgaskets that fail externally i noticed a lot of oil haze on the underside of the engine when i got this car a year ago it will smell like burned oilburned plastic on hot days when you park it in the garage after a commute home if its leaking oil from either of them i got quoted from gillman subaru in houston to do the valve cover gaskets i did the drivers side and will do the passenger side tomorrow i hear and with good reason that the drivers side is a real bitch to do compared to the passenger side but to succinctly answer your question yes valve cover and head gaskets are very common issue on all engines compared to a straight engine theyre a real asshole to replace even compared to a bmw are they a pain to replace ive done valve cover jobs on cars and this was the most annoying not hard but just annoying hardest was the for how much shit you have to move out of the way to do it e the four engines ive done are porsche flat easy as shit annoying and prone to fuckups from coil packs not seated correctly honda easy as pie if you remember to do the valve cover before the timing cover fuck you
DIY,not_removed,looks like an older house to me im guessing the wall is plaster the rough texture that appears to be on the wall would make floating the corner out with mud stand out like a sore thumb i suggest patching the corner with plaster no more than the areas that are chipped and sand just those areas
DIY,not_removed,depends how much work you want to do it will look okay if you fill the cracks and sand it down but i think screwing metal corner bead to it would also work just fine and you would have a nicer looking corner
DIY,not_removed,it is possible to retrofit a corner bead on there two ways that i know of to get the job done both do the same thing and may look the same to the untrained eye simply nail the corner bead on existing wall and mud away to feather it in this method will make the wall flare out more at the corner bead which needs to be corrected with lots of mud to feather it in and may affect the squareness of the corner like if you had a piece of furniture up in that corner remove a strip of drywall material on both sides where the corner bead goes so you can recess the corner bead and have it sit more flush with the wall surface requires slightly less mud work
DIY,not_removed,ditto doesnt look like there is any corner bead that would limit any future cracking too

DIY,not_removed,i would look at a mister system and install it easy to do and it will cool at least ° if you pay careful attention upon install live in idaho so it really only gets hot for a few weeks a year last summer my neighbor had a similar problem on his deck which was simply shaded by open sided gazebos but still had no air circulation used painted pvc supply upper perimeter and tapped in mister heads at pre figured distances even ran a few into the middle worked beautifully was cheap also he had a water spigot right there and the most expensive costs were the brass adapter to make that a two valve spigot the piece from this to the pvc adapters for the frame mount used one of those short spring wrapped hoses used to keep the hose from kinking at the spigot also added a pvc ball valve up on the frame to control water flow but i think the mister heads adjust individually all in all it looked factory perfect was secured with zip ties for winter storage and literally cost less than hope it helps you out it made a big difference for my neighbor
DIY,not_removed,put up the wood and use felt and pound rolled roofing to protect it from the rain should last years if you do it right life pro tip if you want to leave the wood exposed paint or stain it before you install it easier on your neck and arms
DIY,not_removed,i will definitely look in to it thanks
DIY,not_removed,stain will only last though it does weatherproof it and you could do a solid color such as white im wondering if ops support studs are spaced correctly for a wooden roof
DIY,not_removed,you know you are right they have a weird spacing and now that i look at it closer there are no lag bolts holding that ledger board to the house wonder if it is being held on by nothing more than nails that is scary
DIY,not_removed,my thoughts exactly when initially looking at this its alright for the light weight thats on it right now but its sort of a ticking time bomb good to know im not the only one who is scared about what op is trying to do here
DIY,not_removed,i will check tomorrow morning to see how they are held up i believe the thicker beams are lag bolted the thinner ones may not be that being the case i would definitely look to having it professionally done instead im unsure why it was done like that but i do know the previous owner rented the place long term and the people living here did numerous quick fixes that were baffling to say the least

DIY,not_removed,nice job but still a bike
DIY,not_removed,you really need bar end caps ever seen a handle bar punch a hole
DIY,not_removed,this looks like a ghost bike a bike that is painted white and chained permanently to mark the location of bicyclists deaths
DIY,not_removed,needs a motor
DIY,not_removed,when i was a kid i took my bike down a hill and crashed it straight into the house and the handlebar caught me right over the nipple i remember the doctor saying id be in the hospital or worse if not for my handlebar grip because without it the handlebar would have taken a core plug good job on the bike though i hope you enjoy it
DIY,not_removed,oh definitely im just going to have to diy some and close that up i was thinking of making some sort of rope knot to match the handles
DIY,not_removed,geez lucky you dude thank you i plan on making end caps for sure
DIY,not_removed,corks work pretty good for that and should go well with your design
DIY,not_removed,thats genius thank you for the idea
DIY,not_removed,hey op this is really nice as a professional upholsterer i can tell you the special machine for those buttons isnt worth it hope you got them made at a reasonable rate a few other notes the piping around the base is called welt and the batting is dacron
DIY,not_removed,are the screws visible or were they eventually covered
DIY,not_removed,really nice job i especially like the excellent job you did on the tufting was this your first time doing upholstery
DIY,not_removed,nice job op but man i fuckin hate that fake distressed look on things
DIY,not_removed,what a beaut
DIY,not_removed,love the rug very nice job on the upholstery upholstery staplers are a godsend
DIY,not_removed,forgot to mention got the buttons made and covered washers with them
DIY,not_removed,my question as well seems like it would be easy enough to stuff the holes and put some matching buttons on top
DIY,not_removed,i agree everyones entitled to their preferences of course but theres something about painting over wood that bothers me its almost a shame to cover up the natural grain
DIY,not_removed,hot glue gun
DIY,not_removed,stain alone wont protect the wood from spills minor scrapes will remove the stain leaving bare wood exposed properly done the finishing of the stained wood will include two finish coats of polyurethane or other appropriate coating
DIY,not_removed,staining doesnt provide any protection for the wood at all polyurethaning it is a good idea id recommend doing so before you install it
DIY,not_removed,stain alone isnt a finish just coloring so you want a finish like poly on top they make products that are stain and poly in one but i wouldnt advise them because then its harder to control how deeply tinted your baseboards are
DIY,not_removed,thanks for the confirmation ill toss a couple layers of poly on them before they go up then i appreciate the responses
DIY,not_removed,use poly and do it before you install it so you just need to touch it up also this will keep the smell down in the house
DIY,not_removed,diy
DIY,not_removed,go for it

DIY,not_removed,specifically asking for interior design advice isnt a how do i do this diy project question check out rhomeimprovement or one of the interior design subreddits thanks
DIY,not_removed,points for knowing the word astragal i would use a hand planer and just gradually shave it off until you get to the door im sure it is glued too but the planer can handle that
DIY,not_removed,pictures of the door
DIY,not_removed,id cut most of it with a circ saw to get close then if you have a hand plane finish with that otherwise a palm sander will get the rest of it off i doubt its glued on prob just stuck with too many layers of paint
DIY,not_removed,its probably nailed on with finish nails use a small thin pry bar work from the top first and go carefully so you dont deny the door edge you should be able to pry it off fairly easily
DIY,not_removed,we made pretty much the same onewe added cubbies to the side made ours about years ago and the top board on the headboard is warping a bit shouldve used more glue
DIY,not_removed,what was the cost of this project i love it
DIY,not_removed,your foz look like it handled the load well i did a similar thing with my foz but i had osb with a bunch of i think i saw someone on this sub having wood coming out the moonroof
DIY,not_removed,hahahaha wow i didnt even think about that
DIY,not_removed,right around glad you like
DIY,not_removed,right why are clamps so expensive anyway
DIY,not_removed,a friend once told me to save up those harbor freight coupons and just buy clamps using the off if youre lucky and you can stock up in no time
DIY,not_removed,stop eating your nails
DIY,not_removed,wire it just like it is fan to existing fan wire light to existing light wire ground to ground and tie nuetrals together and connect whit wire from fan to them
DIY,not_removed,its ok to connect neutrals from different circuits together like that i feel like i read that it wasnt good to do that
DIY,not_removed,exactly the manual should tell you what the black wire is for and what the blue one is for those will be your hot wires
DIY,not_removed,yes nuetrals are not circuit specific
DIY,not_removed,no it is not ok the junction box was wired incorrectly from the getgo although perhaps ok for the year it was done i have no idea im not an electrician but by laymans understanding of the nec for residential applications is any outlet or fixture must be served by either a single circuit or multiple circuits with their breakers bonded together so a fault will cut both hots for multiple circuits i cant think of any acceptable usage other than pairing up ab phase for service the logic being it is very dangerous to have a fixtureoutletwhatever where flipping a breaker cuts off some but not all of the power to that item neutrals from multiple circuits must not be bonded together anywhere except at the service panel logic being if you have two circuits both hot and neutral are rated at that and the breaker will trip if this is exceeded if you use only one neutral that rated neutral wire will see before a breaker trips if you use two neutrals you have no assurance the current will be evenly distributed and additionally if either neutral comes loose or is otherwise damaged youre back to a wire handling
DIY,not_removed,thx i know what they are for on the fan but my wires from the ceiling box are different than shown in the manual and pretty much every tutorialexplanation i can find online
DIY,not_removed,thank you i spoke with an electrician and he said pretty much the same thing except he added the rated wire could possibly even start a fire with the potential extra load im not sure why the house is wired with two circuits at the ceiling box the original wiring is and was probably modified in the the fan that came down had separate wiring for the fan motor and fan light i am now considering the best route to take try to make it work hooked up to all one circuit or call an electrician to run some new wiring the right way

DIY,not_removed,ac sounds like something you should be figuring out how to do when you dont know how from people off a diy subreddit good lord man call an electrician
DIY,not_removed,sounds like a brush less motor you need a controller circuit to run it youre better off trying to get a replacement switch
DIY,not_removed,the odds are that switch isnt a switch its a starter yes you do turn the motor on and off with it but its more than just a switch there a good into to all the ways single phase induction motors can be made to startrun httpwwwelectronicshuborgtypesofsinglephaseinductionmotors which might let you get it going
DIY,not_removed,can you get a few photos for us particularly any terminal designations the wire colours to me say phase but thats the canadian electrician in me that makes little sense if there is a starting capacitor it could be possible to use a switch if the capacitor is on a centrifugal switch however you would want a hp rated switch to do so due to the large inrush current at the moment of start
DIY,not_removed,standard induction motor with a capacitor ac
DIY,not_removed,definitley sounds like a starter depending on where the capacitor is wired it could be either a permanent split capacitor starter in which case it should be fine without the regulator or a csr capacitor startrun if the later is true the capacitor on your motor will be the run capacitor and your regulator controls your startup alternatively the regulator is a pwm soft starter and wont work at all without a pwm controller would be useful to see some pics of motorcontrollerregulator
DIY,not_removed,well thats a phase motor so your question about positive and negative doesnt make sense to me
DIY,not_removed,single phase motor
DIY,not_removed,im suspecting you may be in australia or brazil single phase can be obtained i believe off of a wye configuration but its really uncommon i know i wouldnt feel comfortable trying to accomplish it youll probably need an on site electrician to consult on this problem reddit isnt going to do the trick
DIY,not_removed,for witcher really love the slimmer bezels and the creativity in getting a mounting solution that works for you nice job that being said you used tape instead of paint on the bezels because you mentioned lacking the skill but you know how to use a printer lol wut watch the karate kid like once mr miyagi can give you all the painting skills you need
DIY,not_removed,the package said its used for airplanes umm they meant airplane model kits not full sized ones that carry people you probably want epoxy or some kind of physical fastener im willing to bet that superglue will let go given the monitor weight and constant heat cycles and that one day youll walk into the room to find it shattered on the floor
DIY,not_removed,its more of a problem that there is no space for the paint to dry outside its cold and inside not much space and i dont want to risk the paint getting somewhere where it does not belong like the actual display d and this was just a quick solution
DIY,not_removed,theres some truth to the packaging loctite makes some pretty serious adhesives and thread lockers that are used on planes boats cars etc source have used loctite on cars red thread locker is the shit
DIY,not_removed,nt airplane model kits not full sized ones that carry people you pro the monitors have been up for a good months at least the first one i am casually trying to remove the monitor from the plastic with no luck so far it just holds each monitor is around it should be fine if it falls you will be the first to know it btw and actually they did mean real airplanes the ones that carry people httpwwwloctiteconsumercoukendidyouknowaboutloctiteairplaneshtml
DIY,not_removed,fair enough haha way to use what you have available
DIY,not_removed,i use red and blue loctite thread locker all the time it is not the same as loctite branded superglue
DIY,not_removed,i love the shot of the guy with a turbine engine are they insinuating that its glued together with that stuff im never flying again
DIY,not_removed,i get the difference between thread locker and super glue im just saying i trust the product since i trust the brand ive never had either of them underdeliver
DIY,not_removed,that might have been a long shot but i think its really reliable
DIY,not_removed,good work i cant wait to move out of an apartment to start doing my part with the bees
DIY,not_removed,this is awesome was there a pic of the metal rails with spacers ive never seen that before and i am intrigued love that you didnt sand off the name and contacted the son who helped build it
DIY,not_removed,please update us when you get the bees would love to see more pictures
DIY,not_removed,consider calling your local community gardens and seeing who would host your bees best piece of advice i can give you as a beginner is it is best to start with two hives that way you can compare hives to see if something is amiss and borrow things ie if your queen dies borrow brood from another hive so the other hive can generate a new one
DIY,not_removed,it is my obligation as op to deliver
DIY,not_removed,i shall
DIY,not_removed,seconded im wrapping up my first year and by all rights i should have lost my colony because i didnt have brood to replace the dead queen with im still a beekeeper purely by chance
DIY,not_removed,awesome thanks
DIY,not_removed,you learn more from your mistakes than your successes
DIY,not_removed,true but that would have been a very sad mistake
DIY,not_removed,perfect aftermarket item for any honda civic hatchback thats immediately the car i think of when i see this gear shift knob and i have no idea why my brain makes this association
DIY,not_removed,nice knob 😉 coincidentally we just took delivery of a coffee table made from skateboards wed seen it on this sub a while back and loved the patterns the skateboards provide
DIY,not_removed,thats fantastic what did you use to get the nice clear coat shine product and sanding materials very cool
DIY,not_removed,im waiting for the metapost where somebody makes a skateboard out of old skateboards kind of like the guy who made a pallet out of a pallet
DIY,not_removed,micarta is so cool and doing it with skateboards is even cooler tbh
DIY,not_removed,nice were you inspired by the guy who was making these a couple months ago and posted it in diy
DIY,not_removed,id never had guessed i wouldve thought it was a tigers eye stone
DIY,not_removed,thats a very nice shape not a basic at all i made also something from skateboards last year guitar
DIY,not_removed,pretty nice look personally i replaced my shift with a cap from a tequila bottle this one httpwwwgoodsipscomimagescontentrudojpg
DIY,not_removed,that does not look like it would be comfortable to use
DIY,not_removed,reminds me of fruitstripe gum awesome op
DIY,not_removed,i absolutely love this
DIY,not_removed,are there any yt channels or websites that teach you diy cos im only a teenager but i want to make stuff
DIY,not_removed,yup that is awesome
DIY,not_removed,not into skate boarding but this is pretty awesome very nicely done
DIY,not_removed,i want one
DIY,not_removed,that would go great in an old volvo
DIY,not_removed,nice great shape and finish with an awesome repurposing of material well done
DIY,not_removed,awfully confusing shift pattern though dude put in in blue red is for the highway aw crap put it in orange we gotta back up
DIY,not_removed,where did you get the piece to thread onto the shifter also did you just drilled out a hole and insert this piece i might try this due to wanting a knew knob in my
DIY,not_removed,where do you guys keep finding al those old skateboards
DIY,not_removed,dude thats sick im stealing this
DIY,not_removed,creating things out if old skateboards so hot right now this is cool though
DIY,not_removed,dudethats badass i would love one in my new to me grocerygogetter nice work
DIY,not_removed,followed you on instagram after the last thread still want a blue and white one or blue and wood colour
DIY,not_removed,i make jewelery out of old boards not as labour intensive as this though
DIY,not_removed,that looks cool im looking to make a shift knob for my roommate but was unsure of how to make the attachment point do you have any pictures of that process
DIY,not_removed,very nice what part of the board did you use thinking the concave wouldnt glue flush also what about the female thread how does this secure to the stick shift
DIY,not_removed,hows the comfort doesnt look too pleasant to hold also how much does temperature affect it i have my shift knob wrapped in a little crochet thing i made
DIY,not_removed,nice this reminds me of a video where the guy made a pen in similar fashion
DIY,not_removed,what did you use to insert threads on the base timesert helicoil or some type of wood insert
DIY,not_removed,i love your big knob
DIY,not_removed,nice kick flip the car
DIY,not_removed,as soon as those damn automated skateboards take over theres going to be a lot less broken skateboards to make these kinds of things
DIY,not_removed,looks amazing i really wanna try this now can you tell me how you cut the shape into your glued block of deck cuts i love how its on a diagonal and i want to try and imitate that
DIY,not_removed,this makes me want another manual
DIY,not_removed,do an ollie
DIY,not_removed,what a knob
DIY,not_removed,this is sick i have like old decks that i cant get rid of
DIY,not_removed,where does everybody get these skateboards
DIY,not_removed,for the win
DIY,not_removed,needs a bit more sanding looks cool though
DIY,not_removed,its in my old but it would fit a civic just as well haha
DIY,not_removed,or vw bus or early gtis
DIY,not_removed,i drive a civic hatch and the first thing i thought is how perfect this bad boy would look in my car
DIY,not_removed,i immediately thought golf kinda wacky and colorful way too classy for a civic
DIY,not_removed,or a volvo station wagon
DIY,not_removed,i dont remember posting httpsimgurcomgallerytfydt on here haha
DIY,not_removed,truoil from walmart its actually sold as a gun stock refinisher and sand down to steel wool
DIY,not_removed,its been httpirisskateboardscomproductcategorydecks
DIY,not_removed,not familiar with micarta and a google search confused me what is it
DIY,not_removed,im always inspired originally by a guy named haroshi but i follow a bunch of people that are recycling boards
DIY,not_removed,whoa never heard of it till now they do look very similar
DIY,not_removed,wow that guitar is sweet very nicely done
DIY,not_removed,awesome
DIY,not_removed,thats sweet looking
DIY,not_removed,just familiarize yourself with the tools and just start making stuff your stuff will be shitty at first but you will eventually get better
DIY,not_removed,i havent seen many specific to skateboards as a material but lots of woodworking in gerlneral if i make more i might try to film it
DIY,not_removed,on my truck it just has splines to keep it from spinning and its just pressed on its not moving
DIY,not_removed,these were ones i had laying around if you skate a bunch you can have a pretty good pile before you know it
DIY,not_removed,no pictures basically mine isnt threaded it just has splines to keep it from spinning so i drilled the hole where it would be snug and pressed it on if it were threaded i would probably do the same thing but thread it on hope this helps
DIY,not_removed,the part in between the middle bolt holes cut em up and puzzle pieces em together
DIY,not_removed,i wouldnt say its uncomfortable but not perfectly ergonomic either also i dont believe temperature will be an issue
DIY,not_removed,basically mine isnt threaded it just has splines to keep it from spinning so i drilled the hole where it would be snug and pressed it on if it were threaded i would probably do the same thing but thread it on hope this helps
DIY,not_removed,watch out those are painfully easy to steal dont even need tools you can start them just by twisting the ignition slot a few times it catches on the old ones
DIY,not_removed,how is golf fancier than civic
DIY,not_removed,those year old volvos are a whole fuckton of quality car for cheap you can get what was a car in excellent condition for like now nobody wants them because theyre not fuel efficient same reason old half ton pickups are waaaay cheaper than their ton counterparts of the same era
DIY,not_removed,haha wasnt yours but very nice all the same httpsimgurcomgalleryfvsff
DIY,not_removed,might i ask where you get all those old skateboards
DIY,not_removed,nice going to walmart tomorrow im inspired
DIY,not_removed,thanks for sharing i will be trying this out soon
DIY,not_removed,that looks really nice compared to what i would typically expect from a walmart finish
DIY,not_removed,clicked on the link hoping it was to iris skateboards was not disappointed
DIY,not_removed,essentially layers of material bonded by resin or plastic its usually made with fabric but other materials are still considered micarta httpsenwikipediaorgwikimicarta i guess this isnt really micarta since you didnt set it with plastic or resin but it looks like it lol
DIY,not_removed,nice man they look really cool and i hope you continue making them next step is to make a coffee table out of them
DIY,not_removed,ty
DIY,not_removed,im not sure the same would work for me as im planning on casting mine out of resin but thanks for the reply
DIY,not_removed,thanks for the heads up
DIY,not_removed,thanks for the tip hey op where do you park at night
DIY,not_removed,my old ford could be started with anything you could fit into key hole on the ignition i started it with a coin on several occasions if my friends ever saw my car parked anywhere they would immediately move it good times
DIY,not_removed,le euro
DIY,not_removed,classic golfs are classy even the newer ones have a wacky way about them that pays tribute to the original the seats steering wheel gear knob the japanese are much too serious to do anything like that
DIY,not_removed,oh definitely theyre bulletproof too they last over miles easy
DIY,not_removed,that is some very nice work i especially like the inlaid corners very cool
DIY,not_removed,nice eboy piece
DIY,not_removed,damn that is amazing
DIY,not_removed,like aviation composites
DIY,not_removed,i see now very cool
DIY,not_removed,denim micarta is easily the coolest
DIY,not_removed,actually i made a httpsimgurcomgallerytfydt about years ago
DIY,not_removed,yw practice makes perfect
DIY,not_removed,yo mommas
DIY,not_removed,i could imagine the jokes going out and not finding the car
DIY,not_removed,did this to my friends bronco in high school and it never got oldfor us
DIY,not_removed,savage
DIY,not_removed,i am from a really small town so it was never more than a couple of minuets of oh my god my car is gone before i would find it also a small enough town that if any of the police saw someone else in my car other than me they would have stopped the car
DIY,not_removed,i can imagine good times
DIY,not_removed,langstroth sorry misspelled the title p
DIY,not_removed,cool design but without the black and white squares or at least two different colors it loses some functionality
DIY,not_removed,should have built a cyvasse board
DIY,not_removed,what about the pieces
DIY,not_removed,thank you i agree about the functionality i think im going to stain every other square not completely covering the picture but just setting them apart
DIY,not_removed,haha yes next time
DIY,not_removed,it is a little difficult for my to conceptualize what is happening without a few pictures or drawings but i will make an attempt to answer your question what you are really trying to do is divert water around the slab rather than running under it you need to provide an easier path for water to travel than under this is normally accomplished with a footing drain excavate down adjacent next to the slab and install a perforated drain tile and backfill with porous backfill put enough slope on the tile as is it running around the outside of the building so that water will flow if there is enough slope on the downhill side of the building you can simply daylight the drain tile if there isnt enough slope you can discharge the water into a wet well so that it will infiltrate into the surrounding soil worst case if the soil conditions cant support infiltration you could install a sump pump in the wet well and discharge far away from the building
DIY,not_removed,sorry if unclear its not a slab its a standard perimeter foundation but one poured without a footing im not just looking to divert the water but adding the proper inground stabilization that would be needed for a perimeter foundation use this as reference but without the subterranean part of the foundation surface perimeter pours like i am dealing with were common back before we figured out they were a bad idea the guy who built this building while building it in modern times early was an old fella used to doing things the old way so im proposing to add that footer without removing the old foundation because i cant afford it thusly im worried about failure because when i was poking at the dirt around and under the foundation its all powder soft i have no idea what is holding it up to be honest there must be spots where there is tremendous load because in the areas i poked at i could compress the dirt under the foundation with my fingers bad idea for some soil types which i have
DIY,not_removed,now i understand i dont see much of that style of construction in the midwest most buildings in my part of the country are full concrete slabs poured on grade or buildings with basements its pretty rare to see a building with a crawl space around here the footing drain still applies if that was a full depth footing it would be outfitted with a drain tile on the outside to divert water away the trick with a footing drain is using the proper backfill material and making sure there is adequate slope to move water i usually consider per foot to be the minimum slope for footing drains edit as i mentioned i am in the midwest so i dont have a lot of experience with spread footings poured on grade like that in my part of the country any footing at all has to be buried at least below grade to be below the frost line underpinning a footing that large the way you described in or op sounds like a hell of a lot of work but it may be the right thing to do regardless of the drainage if it were me i would take on the extra work and redo the entire footing
DIY,not_removed,thankfully no frost line to worry about out here just trying to get deep wide enough for the soil conditions around here thats generally down with a footing i would love to replace the whole pour but like i said im probably two years out saving every penny ive got in order to afford that sort of job the entire while it could go and fail on me that and that would be a lot of money to spend on a nonresidential building but i can afford a shovel and of concrete rebar every few weeks ive toyed with excavating out an entire side at a time but i think that would leave the building up on temporary blocks for months bc while i could do it have access to a bobcat and a backhoe i just dont have the time to build the forms the rebar cages etc all at once day job means i can work on stabilizing things on weekends i thought about doing it in say sections but them im trying to marry my structural foundation every ive not had a lot of luck getting good adherence between pours in the past the benefit of the saddles is that im not disrupting the obviouslyfunctioning existing foundation and even if they dont all bond perfectly it doesnt matter as much i dont think and yeah i am putting in a french drain which should work like footing drain once the footings are actually there p

DIY,not_removed,not entirely sure i was initially thinking knee height but then it will be to heavy and i will waste too much on the materials maybe half of that or a bit less for proportions i was thinking about making a minotaur crouching sorry if that isnt too helpful im terrible at guessing sizes
DIY,not_removed,neat project cool execution
DIY,not_removed,i bet all that clicking must sound awesome
DIY,not_removed,i remember really liking this at university it brings me back also helps me to appreciate how far everything has come its mind boggling
DIY,not_removed,i dont understand why this needs to exist but i like it
DIY,not_removed,you can get a glimpse of it in the video at the end but its better in reality
DIY,not_removed,glad you like it i also got my incentive for doing this project in a university course on technical computer science in my opinion relays are the best way to make logic gates easy to understand also i just like their mechanical look feel and sound
DIY,not_removed,sounds so nice also is that a chopping block its mounted on love it
DIY,not_removed,yep sanded and oiled chopping block

DIY,not_removed,super cool i have to make my girlfriend a new bed frame soon so i clicked this to get some ideas i really love how the headboard looks definitely saving for future reference
DIY,not_removed,just a random plane in his garage nbd
DIY,not_removed,love this its got a cabin in the woods feel
DIY,not_removed,the extra wood could be used as a nightstand to match the headboard
DIY,not_removed,oblig up vote for oblig last photo first
DIY,not_removed,nice design beautiful wood just one thing you said time to rip some aluminum to size but ripping is cutting along the length of an object the more you know
DIY,not_removed,nice job for doweling next time you can do something really simple take a block of wood about an inch or so thick about the same length as the bed rail is wide and mark a horizontal and vertical center line mark the locations of the holes for the dowels on the jig and drill them mark the horizontal and vertical center lines on the rails and the posts orient the center lines on the jig to line up with the center lines on the rails and posts and drill your holes perfectly simple and repeatable source i just finished a bed build last year and thats what i did
DIY,not_removed,i like that printposter of the mountain behind your bed could you tell me where you purchased it from
DIY,not_removed,this looks awesome great job and what a wonderful dad you have
DIY,not_removed,nice work what did the maple slab cost
DIY,not_removed,is that the nose of a plane in the background holy shit it is edit i have seen a plane before i was just dumbfounded it was chilling in your dads garage lol
DIY,not_removed,wait i live in bothell anyways how much were the wood slabs
DIY,not_removed,this is relatable currently working on a steel and live edge wood bed frame for my lady friend as well
DIY,not_removed,yeah its a hangar we built before he built the plane whie it is a big deal but not the subject of the post
DIY,not_removed,minds think alike
DIY,not_removed,kinda one issue in our project was that the piece was too long to put under the drill press making keeping the drill orthogonal to the wood an issue your method would likely solve the locating problem but after a hole or two that guide hole is going to be larger than the drill and allow for slop any of which wouldnt allow for perfect joinery right what was your experience like
DIY,not_removed,
DIY,not_removed,big ones
DIY,not_removed,varied in price mine was but you could go up to it was beautiful
DIY,not_removed,the bed frame looks wonderful you did an excellent job i made a few myself but nothing this nice or creative
DIY,not_removed,all good concerns one issue in our project was that the piece was too long to put under the drill press making keeping the drill orthogonal to the wood an issue one problem with most doweling jigs is that there isnt enough material on the jig to support the drill bit to insure that the drill is orthogonal for anyone wondering orthogonal is just a fancy way to say that the drill bit is at a degree angle to the wood for most doweling thats not that much of an issue because most dowels arent that long so the amount of error introduced is acceptable by using a thicker piece of wood for the jig you provide more support for the drill so that it is easier to insure the drill and wood are orthogonal for my jig i used a piece that was thick and didnt have any problems that leads to your second concernslop introduced because of the drill bit enlarging the hole in the jig when it is used a good way to reduce slop is to drill the hole in the jig oversize and insert a metal tube with an interior diameter the same size as the drill bit i didnt do that because the number of holes i was drilling wasnt that many there wasnt enough error to be visible to the naked eye what my end product looked like for the side rail and what it looked like in the post i used a hidden bed bolt system so it was very important to get that middle hole perfectly aligned every time so that the recess for the bolt would line up perfectly and it did you dont always need an expensive jig to get great results httpimgurcomasfcpi the completed project httpimgurcomaqfgar the full build album long just to warn you to give you an idea for what i had to deal with
DIY,not_removed,thanks i will get something from there
DIY,not_removed,a good way to reduce slop is to drill the hole in the jig oversize and insert a metal tube with an interior diameter the same size as the drill bit i didnt do that because the number of holes i was drilling wasnt that many there wasnt enough error to be visible to the naked eye thats the ticket what a great solution your project looks great thanks for the advice
DIY,not_removed,contact the town i had the same problem in a house i had they repaved the road and it brought the surface above the previous grade and every time it rained it would wash my drive way out i had them come back and form a curb to divert the water to the ditch on either side of the driveway for your lawn you may need someone to bring a tractor with a subsoiler huge pick that opens up sub surface soil to open up the soil under the lawn to help it drain take pictures too
DIY,not_removed,pictures with something for scale would help
DIY,not_removed,buy a plastic laundry bucket hamper weight it down with a rock or put the pump in leaves get strained out by the basket rocks hold the pump above the muck
DIY,not_removed,we have a similar issue the gutter has tilted in so water sits on our hell strip from the street side the sidewalk is also tilted so water pools up on that side the previous homeowners put a work order in with the city and we did as well its been about years total and it doesnt look like the city is fixing it anytime soon were actually having our lawn regraded due to some flooding issues in the garage and in the process our landscape crew is going to make a little retaining wall of bricks to block the water is it possible to do something like that at least for the lawn could you install a channel drain in your driveway please post picture preferably with a banana for scale
DIY,not_removed,a pump is a temporary fix you really need to regrade your driveway or lawn to drain the water away
DIY,not_removed,drill holes in the bottom sides of a gallon bucket and put pump inside allows water in but not the trash
DIY,not_removed,possibly make a small hump at the end of your drive way with some concrete to reduce the amount of water that runs off onto it

DIY,not_removed,ill certainly try the town but i dont know what they are willing to do been this way for a couple years but now its just getting really bad ill try and get some pics tonight after work if its not too dark
DIY,not_removed,just moved into a house that had the foundation lifted concrete at the lip of the garage was already a little high so now any water that seeps in from god knows where cant escape with the slope of the rest of the garage
DIY,not_removed,this lived in a house once with this issue instead of redoing the entire driveway we put a hump at the bottom and that kept the water in the street and heading toward the drain instead of our driveway it was not ideal but better than waiting for the town to drag their feet forever
DIY,not_removed,they should actually be required to fix it since their raising the driveway caused the issue in the first place there are multiple ways to repave the most common is just to add material on top but you can only do that so many times before you run into this issue or find that the curbs arent high enough for code when you get too high theyll instead cut that material out and add material from there everyone hates pulling the old layers out because its more expensive but you need to do it every few times bottom line though is they modified the roads affecting flooding of your property theyre responsible for fixing the issue take that stance with them and make them fix it if need be get one of their people on site to walk the site with you if they hem and haw about not wanting to do anything tell them that since they caused the issue if theyre not willing to fix it the next call will be to a lawyer who will sue them for the repairs as well as your legal fees theyll move quick citiesutilities are weird about this type of thing they never want to take responsibility we had a bee hive in one of the cable boxes on our property called the cable company told them to fix it they said it was our problem conversation ended like this me great one moment while i set the phone line to record them why do you want to record it me because youve just said its my problem that means that i need to call a bee guy and he needs to remove the beehive currently sitting in your utility box its likely that in the removal of the bees hes going to screw up the cable box for the entire block im going to record you giving me permission to open up the utility box owned by you and to fix the problem myself as youve asked when your boss tells me i need to pay for the repairs im going to play the recording for him they had someone out the next day

DIY,not_removed,what about metal roofing it comes precoloured and you should be able to find something that complements your siding i was at a friends cabin recently and he used this installed vertically instead of siding and it looked great
DIY,not_removed,i have read all the rules and read and the options how much more specific do i need to get i stated what i am doing what i have done and the different direction i would like to take my project to complete it and am looking for products and methods to do it
DIY,not_removed,i google seattle maker spaces and found several they probably have all of the tools you need to make the nipples on your own you only need a pipe threader and something that will cut the the pipes which could be so many tools you can probably rent the tools from big box stores as well
DIY,not_removed,i dunno but it sounds kinky

DIY,not_removed,thanks for the suggestion im checking this out
DIY,not_removed,thanks ill check them out
DIY,not_removed,get some kilz primer and seal the floor even if you follow steps unless you seal the floor any other animal who goes into that house will smell the urine and try to cover it
DIY,not_removed,ive had this problem before with a plywood subfloor but the idea is the same dry the concrete coat it with oilbased killz and youre good
DIY,not_removed,jeyes fluid
DIY,not_removed,
DIY,not_removed,clean and seal
DIY,not_removed,use the enzyme cleaner first then the vinegar the enzymes may not work if introduced to an overly acidic surface then seal it with a kilz primer as others have recommended
DIY,not_removed,zinsser bin works great should be able to find it pretty easily
DIY,not_removed,you should check the drywall as well and removereplace any that has wicked up urine and id be so tempted to look up those tenants on spokeo public data et al and send their parents a friendly letter not demanding any payment unless they cosigned just letting them know the condition you found your property in its one thing to ignore a letter from the landlord you ditched but when your mom gives you an earful it can make a difference
DIY,not_removed,use the oil version and not the latex version of kilz you can also use all purpose oil base floor and utility enamel from lowes but its high gloss and will hold up a little better than kilz if you want to leave any of it exposed kilz will dry much faster than enamel if you have a lot of floor to do id suggest using an roller instead of a
DIY,not_removed,odor abatement is what kilz was engineered for there is no equal i have found
DIY,not_removed,i appreciate the response but im reading online that its for outdoor use only do you have any experience using it indoors
DIY,not_removed,white vinegar
DIY,not_removed,im pretty sure that is illegal under the fair debt collection practices act unless they cosigned
DIY,not_removed,this is the correct answer
DIY,not_removed,also agree here from personal experience this is the way to go
DIY,not_removed,using it sucks that shit stinks but nothing works better accept no substitute
DIY,not_removed,i used it inside my house when we first bought it nasty fixer upper and it works great youre covering it up anywaysjust make sure you have fresh air its stinky
DIY,not_removed,right which is why unless they cosigned dont mention money just send em a letter letting them know the condition little johnny left your property in its probably still illegal but its cathartic to imagine
DIY,not_removed,how much did the raw materials cost
DIY,not_removed,loving the look and the workmanship is real nice but the design includes the one flaw that bugs me every time i see it the handle is attached to the top only it doesnt go through the top and into the bag itself as a result all the weight of the stuff in the bag is being transmitted to the two buckles holding the flap down and theyll eventually misshape or fail mens messenger bags and especially briefcases do this all the time bugs me sorry for the negativity you should be really proud of what youve made of course
DIY,not_removed,i cant wait to see the patina that will develop beautiful craftsmanship
DIY,not_removed,the thing thats most annoying about this and all diy projects is that by making it perfect people will not be as impressed by it as they should be because it looks machine made i took a blacksmithing class a few years ago and the teacher was very upset over having to do a less perfect job than hes capable of just so people would know his stuff was handmade in case it seems like im insulting you or your briefcase i want to make clear that im saying you did an amazing job and it looks great edited to make it sound a little better
DIY,not_removed,thats beautiful
DIY,not_removed,the carrying strap being held on by only those screws seems like a serious weak point to me maybe throw some stitching in there but otherwise good job
DIY,not_removed,op first nice bag dont let the rest of what im going to say overshadow that that said this thing has a lot of issues you need to finish that leather at least oil it up with some neatsfoot oil or another leather preservative it really should have been oil dyed before construction finish your edges nothing is skived or slicked and thats really amateur hour man this thing youre doing where youre using chicago screws everywhere is a bad idea theyre great for fitup and testing but unless you superglueloctite them or check them regularly and tighten them theyre going to slowly unscrew you need to use copper rivets and burrs at those loadbearing points anyway theres more but addressing that stuff will go a long ways towards making a bag that discerning people will appreciate good job op
DIY,not_removed,this is fantastic i really wish i could find some leatherworking classes near me id love to try something like this myself
DIY,not_removed,what was the total cost
DIY,not_removed,wow man amazing work would be nice to post a update to rwellworn in a couple months a year
DIY,not_removed,tandy briefcase kit not cheep ive made one myself just remember to regularly condition the bag
DIY,not_removed,this is beautiful the step by step pictures have me interested in this as a hobby for myself now
DIY,not_removed,httpswwwtandyleathercomenproductexpeditionbriefcasekit
DIY,not_removed,dont want to subtract from how great this looks great work kind of want one haha but my understanding is that the only leather here that is fullgrain is the tan straps the white leather looks too thin to be fullgrain perhaps only topgrain not trying to be critical this is just something im generally curious about
DIY,not_removed,in your experience with leather is the groove and hand stitching the best approach for individual projects ive just started to venture into heavier weight materials denim and light leathers and have found that even after making adjustments to my sewing machine and using the heavier weighted needles recommended for the material that the likely hood of broken needles is still high and that the regular stopping and starting has compromised the overall look and depending on the seamjoint the integrity of the project the case looks awesome if you have any tips youd like to share or some of your favorite tools or resources for purchasing materials id love to hear them
DIY,not_removed,did you buy this as a kit or make it from scratch looks amazing
DIY,not_removed,this is really nice and looks super fancy great job
DIY,not_removed,beautiful work i personally would prefer a darker color instead of white but hell it looks fabulous
DIY,not_removed,is this your work op like for realsies if so do you have any suggestions on a notsocostly kit and where to get the right leather i have wanted to make my own motorcycle saddlebags for a long time now great work btw
DIY,not_removed,do you have images of how you stitch you punched holes and then there was a finished seam i believe that was hand stitched would love to see how you got t the stitches done
DIY,not_removed,i just came here to tell you that this is awesome
DIY,not_removed,where do you buy the leather is there somewhere online i could order it
DIY,not_removed,can i edit my imgur link to include text updates anyway edit people have been asking about starting up the hobby here are some very basic tools to get you started on simple things like bracelets belts wallets notebooks etc rotary cutter along with a metal ruler this is a must you need to be able to cut straight lines used in nearly of all projects httpswwwtandyleathercomenproducteasygriprotarycutter rotary punch httpswwwtandyleathercomenproducteconomyrotaryleatherpunch punch set alternative to the rotary punch allows you to punch holes farther from the edge of a piece of leather httpswwwtandyleathercomenproductminileatherpunchset snaprivet setter httpswwwtandyleathercomenproductsnapallsnapsetterset diamond chisel for punching holes for stitching httpswwwtandyleathercomenproductdiamondholechiselset wax thread needle httpswwwtandyleathercomenproductstitchingneedles groover httpswwwtandyleathercomenproductcraftooladjustablegroover oblong punch for making belt buckles possible httpswwwtandyleathercomenproductcraftooloblongpunches leather screws buttons snaps buckles etc can be bought as needed edit people are wondering about the color and aging process the leather will naturally tan over time towards the darker brown most people are accustomed to seeing when it comes to leather the sun water and oils from your skin contribute to the patina that develops heres an example of a wallet i made brand new compared to year of use httpimgurcomaillko
DIY,not_removed,that made in texas is a goode co pecan pie box if anyone was wondering
DIY,not_removed,posts like this make me wish i had the time and the space to take up leatherworking
DIY,not_removed,thats so cute me and my girlfriends would love to have one like that
DIY,not_removed,will you add a finish i would highly recommend it the first bit of liquid food or oil that touches your beautiful leather will leave a stain id do a light coat of neatsfoot oil and once thats drysoaked in work in a layer of dubbin i make mine out of beeswax lard and neatsfoot oil but you can busy premade stuff it will seem weird and sort of sticky at first but after a couple of days it will cure into a nice wax finish that will repel water it will darken the colour somewhat so definitely test it on scrap first
DIY,not_removed,i want one gorgeous work
DIY,not_removed,damn thats sexy
DIY,not_removed,damn fine craftsmanship good job
DIY,not_removed,thats very pretty op i want one
DIY,not_removed,this is really cool
DIY,not_removed,that is absolutely gorgeous
DIY,not_removed,master
DIY,not_removed,very nice how much experiencetutelage did you have before attempting this
DIY,not_removed,that looks super nice
DIY,not_removed,gorgeous
DIY,not_removed,i would definitly buy this
DIY,not_removed,great job ❣️💼❣️
DIY,not_removed,this is gorgeous op
DIY,not_removed,how much did the materials cost and where do you purchase the material from i have no clue but why but i would seriously take this up as a hobby
DIY,not_removed,neat how much was your total material cost
DIY,not_removed,beautiful if you want to make it last get a gallon of neatsfoot oil and a big pan and just soak the thing for three days in oil wipe it down completely let dry for another days to soak in as it is the leather is suuuuper dry and will begin to crack far more easily without oil
DIY,not_removed,well thats attractive
DIY,not_removed,i want one now
DIY,not_removed,huge fan of veg tan here that thing is gonna age beautifully
DIY,not_removed,looks like you modeled the bag after saddleback leather briefcases
DIY,not_removed,not sure if anyone has said this but you should make a video showing your work true craftsmanship is hard to come by watching someone who is great at what they do doing it is such a great way to pass the time
DIY,not_removed,love it needs to be broken in by running it over with a truck
DIY,not_removed,wow thats beautiful love the design
DIY,not_removed,the irony you work at a briefcase factory but never have a use for a briefcaseseriously beautiful work i like the colors and i feel that a work of this quality will probably be around in years if taken care of properly really nice highend elegant work
DIY,not_removed,that two tone bag is really nice op if some of the advice in the thread were applied such as a nice cloth liner burnished edges and sturdier hardware id commission you to make me a bag been looking for something like this for a while pm me if you want to make another one
DIY,not_removed,i love the look of this very informative i have wanted something like this for a long time but i could not scrape up the money to buy one i might have to give this a go and try my hand at making one thank you for sharing
DIY,not_removed,this is beautiful and honestly im madly in love with the twotone with that said being totally inexperienced with leather work im taking a lot of notes from the comments for when i eventually try making something like this so interesting
DIY,not_removed,oh goodness thats gorgeous would you think someone whos never built a messenger bag could get something acceptable on the first try any smaller project i should take on first to learn the skills i need
DIY,not_removed,thats beautiful
DIY,not_removed,now scratch it all over with your fingernails j peterman catalog readers
DIY,not_removed,i would love to buy one black with red leather trim do you have any idea how much youd charge very interested its absolutely beautiful
DIY,not_removed,indiana jones called he wants his briefcase back 😜 really though great work if i ever wanted to get into leather working basics what are the essentials
DIY,not_removed,ive been interested in leather working but dont know where to get the tools or materials does anyone have suggestions as to where to look online
DIY,not_removed,nice case looks like it will last forever i look forward to a future post when it has a nice patina
DIY,not_removed,how much would it cost me to have you make me a leather duffle bag im a huge fan of leather but the price of a hand crafted high quality leather bag is just too high for a college student
DIY,not_removed,gator boots in my pimped out gucci suits
DIY,not_removed,post some pics of the patina down the road i bet its gonna look great nice work
DIY,not_removed,wow c o n g r a t u l a t i o n s
DIY,not_removed,i just assumed at first that it was a really well done cake
DIY,not_removed,first rate work
DIY,not_removed,amazing work of crafting
DIY,not_removed,that is gorgeous i can almost smell the leather
DIY,not_removed,no bull about it thats a fine piece of work there
DIY,not_removed,looks like the health case from wolfenstein
DIY,not_removed,oh my god this is my taste if you ever start selling these you should start selling these
DIY,not_removed,what does full grain mean
DIY,not_removed,i dont like how light it is i know nothing about how the coloring of leather works but this looks kinda pink
DIY,not_removed,is this some sort of kit the leather looks precut and you dont show your measuring or cutting process at all
DIY,not_removed,u should sell this on etsy or something
DIY,not_removed,first and foremost gorgeous while i am particular on what i like in a bag this is a stunning piece of craftsmanship since it is the first you made i wouldnt dare ask to purchase it you have talent i love the simple yet classy look of the bag i do agree about the liner however it is simply a case of aesthetics i think if one has a bag of this quality i would lost assuredly ensure that the leather was protected but that is the owners choice and can do it themselves im sure all future endeavors will be just fine
DIY,not_removed,cant help but think how quickly thats going to get ruined but i drink a lot of grape juice like a lot its a problem and i often keep juice boxes in my briefcase
DIY,not_removed,handmade as in you dealt away with the animal yourself too but it looks rad id wear it haha especially in a darker version
DIY,not_removed,fuck leather
DIY,not_removed,where does someone get raw leather like this i have no experience in leather work but would love to get started
DIY,not_removed,lots of people asking how much the materials cost what about the tools needed how much did they cost is there a good place with a list of the tools needed etc
DIY,not_removed,just a life or twodont worry they were just dumb cows
DIY,not_removed,first thing its a handsome bag op got style gonna constructively hop on if op wanted to improve their leather working efforts in the future i suggest burnishing the edges giving them a polished look and also adding a cloth inner liner to bags which are meant to be frequently used they can catch the oil and crumbs that will eventually come leave the liner unattached at the bottom so that you can flip it out to easily get rid of the dirt inside
DIY,not_removed,yeah i definitely went back and forth on this in my head in the end i decided to just attach it on the outside as an aesthetic preference however i did design the bag to allow for further modding including switching over to a handle that goes through the top
DIY,not_removed,i have one that the top handle attaches to the body and the flap has a slit that allows to grasp the handle through it solves that issue bag is from buffalo outfitters or something like that
DIY,not_removed,i have a coach briefcase that is this exact style the handle is only attached to the top it failed albeit after years of use but i agree that attachment to the body would be a design improvement
DIY,not_removed,i wouldnt consider this negative its a great and constructive comment meant to further ops ability in a hobby its really great im sure he is grateful for the input have a wonderful day and christmas season as a whole
DIY,not_removed,i have also thought the same thing and have been surprised at how the buckles do just fine over the long term i think they do that because weather and other undesirables could get in by making a hole at the top unless you over complicated with an underflap also carrying a huge amount of weight suggests you need a different type of bag anyway edit sick bag op
DIY,not_removed,how would you manage the design to attach the handle to the body of the bag any alternative i can think of would result in either awkward cramps in the leather or rainfunnels in the lid
DIY,not_removed,for even more feedback and knowledge take it over to rleathercraft
DIY,not_removed,i think whats really going to happen here is that the shoulder strap will be used of the time
DIY,not_removed,i will rebuttal by saying he used rivets which is a very secure it should last you longer than just stitching the leather handle inside the bag source i worked at saddleback leather and helped make thousands of leather products they even have a lifetime guarantee on their products so they are all about quality
DIY,not_removed,can you give and example like a link to a photo id love to make something like this in the future
DIY,not_removed,i absolutely agree about the handle attachment it is a small annoyance and a critique one only learns after having a brief like this
DIY,not_removed,harsh but fair
DIY,not_removed,ill create another post in a year
DIY,not_removed,not sure you ever will
DIY,not_removed,i get the sentiment but on the other hand if we can make something by machine and its the same quality it better than hand made theres not much of a problem usually there are things you can do with handmade goods that arent possible to scale yet which makes the hand made product special
DIY,not_removed,how weird i would make things as well as i could so that i have a great looking quality product who gives a shit if it doesnt look handmade except for maybe the ego because the topic will be brought up more often if it does including something like your name or initials depending on the size of the object hidden on the inside on the object would be an option to prove that you made it i guess
DIY,not_removed,if you are a selling your crafts from a shelf you are right otherwise you are wrong heres why if you are selling custom made crafts made in agreement with a customer sure they will be impressed by a perfect looking object if you are crafting for yourself its because the object can be bought in the desired shape or quality lack of general interest will be outweighed by the impressed looks from the select few who asks where you bought it
DIY,not_removed,ill take that as a compliment though there are a number of quality issues with it as many have already pointed out in this thread lol
DIY,not_removed,i never really finish any of my leather just because i like beating them up and letting them develop a nice patina overtime i condition them from time to time would most finishes affect the aging process i will finish them later was lazy and just excited to post im still going to be modding it in the coming daysweeks adding pockets and modular compartments inside the screws are temporary im going to be opening it all up again to continue to add things inside the bag once im happy to close out the project ill either glue them or replace them with rivets thanks for the input
DIY,not_removed,in ops defense those saddleback bags arent skiived either i like the raw edge look actually skived and unslicked is my personal favorite agreed on the other points though
DIY,not_removed,oil dyed that makes no sense i agree with finishing it but if he wanted a plain veg tan brief case why would he dye it something like obenaufs lp would condition and seal without the need of oils or dyes
DIY,not_removed,come join us in rleathercraft you can find everything you need to knowpurchase there
DIY,not_removed,ill condition the leather when needed otherwise i like letting my leather goods age naturally itll develop a nice patina turning more brown over time scuffs dirt and water stains are all part of it but theyre also less noticeable as the leather gets darker
DIY,not_removed,i guess it depends on your desired result some people love to patina natural vegetable tanned leather like this unless the leather is already drycracking oil treatment isnt necessarily needed it will as you say pick a lot of dirt and water stains the idea is that eventually the whole bag will darken and theyll become a part of a larger patina
DIY,not_removed,yeah i dont get why op did this with totally raw leather its gonna get real grody real fast
DIY,not_removed,totally ill make another post in a year to show how its aged i expected it to be much darker and with a few new mods
DIY,not_removed,not cheep or cheap
DIY,not_removed,cool i left a comment elsewhere which should give you an idea of necessary tools and startup costs
DIY,not_removed,i see the reasoning saddleback is able to sell theirs for
DIY,not_removed,full grain means that the outermost layer grain is intact and unaltered when leather is split portions that are thinned are taken from the flesh inside side so it is still possible for a leather to be thin and full grain top grain means the surface grain has been corrected or altered in some way it is entirely possible to split full grain leather
DIY,not_removed,i bought the leather more than a year ago so im not sure but it definitely had blemishesscars on it i obviously used very clean portions it is pretty thin though
DIY,not_removed,you rarely use a standard sewing machine on leather i dont know anyone who does they are just not strong enough
DIY,not_removed,the saddle stitch found in hand stitched leather goods is the strongest stitch you can use its the preferrable approach for every leather project
DIY,not_removed,yeah ive always hand stitched my leather goods its a pain but it looks so awesome especially when you cut a groove into the leather first but because its such a pain i avoid projects with a ton of stitching or find ways to use rivets instead
DIY,not_removed,there are kits but i did this from scratch taking cues from existing bags
DIY,not_removed,it will naturally darkentan over time towards the more traditional leather color youre probably accustomed too
DIY,not_removed,no such thing best bet is to haunt the leather sale subredits and pick up scraps got a side of cxl for kits will always be expensive and small size purchases will be too
DIY,not_removed,i left a comment elsewhere which should give you an idea of necessary tools and startup costs as for leather i usually wait for sales to come around on tandyleatherfactorycom i probably used about sale worth of really nice leather to make this
DIY,not_removed,needles figure its called a saddle stitch
DIY,not_removed,yeah sorry i have adhd and kept forgetting to take pics along the way especially while using both hands to stitch ill try to add a photo of example stitching later
DIY,not_removed,i specifically came to the comments to see if anyone else recognized that box i have one of the longer ones under my office desk as we speak
DIY,not_removed,thats exactly what it was the pecan pie omg
DIY,not_removed,this was the first thing i noticed probably one of the best pecan pies out there
DIY,not_removed,i started messing with leather a little under years ago made a few wallets and notebooks and a ton of belts for friends and family just something i did in my spare time which doesnt add up to much experience i feel like i have good design sense but i still totally lucked out on this project maybe because i thought about it so much on and off over the course of a year
DIY,not_removed,i left a comment above which should give you an idea of startup costs as for leather i usually wait for sales to come around i probably used about sale worth of really nice leather to make this
DIY,not_removed,i left a comment above which should give you an idea of startup costs as for leather i usually wait for sales to come around i probably used about sale worth of really nice leather to make this
DIY,not_removed,whoah whoah you can overoil leather particularly vegtan leather like this will wetform if you soak it plus the fibers can swell from the excess moisture and that significantly weakens the hide nothing wrong with a little swipeyswipey to apply neatsfoot i would have done it before assembly but hey
DIY,not_removed,probably pretty standard design for a leather briefcase i took design cues from multiple bags not sure if i stumbled on a saddleback one
DIY,not_removed,i was going to stream it on twitch creative but forgot
DIY,not_removed,thats why i got into leatherworking because i wanted those boutique wallets and belts but they are pretty expensive
DIY,not_removed,ive been doing simple things like wallets belts and notebooks for a couple of years learned a lot from doing that this is a relatively simple bag in that i didnt incorporate any new techniques i hadnt already used on wallets and belts i knew to work within my skillset also im somewhat of a designer by profession could a first timer accomplish it maybe but i wouldnt recommend it
DIY,not_removed,ill get to it eventually
DIY,not_removed,i left a comment above which should give you an idea of necessary tools and startup costs tutorials on youtube are particularly helpful and i dont even mean diy videos for every tool i bought i looked up tutorials on how to use it properly which surprisingly taught me a ton about the basics then i used that knowledge to create things i wanted of my own design i never had to create an item off of a youtube video
DIY,not_removed,i left a comment above which should give you an idea of necessary tools and startup costs as for leather i usually wait for sales to come around i probably used about sale worth of really nice leather to make this
DIY,not_removed,come join us in rleathercraft you can find everything you need to knowpurchase there
DIY,not_removed,i used to support saddleback pretty hardcore but i just cant get behind their recent price increases some of the items nearly doubled in price they are still great products but i cant justify that price anymore
DIY,not_removed,black and blue
DIY,not_removed,yeah its skin tone it will naturally darken over time towards the traditional brown leather color youre probably more accustomed to leather only gets finer with age like wine
DIY,not_removed,lol they certainly arent precut you can see the random rolls in one of the first photos also if you look carefully nothing really lines up perfectly as i did everything with a single ruler i could really use a protractor
DIY,not_removed,yeah i used pair of household scissors xd
DIY,not_removed,haha yeah while its really lightcolored right now stains are scary but as it brownsdarkens over time dirt and stains will be less of a big deal
DIY,not_removed,youre a purse
DIY,not_removed,leather is a byproduct of the meat industry if we didnt make stuff out of it itd just get thrown away
DIY,not_removed,httpswwwtandyleathercomen to start but there are cheaper and far higher quality suppliers available if you want to work leather with regularity
DIY,not_removed,on rleathercraft they have a good list of suppliers httpswwwredditcomrleathercraftwikiindexwikisuppliers tandy leather is regarded as low quality on that sub by many of the regulars
DIY,not_removed,agreed im just getting started with leatherworking but in my opinion neglecting to burnish the edges is like skipping the sanding step in any woodworking project
DIY,not_removed,i have a bag with the liner tearing out its an italian leather purse i nabbed at goodwill for do you know who i could take it to to get it replaced where would i even begin to look
DIY,not_removed,couldnt an unattached liner get annoying pulling stuff out and the liner comes along with it or just getting in the way when looking for things my bag is very much like this one and completely unlined i dont really have any problems with dirt even after a solid year of use on the other hand a liner would look pretty nifty
DIY,not_removed,does that mean your stuff gets wet in the rain
DIY,not_removed,thankyou for taking the time to write that the world needs niceness more than ever i shall try force my cold black heart to pass it forward
DIY,not_removed,agreed
DIY,not_removed,i used to work in an office and used a cheap briefcase with the described flaw to cart around paper files which get pretty heavy but all the weight went to the one cheap combination lock clasp and once the lock breaks the bags useless it cant be closed or carried i couldve used something more robust but paper files shouldnt destroy briefcases other than hiding your packed lunch away from the fridgethief thats what theyre for
DIY,not_removed,thanks yeah at most im carrying a surface pro or inch macbook neither of which are very heavy charger a few files business cards a ps vita random nick knacks etc the plus side is that mods and maintenancerepairs are easy since i made it for myself
DIY,not_removed,heres one or handle goes through the flap like a pilots case or er magnets
DIY,not_removed,what if the handle wrapped around and came down the sides of the bag
DIY,not_removed,oh hey friend
DIY,not_removed,i posted a link further up currently in the comments although it isnt great googling pilot cases will do the trick essentially any design that has a big flap will have the issue unless you put a hole in it remove the flap and theres lots of options
DIY,not_removed,remindme year
DIY,not_removed,agree that doesnt even look oiled its going to pick up every bit of crap and stain it comes across i hope op has a bottle of neatsfoot handy
DIY,not_removed,a machine cant make things withlove though they are godless
DIY,not_removed,i assumed at the time that in his case it was clients wanting him to do subpar work so their friends would know theyd had something truly handmade custom for them and he didnt enjoy compromising even if he reluctantly did itthink ron swanson
DIY,not_removed,obenaufs is oils its oils suspended in beeswax and propolis
DIY,not_removed,cool i didnt know about that sub im adding it now thanks so much
DIY,not_removed,how long did this take you to finish great work by the way
DIY,not_removed,explain grody ive been working with leather for years now and have constructed a few veg tan bags myself one is unfinished and isnt grody it patinad picked up oils and has significant darkening from waterthe elements but it isnt grody
DIY,not_removed,theres a cheep factory outlet in bethlehem pa you can get cheeps for cheap
DIY,not_removed,thank you have spent days reading into this and creating a new pinterest this helps a lot
DIY,not_removed,tandy isnt the cheapest i go there occasionally i managed to find an entire cows worth of leather for less than that on sale at tandy
DIY,not_removed,this is what im finding my brother machine says it can do heavier materials but that is bunk my singer can totally handle medium weight denim but anything beyond that is a battle
DIY,not_removed,that makes it even more amazing
DIY,not_removed,hey thanks i already have an account with tandy when i bought some leather to repair gloves and boots awesome and thanks again
DIY,not_removed,dont worry man appreciate that that was a great work keep it up
DIY,not_removed,your work looks good friend also i have the same goode company pie boxwell actually have a good or lying around
DIY,not_removed,the way you designed your handle sets the bag apart nice work
DIY,not_removed,next time you should for sure this is a neat thing content creators can monetize their craft
DIY,not_removed,excellent im always looking for a new craft to dive into and leather working may just be it thank you
DIY,not_removed,great tyvm
DIY,not_removed,awesome thanks
DIY,not_removed,how long does it typically take i figured it would need a coat or oil or wax to cause it to darken and gloss but ive never really seen fresh leather so i am guessing from watching how its made too much like most things industrial processes are usually in a rush and do anything that will reduce the time if it doesnt drastically diminish the quality
DIY,not_removed,what you are calling random rolls i am seeing as pieces of leather with perfectly cut edges tossed haphazardly on a table if its really worth fake internet points to be a liar rock on with your bad self
DIY,not_removed,i stupidly bought a khaki laptop bag a few years back although it was canvas so i guess thats a different story
DIY,not_removed,you seem to know this stuff could you explain what full grain leather is
DIY,not_removed,for the uninitiated what does burnish the edges mean
DIY,not_removed,i like the look of burnished edges but i have been seeing unfinished edges in some midhigh end stores lately
DIY,not_removed,is leatherworking an expensive hobby to persue it looks really satisfying
DIY,not_removed,i opened the album and read finished product and thought but there was no finish work put into this product
DIY,not_removed,agreed im just getting started with leatherworking but in my opinion neglecting to burnish the edges is like skipping the sanding step in any woodworking project nah its a stylistic choice not a functional one
DIY,not_removed,some manufacturers will let you send it back to be relined you can also check around for a shoe repair place theyll often work on all kinds of leather goods
DIY,not_removed,maybe a shoe repair places if there are none for specifically handbags in your area
DIY,not_removed,almost all purses have liners like he is describing and they are in no way inconvenient they are still anchored around the top of the bag so they never come out all the way just invert out of the bag to make it easy to clean
DIY,not_removed,well it does work perfectly well as is i just thought id give some insight from owning big leather purses and working leather myself i think a blended fabric that doesnt build up static would help with the liner coming along with it
DIY,not_removed,you could fix that with couple of snaps in the bottom
DIY,not_removed,you could velcro it down in spots or a strip certainly my leather bag looks like garbage inside its like me old you could go the extra miles and connect a washable fitted liner by studs position the studs only where theres a double layer hiding it on the outside like where the carry strap attachments are
DIY,not_removed,doctors bags pilots cases etc use this method but yeah they have to add a piece a fullish top to the bag that the handle connects too so the flap has a large waterproof area its sitting on top of and you need somehow get that piece out of the way to get into the bag sometimes theyre only attached one side
DIY,not_removed,no there bag is zippered on its top under that flap here i found it httpsbuffalojacksoncomeverettmensvintageleathermessengerbaghtml
DIY,not_removed,no need to thank me everyone deserves a happy christmas if youre ever feeling down and need to talk feel free to message me
DIY,not_removed,for sure dont paper carriers usually have a shoulder strap that attaches to either end of the actual bag mine does paper is a beatch edit i see this bag op made has said end point anchors
DIY,not_removed,yep or two handles one each side and a clasp to connect them when the case is closed
DIY,not_removed,whats up tell dave cameron loves him
DIY,not_removed,got it thanks a bunch any tips on how to get started working with leather or just buy some cheap stuff and start making stuff would it be unrealistic to try something like the op without any experience and just learn as i go
DIY,not_removed,i will be messaging you on utc to local time to remind you of year to send a pm to also be reminded and to reduce spam parent commenter can httpnpredditcommessagecomposetoremindmebotsubjectdelete commentmessagedelete dbrykiv dont forget to add the time options after the of
DIY,not_removed,ohhh that wasnt what i meant i just presume that this is the last photos we will probably see of this
DIY,not_removed,maybe the person who designed the machine did it with love the person that purchased the design could be a different story
DIY,not_removed,
DIY,not_removed,cold bastards i tell ya
DIY,not_removed,youre right but still he doesnt need to oil dye it unless that was a typo on your end
DIY,not_removed,hours i could probably do it in half the time now most of the time i had to strategize on what to do next making it up as i go along and also spent time salvaging mistakes as well
DIY,not_removed,but what about httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvqellbcicdns
DIY,not_removed,thanks that means a lot to an amateur like me
DIY,not_removed,i have a lot of their products as well but they were all purchased when the prices were more in line with what i felt was reasonable to pay it just seems odd that they needed to raise prices by that much in order to have it make financial sense edit is a link to their before and after prices that coupled with the misinformation on their site and i have just moved away from them
DIY,not_removed,heres an example of a wallet i made brand new compared to a year later httpimgurcomaillko
DIY,not_removed,i definitely started cutting some stuff before i remembered to take a before pic but lol ok good luck finding the kit online
DIY,not_removed,there are multiple layers to a skin the outermost layer called the grain being the tightest strongest and most durable the bottom layer is the flesh full grain leather is leather whose grain layer hasnt been altered to remove imperfections this means full grain leather is the highest quality because it is the most aesthetically pleasing it possess the of the skin and durable full grain leather also develops a patina as it ages in comparison top grain leather possesses some or all of the grain layer but it has been buffed altered or finished to remove imperfections genuine leather often doesnt possess any of the grain layer at all when leather is split portions of the flesh side are removed to thin the leather this doesnt mean a leather isnt full grain since the top portion grain is still intact edit fix my stupid words
DIY,not_removed,leather is sold in multiple grades full grain leather is the full skin of the animal it is the strongest and most durable grade its generally used to make high end leather goods belts briefcases wallets split leathers are well split they are not made will th the full thickness of the leather top grain leather is the exterior of the flesh and suede is usually made with the lower split nubuck is the top split which has been sanded to make it look and feel like suede none of these is as strong as full grain but the outer facades are just as resiliantsplit leathers are used for pretty much any application that leather might be used for but theyre preferable in projects where thickness is important genuine leather is a special term used to refer to leather that has been corrected this usually means the grain is stamped in and the leather is dyed or painted to make it look more real if youre looking for good leather this is the wrong place to look this is what youre looking at in cheap watch straps and the belts they sell at walmart bonded leather is basically the leather equivalent of plywood its made by shredding scrap leather and gluing it together its cheap as hell but weak and likely to just kinda fall apart if you see a sofa that claims to be made of actual leather your probably looking at bonded hope this helps
DIY,not_removed,should shed some more light on the differences between various types of leather you might also appreciate
DIY,not_removed,its a finishing technique that smooths and polishes the edges see
DIY,not_removed,im a noob and just burnished my first leather successfully this week theres tons of ways to do it but i suggest getting the cheap wood hand burnisher on amazon and a tub of fiebings saddle soap run some chunks of the stuff down the edge and then quickly rub the burnisher grooves along the edge this will give you a very nice maybe amateur looking burnished edge it instantly ups the appearance of the project from cool to impressive
DIY,not_removed,ahhh burnishing and inner liners are powerful agents for the uninitiated but we are initiated arent we
DIY,not_removed,probably trendy to make it feel a little more hand made and rustic
DIY,not_removed,ive heard its relatively inexpensive to start with compared to other crafts i think i priced up a basic set of cutting stamping tools for £ that give you quite a few craft options could probable get fewer tools and the materials to make a belt for that price rang i might be a little off but i doubt by much
DIY,not_removed,the leather can be expensive
DIY,not_removed,its cheap for less than you could own all of the tools to do everything including carving designs if you buy only the tools you need you can get started on your first project for as little as
DIY,not_removed,this is fine advice check tailor shops as well
DIY,not_removed,seems like a little velcro on the bottom of the liner would solve this problem nicely
DIY,not_removed,eh i think itd be a matter of preference ive had bags like that and sometimes the lining being loose partially inverts and gets tangled up with the stuff in the bag i think a decent alternative would be a fully attached liner not just bare leather itd be more difficult to clean yes but it would also never present the problem of getting annoying so preference
DIY,not_removed,fold the cloth liner over a cardboard piece thats the same size as the bottom of the bag and jam the cardboard and cloth to the bottom helps keep the bags shape too
DIY,not_removed,or magnets would be cool for this
DIY,not_removed,yeah thats more or less what i thought its a tradeoff between durability style which is obviously subjective and ease of use
DIY,not_removed,will do
DIY,not_removed,vicarious love making machines
DIY,not_removed,he doesnt need to do any of this but a professional would have oil dyed it
DIY,not_removed,its taken me to sew the edging on a layer belt you are damn industrious
DIY,not_removed,my nanas sinnger does thinner leather ok wouldnt want to do veg tan but cxl is fine its one of the old factory ones with the motor under the table and a leather belt for the drive something like old
DIY,not_removed,what bothers me more is the amount of effort put into that spreadsheet lol
DIY,not_removed,love the look of the wallet would you be willing to make one for me for a price of course
DIY,not_removed,a link to the kit online is in this very thread
DIY,not_removed,wow thanks so much for the full description do you have any recommendations for vendorsbrandswebsites that sell full grain leather products i have a leather wallet that ive owned for over a decade that i absolutely love but is about due for a replacement i havent been able to find anything like it
DIY,not_removed,this is not accurate full grain is not the full skin it just contains the full grain layer there are multiple layers to the skin the outermost grain layer being the tightest strongest and most durable leather can be split and still be full grain as long as it still contains the full uncorrected grain layer top grain possesses some or all of the grain layer but it has been sanded or altered in some way
DIY,not_removed,wow all my life i thought genuine leather meant it wasnt fake good to know all of this and also makes sense why every leather couch falls apart after like years
DIY,not_removed,edges look burnedish
DIY,not_removed,i was hoping for a pic thanks
DIY,not_removed,how do you do that sander
DIY,not_removed,so thats what was lacking from the op pic thought it looked kinda raw and unfinished
DIY,not_removed,thank you
DIY,not_removed,which is ironic as the lack of burnishing would lead one to believe it was either machine produced or made by an amateur
DIY,not_removed,its not about trends its about cutting corners burnishing takes time and skill to correctly do and companies dont want to spend the extra time doing it so maybe theyll say its about aesthetics but its really about cutting down on construction time
DIY,not_removed,that makes sense so whatever youre pulling out of your bag doesnt bring the whole liner up if it snags a little nice idea
DIY,not_removed,you just put a button in the liner at the bottom so it snaps down
DIY,not_removed,eh i think itd be a matter of preference ive had bags like that and sometimes the lining being loose partially inverts and gets tangled up with the stuff in the bag it also rips way before the outside would wear out and then you have to cut it the rest of the way out anyway or deal with stuff falling behind the liner
DIY,not_removed,only if they can watch them be used
DIY,not_removed,i dont think you know what youre talking about his intention was to make a plain veg tan brief case if he dyed it it would no longer be plain veg tan oil dying does nothing except change the colour oil dying does not protect or condition leather it dyes it a professional would not have dyed a plain veg brief case if they wanted a plain veg brief case because it would no longer be plain it would be dyed
DIY,not_removed,oh man a whole belt i dont think id ever try that haha
DIY,not_removed,it was made by the followers on their facebook page the ones unhappy with the changes
DIY,not_removed,thats not possible
DIY,not_removed,well im biased since i have httpswwwinstagramcomdecadeleather of leather goods but there are a lot of great makers out there check out the toolbar on rleatherclassifieds for tons of other great redditors who make full grain leather goods
DIY,not_removed,this is true i was less accurate than i could have been for sake of brevity thanks for correcting me
DIY,not_removed,is there a term for leather which is definitely not split
DIY,not_removed,even if its top quality how many people actually apply leather conditioner to maintain their sofas
DIY,not_removed,do it with a leather edger scraping the top of the unfinished edge down then apply water or gum tragacanth to the edge fibers with a sponge finish by rubbing with a burnishing tool
DIY,not_removed,exactly burnish sanders
DIY,not_removed,you can do it with whatever i have a piece of wood i use to burnish edges its actually the handle of a stitch popping tool i also have a piece of deer antler that works
DIY,not_removed,i dont think high end leather goods care much about an extra step except for aesthetics
DIY,not_removed,i was going to say snaps perfect example would be the inside of a motorcycle helmet they use snaps to keep the padding in place
DIY,not_removed,no professional would make a vegetable tanned leather item without some sort of preservative or finish on it source am leatherworker for years made a living from it for a few of those
DIY,not_removed,damn they lit fam
DIY,not_removed,because you bought it somewhere else look you won youre getting a bunch of credit from strangers for putting pieces together thats an accomplishment be proud
DIY,not_removed,not that i know of the actual skins are very thick and that has most likely been split at some point you couldnt make a bag out of that stuff
DIY,not_removed,feel the burnish sander
DIY,not_removed,saddleback for example started an initiative a few years ago that said all of their products will now have scars scratches and undesirable marks because they feel it adds character that whole thing was so they could cut down on costs and use lower quality leather with more blemishes and passed it off as an aesthetic choice same with companies not burnishing its about cutting down on an extra step and extra cost
DIY,not_removed,no they wouldnt but they also wouldnt use oil dye ya know dye a colouring pigment to preserve or finish an item which is why i dont believe you know what youre talking about
DIY,not_removed,thats very interesting thanks i really had no idea it was so thick i dug a little deeper into leather terms and it seems that youre right there doesnt seem to be an agreedupon way to describe leather which is of its complete original asgrown unmolested thickness which is strange since theres tons of very specific terms to describe every layer and surface treatment of leather that has already been sliced
DIY,not_removed,personally id dye it with a fiebings oil dye then id buff it with neatsfoot oil then id finish it with either master spray shene a lanolinbased spray or montana pitch blend a beeswaxbased water repellent or preservative i would use an oil dye because tandys waterbased dyes are shitty and an alcohol dye like fiebings spirit dyes tend to dry the leather out too much because as the alcohol in the dye evaporates in the leather leaving the pigment behind it also takes a lot of the leathers natural moisture with it or hell you could go the really classic route and vinegaroon the whole thing a deep inky black then neatsfoot and rub it down but hey i clearly dont know what the fuck im talking about
DIY,not_removed,why do any of that to natural veg tan if you want to leave it natural you said it should have been oil dyed before hand why are you saying no veg tan should be left natural all op needs to do is add obenaufs or something similar and thats it no dying vinagroon or any other colouring youre adding an extra unnecessary step because of personal preference but its clear op wanted to retain the natural properties and colour of veg tan in his piece he doesnt need to oil dye it thats your personal preference end of discussion

DIY,not_removed,you are going to get invited to a lot more weddings after this
DIY,not_removed,nice work just curious why blo over tung
DIY,not_removed,amazing craftsmanship reminds me of a madrone bench that was given to my aunt and uncle in law at their wedding but your table definitely beats the carved bench
DIY,not_removed,fantastic job
DIY,not_removed,wow what was the reaction of your newly wedded friends had they seen it developing or was it a complete surprise
DIY,not_removed,i was not expecting thst at all great work
DIY,not_removed,it would have turned out better if you took your time
DIY,not_removed,that is one of the coolest things ive seen on reddit amazing work
DIY,not_removed,thanks
DIY,not_removed,yeah we actually dont own a coffee tableso that is next that said once you start trying to make money off of something it becomes a job and the fun is diminished
DIY,not_removed,appreciate it
DIY,not_removed,
DIY,not_removed,surprise although they knew something was coming because we gave them an iou for their wedding gift and at some point had to stop having them over because the table took over our apartment
DIY,not_removed,mostly they were just kinda speechless punctuated with what
DIY,not_removed,aww thanks too kind
DIY,not_removed,thanks
DIY,not_removed,the joke around the house is that our next coffee table will be just cinder blocks and a piece of plywood
DIY,not_removed,haha i think it may be back to picking something random off the registry for us
DIY,not_removed,thanks i cant recall if we tried a test in tung but of the different finishes we did try we liked the blo the best because it was most vibrant also weve used blo in so many projects in the past with great results so it was safe
DIY,not_removed,it was a complete surprise—was a lot of fun to give it to them and see their expressions
DIY,not_removed,thanks
DIY,not_removed,haha we were all freaked out that we were so late past their wedding date but then we learned there is a year grace periodwhew
DIY,not_removed,thanks
DIY,not_removed,thats why you charge enough to outsource the manufacturing p you could use your designs and stain colorsetc and then pay someone to actually do the tedious parts
DIY,not_removed,that said once you start trying to make money off of something it becomes a job and the fun is diminished not always i work at an after market automotive ac company as their director of video production it is literally my dream job take video edit animation render and done i cant believe i get paid to basically fuck around all day some after effects here premiere pro ther and grab a gopro or video camera there this is literally a dream job come true i even get to work on cars and trucks as side projects the company pays for along with some beer on the clock every once in awhile shit i would do this job for free if i did not have bills to pay
DIY,not_removed,hahaha i was wondering about this such a lovely table and gift excellent work
DIY,not_removed,but i want to build the next thing rather than figuring out how to rebuild the last thing cheaperplus marketingresource managementetc
DIY,not_removed,ha yeah i think that didnt fully come out right i design apps all day and love it but once youre running a business then you dont get to just focus on the part that you enjoy if you also were in charge of selling the ac units marketing etc then you unfortunately wouldnt get to fuck around all day d
DIY,not_removed,one of a kind items are even pricier so you could always just make stuff you like and then have a website to put it up for sale on when its completed that way no rushyou can just make something whenever you feel inspired to
DIY,not_removed,yeah that would definitely be the best way to go for us ive got enough deadlines at work
DIY,not_removed,umm i believe etsy would be perfect however they wouldnt be personal like a small town with a guy proposing in them but nyc or a big city might work
DIY,not_removed,you might have gotten by with only one gfci with the other two downstream seems odd but my house has one gfci covering three bathrooms
DIY,not_removed,only thing you can really do is get your wires pushed in and back far enough so they dont get in the way of the outlet sitting flush
DIY,not_removed,assuming you have standard modern walls you did something wrong yank it out and start over do it right dont mickey mouse it youll never sleep well if you do
DIY,not_removed,this did the trick i was searching all afternoon and could not find a thing to tell me how to do this on google everything came out with it being crooked along the top and bottom for leveling and making sure it was not sticking out past the plate when i googled fold electrical outlet accordion style the how tos popped up this was the trick that fix the problem thank you
DIY,not_removed,my house has no gfci in the bathroom which reminds me i should replace that outlet
DIY,not_removed,main box is screwin fuses our entire kitchen and bathroom doesnt have anything other than standard two plug outlets im gonna make it a project next month to replace them all with safer ones
DIY,not_removed,dont forget to cut the breaker i may or may not have shocked myself by not shutting the right breaker off
DIY,not_removed,gfcis dont need grounds in fact the nec permits you to replace ungrounded receptacles with gfcis and label them as no equipment ground gfcis work by detecting an imbalance between the neutral and hot and tripping when that exceeds a certain threshold which is if i remember correctly
DIY,not_removed,no we have three prong plugs there is definitely grounding i think the house was rewired in the gfci plugs will help i think
DIY,not_removed,hah yeah for sure
DIY,not_removed,exactly the gfci will work just fine however the test function on an ungrounded gfci will not work the test button closes a switch that puts the hot lead across a resistor and then to ground if the gfci is working it should be able to detect the hotneutral imbalance and cut power without a ground theres nowhere for current to go so no imbalance and the gfci wont activate
DIY,not_removed,i lived in a house that had prong plugs but was not wired for ground at all this is the same house that i may or may not have shocked myself in
DIY,not_removed,that looks cool good job
DIY,not_removed,im always surprised by what people on this subreddit restore great work op
DIY,not_removed,do an electrolysis rust removal on it super easy you just need a car battery charger a bucket some small bit of metal do a google search on it it will remove all the rust and not damage the metal at all anything else sanding sand blasting etc will ruin the original finish and metal
DIY,not_removed,i dont know how to add a thumbnail for the post how is that done
DIY,not_removed,i like it if i shaved i would probably like it more
DIY,not_removed,very nice work i absolutely love restoring vintage safety razors
DIY,not_removed,i have the same razor it had almost identical issues i used silver solder to fix the crack although it was a bit smaller than yours i really like the wood handle had i done that i might still use it
DIY,not_removed,awesome work though i would have loved to see a shiny version of the original also i think you have an obsession with making razors heavy
DIY,not_removed,i restore all sorts of cool stuff this is just the first time i remembered to take pictures my mom has a gumball machine from the that i want to restore but she kind of wants to leave it looking crappy since it is all original i understand keeping it pure but it would be gorgeous if it looked new again
DIY,not_removed,to remove what the oxidation is fixed with mild acid which wont hurt the metal unless you are talking about removing the nickel plating
DIY,not_removed,thank you do you have any pics of stuff youve done im always looking for more ideas
DIY,not_removed,it was so corroded i didnt see the crack until it was clean it was completely full of oxidation
DIY,not_removed,i agree but with the crack in the handle it would have eventually fallen apart it was super easy to slip the threaded insert out no use having a patina on something useless
DIY,not_removed,yeah if you sand it or sandblast it you run the risk of removing the nickel plating electrolysis will remove only the patina rust green stuff and leave the original nickel plating
DIY,not_removed,gem micromatic my stepdad found metal detecting definitely not in mint shape but it is smooth and shiny now
DIY,not_removed,vintage gillette pocket razor when they still had serial numbers i think this one turned out amazing it was totally tarnished and dirty when i found it sorry i never took before pictures back when i got these because i didnt know people would be interested
DIY,not_removed,so will plain vinegar evidenced by my results and that is a whole lot easier i thought about trying reverse electroplating to remove the nickel but i couldnt be arsed
DIY,not_removed,those are both super cool great condition on both of them
DIY,not_removed,oh my bad on my phone it only showed the first picture i was under the impression you were asking how to restore the razor now that i have seen it on the computer i realize it was a how to sorry
DIY,not_removed,thanks
DIY,not_removed,lol no problem d
DIY,not_removed,this definitely beats the snot out of my weather rock out front
DIY,not_removed,omg i want this my grandfather would love it as well
DIY,not_removed,thats an analog output though
DIY,not_removed,get that patent pending amirite
DIY,not_removed,nice work how exactly do you predict coming weather i have a project coming up where i need to predict rain and i was wondering how to achieve that would you mind sharing your code
DIY,not_removed,well done i would purchase one if you were interested let me know
DIY,not_removed,thats really awesome great job im a big fan of those hot glue guns too
DIY,not_removed,thats too awesome everybody will think its analog though heres an idea for next one same as this but with more buttons make them look analog too how about it
DIY,not_removed,thats so awesome i love it when new technologies get a retrovintage look great job man cant wait too see more
DIY,not_removed,this is absolutely beautiful
DIY,not_removed,wouldnt a orange pi zero times and times cheaper for this project
DIY,not_removed,great project fantastic cat name my kitty in high school was named slash he lived a very long happy life i wish your slash the same
DIY,not_removed,awesome i got confused as to why your temperature dial only goes up to but then i figured youre probably from a slightly colder place than i am
DIY,not_removed,but after the nuclear apocalypse well all be lining up to get your rocks forecast
DIY,not_removed,glad you like it
DIY,not_removed,it does a really good job at replicating
DIY,not_removed,he said in the album that he just uses his arduino to pull the info from the internet
DIY,not_removed,as ulilboneair pointed out it connects to your local wifi network and then to weatherunderground it takes the pertinent data from there and points to the weather based on the conditions
DIY,not_removed,i put but its my first time with github so i might have missed a few things take a look and please feel free to ask me questions
DIY,not_removed,i think i need to screw the motors into the board because ive had the heat from the motor be enough to cause the glue to fail great for a quick fix though
DIY,not_removed,i had originally planned to use motors but i ran out of pins on my arduino there are ways to use a stepper motor shield that holds more but i went the easy route
DIY,not_removed,thanks i was really happy with how it turned out
DIY,not_removed,thank you
DIY,not_removed,yes it probably would be but i havent converted my code into pi and i dont think it can handle the hardware the backbone of the sketch is from an old project that used neopixel leds which were more stable on an arduino i dont think the pi has enough pins to run the three stepper motors and the three hall sensors theres probably a way to do it but i used what i had i would also like to see if this can be converted to use on an
DIY,not_removed,thank you he has a sister named duff and we had an old cat named axl kind of a theme
DIY,not_removed,more likely celsius join the rest of the world us
DIY,not_removed,yep it was made for wyoming where it gets very cold but never too far above you could adjust the temp scale to just about anywhere though
DIY,not_removed,no dude the answer is i can build one for xxx
DIY,not_removed,one mans easy route is another mans theoretical physics keep up the good work of making stuff
DIY,not_removed,if i am not mistaken arduino ide has a weather library for for default and wemos has a arduino mega hybrid might worth a try if you wanted your yun back
DIY,not_removed,it could be converted easily both to module or standalone called nodemcu nodemcu is just like but can be programmed from arduino but both are cheaper than yun esp is around on ebay if i recall correctly also i was wondering why were you using steppers since servos even though they are less accurate would use less pins on arduino only for pwm control per servo and would remove the need for hall sensor great job on wood design i really like it
DIY,not_removed,a celcius dial wouldnt need to go to thats incredibly hot
DIY,not_removed,where do you live thats
DIY,not_removed,nowhere in the world does it ever get above c it would be insane to include anything higher than that on a gauge like this also only having a resolution of degrees like this is pretty useless for celsius it would be very hard to tell at a glance whether something was in say the high or the low which is a minor difference in fahrenheit but a pretty major one in celsius
DIY,not_removed,i tried that with one of my last projects and i found out that im more of a tinkerer than a businessman if anyone wants to team up im all ears but i just like making them
DIY,not_removed,i guess the easiest solution would be to add another arduino if everything was powered at the same time they would likely sync at that point then maybe sync using a clock and you could add another whole setup thanks
DIY,not_removed,i would certainly like to try the and i also have an httpsonionio that i havent found a project for when i first started this project i had servos in mind but they didnt rotate a full and the ones that did were expensive so i tried the steppers and then just moved forward with those i like the stepper motor speed rotation freedom and theyre pretty quiet compared to a servo there were some hurdles to overcome but thats half the fun of a project like this
DIY,not_removed,when do you drive your car i probably would have chosen a different temperature scale removing and in favor of more resolution on more realistic temperatures
DIY,not_removed,dude this is awesome theres definitely a business potential here how big is it how much did it cost in material how many hours did it take you to make it
DIY,not_removed,i was being sarcastic i am fairly certain its fahrenheit °f to °f is the equivalent to °c to °c
DIY,not_removed,thanks the board is about x so the frame makes it a bit bigger i thought it was going to be an easy jump from httpimgurcomaiujza but there were lots of little hurdles luckily most of the stripping of info from the internet was done that was a headache the last time total materials was less than with the arduino yun costing the bulk of that if i were going to make one from scratch with all of the programming knowledge just to replicate it might take a couple of days the drying of the modge podge takes an overnight dry
DIY,not_removed,thats always very difficult i bake cakes and pricing is tough especially because people dont realize the work that goes into it similar with this tbh for materials seems steep but im not questioning you i have no idea what went into this if you do decide to sell dont allow anyone make you feel bad for your price unless its like lol change for your time and talent plus materials good luck if you decide to do it
DIY,not_removed,same here custom beanbag boards here and and people expect to pay less then
DIY,not_removed,the last project also taught me that taking something like this from inside your own home and trying to convert it to a commercial product takes a lot more skill and troubleshooting before releasing it into the wild theyre great tinkering projects but i dont mind putting the time and money into it because i enjoy the journey
DIY,not_removed,nothing sucks as much as rust on a car mine just crossed the old mark and now some spots are showing trough for my next car i really want aluminium
DIY,not_removed,there is no point to try and repair these fenders on my audi new ones are euros a fender but if it would have been oldclassic car yes i would have fixed the fenders just to keep it as original as possible
DIY,not_removed,i thought he was going to repair the rust and thought why would he bother on a recent audi he can buy new ones and paint them for cheap
DIY,not_removed,i recommend living in the western us rust is very rare
DIY,not_removed,they just dont make them as rust proof as they used to i had a pleasure doing body work and paint on a vw golf cabrio few months agao and the only rusted out parts where rear wheel wells wich needed replacement but dou to fact that the owner wanted to add bigger wheels on his car and used hammer to beat the fenders lip and left all the dirt between the fender and inner fender but almost all other rust was just surface rust
DIY,not_removed,that would be a pretty big move considering i as op live in europe although i want to roadtrip there at some point
DIY,not_removed,not all can live in a place where rust is rare i just fix it change what needs to be changed for my car and customers cars i do this as my day job aswell and of my income is based on rust repairs and i would miss the winters that we have here a lot of snow
DIY,not_removed,what cars are like more rustproof now than they were or years ago
DIY,not_removed,yeah but just think of all the freedom youve have instead of rust
DIY,not_removed,my personal experience they are not i have worked on so many modern cars ca years old that have rust bubbles all over them and im talking about japanese cars and even european cars
DIY,not_removed,cant argue with that can i
DIY,not_removed,alright my guess is kemah tx with the powerlines next to the elevated highway
DIY,not_removed,lovely job i have fond memories of sailing around harbors in a dyer when i was a little kid please post this over in rsailing as well
DIY,not_removed,awesome got excited when i saw it was kemah im a few minutes down the road
DIY,not_removed,i totally read the headline as destroyed and got a little too excited but still great job
DIY,not_removed,yes sir
DIY,not_removed,hi ho when i got my boat i was portofino i dock wonder if i still know anyone there great restoration and a beautiful little dingy how does she sail
DIY,not_removed,she doesnt point so well but much faster on a beam reach that i thought she would be
DIY,not_removed,shit that looks super professional

DIY,not_removed,i like your idea of using plywood youll never have to worry about a strong connection back in the day we would use some extra pieces on all our electrical sub panels
DIY,not_removed,i put mine between two studs and screwed into them there was plenty of room for some insulation behind it and the external plywood are you saying that you are not putting it inside the wall and intend on mounting it to the wall pics would be best
DIY,not_removed,i think hes proposing to put the luan inside the enclosure on the back panel im no expert but you may lose some bonding to ground which may or may not matter with low energy stuff and it would also make it less flexible to accommodate future changes if im not mistaken a big point of these modular enclosures is to allow flexibility for future upgrades as technology changes the push pins make the process of addingreplacing components and rerouting cables much easier sorry if im misunderstanding if so please ignore
DIY,not_removed,you could also get the mounting bracket for the enclosure if youre looking for a cleaner look
DIY,not_removed,mounting a plywood panel inside of a wiring closet is a standard technique for commercial and industrial wiring and will serve you well i recommend the not thickness
DIY,not_removed,i use small self tapping screws for things with mounting holes sharpie and a pilot hole helps keep it clean because tappers like to start walking on you in the beginning for things without mounting holes i like to fish long zip ties through the existing mounting holes or make my own holes when needed some thingsie network switches come with rack ears which can sometimes be rotated sideways and screwed with tappers into the panel when doing pilot holes make sure to not accidentally drill through the drywall into the next room it is very easy to do but of course i wouldnt know from experience
DIY,not_removed,i am placing it between studs it is in a wall a previous owner built to make the laundry room separate from the garage i am just not sure how much deadspace i will have behind it
DIY,not_removed,actually i am thinking about placing it on the backside not within the cabinet i would just secure it with a small screw in each corner i know the plastic pushpins are designed to make it easy but some things could mount on a couple screws and thought the plywood might make future attachments easier it may not though
DIY,not_removed,i had about a half inch so room for a little insulation
DIY,not_removed,i saw some good ones made from what appeared to be modified lampshades perhaps lampshade dipped on epoxy of some sort they looked nice and clean and the leds were visible what i can really say is dont make it out of a bucket please while i applaud peoples effort and going through the process of making a costume to begin with the bucket ones just look a bit messy and cheap

DIY,not_removed,nicely done im jealous of all your equipment including the festools
DIY,not_removed,im sure that glue will hold for ages but man thatd make me nervous id probably put some washerbacked screws in there for extra support but thats probably over engineering it
DIY,not_removed,whats the thinking behind mounting the lenses and whoah nice to the top arent you worried about zoom creep on the heavier ones
DIY,not_removed,very nice
DIY,not_removed,i hope you arent in an area with seismic activity
DIY,not_removed,amazing good job it definitely makes me nervous seeing all those lenses just hanging there i would definitely put some screws in instead of just glue
DIY,not_removed,
DIY,not_removed,looks epic as a fellow photographer i dont know if i could bring myself to trust that glue not that it isnt safe at all im sure it can hold the weight of those lenses i would use the biggest bolts i could find but thats because im super paranoid seriously great job absolutely beautiful design and execution those petzvals look right at home up there
DIY,not_removed,right on man this looks awesome
DIY,not_removed,anyone wanna take a stab at the approximate cost all together in usd
DIY,not_removed,as a fellow nikon shooter im insanely jealous
DIY,not_removed,im no photographer by any means but this looks fab id better hide this post from my so i know for sure she would want one good work op
DIY,not_removed,thought for a sec the picture was upside down floating lenses cool idea and well done
DIY,not_removed,this is great if you shoot fromin a studio or have a bunch of back caps around and dont mind having to put a cap on whenever you take a lens off the shelf would still make me nervous as hell though
DIY,not_removed,wow that shelf is holding up
DIY,not_removed,its funny to see a festool being the least expensive item in these pictures
DIY,not_removed,how are you holding those lenses i dont get it im the dumb one who dropped my lens once and scared just looking at that picture
DIY,not_removed,theyre all very handy d
DIY,not_removed,but thats probably over engineering it for equipment worth many thousands of dollars a few screws would still be underengineered p
DIY,not_removed,unfortunately the screw head would then hang directly in front of the glass there is some space there but its not something i would want to fuck with if it were my lenses honestly hanging the lenses off the plastic caps in the first place makes me a bit uncomfortable regardless of how the caps are mounted
DIY,not_removed,lens creep is a myth for modern lenses
DIY,not_removed,im not
DIY,not_removed,thanks man
DIY,not_removed,sure id give it a go as an upfront ill say ill see which ones i can identify bar text text text text text text petzval something petzval something petzval something text text text text text body is no longer made text text text text text all these zeiss lenses cost a shitton and cannot be identyfied from this photo gimbal text text text text looks like ive way underestimated this this is already €

DIY,not_removed,it says in the gallery polyurethane glue which is super strong
DIY,not_removed,with that much glass i think id also like something to keep them from falling off the sides and front
DIY,not_removed,yeah why not just like place the lenses on the shelf
DIY,not_removed,not on my canon unfortunately

DIY,not_removed,that looks really well done excellent work if youre interested in design critique ive got a few personal observations it shouldnt need to be said but this is just what jumps to my mind looking at it and not an attempt to say that your design is somehow wrong or needing change design sensibilities and tastes differ but i always find that hearing others observations help me see aspects of my designs that i was blind to before the striped top is beautiful and striking the strength of that design element as well as the size and visual prominence of the top makes it the central visual element and sets up the whole piece for a high contrast linear motif that gets reinforced by the squareness of the structural pieces and by the contrasting wood of the crossbeam the round pegs break with that motif theyre the only rounded elements and their positioning and high contrast draws attention away from other elements in a way that weakens them to my mind pins that match the wood they are in or that continue the linear design theme might work better the feet also feel a little out of place they are the only long element with nonsquare faces but also feel like big plain blocks that dont talk with the rest of the design the beveled top are probably needed give the right visual weight and match our expectations of what feet should look like on this type of table but adding some linear embellishment might help them feel more connected with the top
DIY,not_removed,this is impressive because i cannot think of a way to turn walnuts and ashes into a table it even looks like real wood
DIY,not_removed,really like this table hope to be able to do something similar at some point in the future
DIY,not_removed,how much would this cost
DIY,not_removed,beautiful table i have a stack of old hardwood from when the house was renovated that i want to turn into a coffee table and this has inspired me to start drawing up some plans and get started
DIY,not_removed,thanks
DIY,not_removed,i spent about on materials mainly because in my area walnut is pretty damn expensive i used as much walnut to ash and paid about the same for both woods if i were selling it id have to sell it for at least

DIY,not_removed,go over it again with a different color like grey or brown then wipe
DIY,not_removed,brillo pads and vinegar might work
DIY,not_removed,if its white washed yeah pretty much sanding of some type
DIY,not_removed,wire brush maybe brass is another option could keep a stroke pattern
DIY,not_removed,sanding it with grit or depending on how you colored it use a watered down remover of the correct type
DIY,not_removed,sponge on deeper colors for a natural look you can also use a feather to draw in veins and fleck paint from an old tooth brush for speckles

DIY,not_removed,yeah you should always remove painters tape a few hours after you stick it down or it does become just regular tape once its dried out shield looks amazing where do you buy fiberglass resin nowadays
DIY,not_removed,wheres bucky
DIY,not_removed,does fiberglass resin end up feeling like plastic or what ive only ever used epoxy resin
DIY,not_removed,rcosplayprops might like this

DIY,not_removed,uhhhis this yours or the original posters
DIY,not_removed,oh snap
DIY,not_removed,thats a pretty big chunk missing i would first get some plumbers putty its a twopart epoxy compound fill in the gap with that sand it smooth flush with the sink surface carefully not to mar the sink surface then use the porcelain touchup liquid to match the color good luck

DIY,not_removed,itd be a bit of a nightmare to sand epoxy without damaging but it sounds like a good plan maybe use two part car body filler much easier to sand and durable enough for that part of a sink
DIY,not_removed,body filler might work im not sure how well it will bond with the sink though it you tape off the area surrounding the filled in area marring the surface shouldnt be an issue and plumbers putty isnt as hard as pure epoxy its kind of like body filler that way
DIY,not_removed,toothpaste and a damp wash cloth to buff it away maybe
DIY,not_removed,i have used nail polish remove acetone to remove scuff marks on a pair of jordans and it came straight off and kept the leather intact
DIY,not_removed,id try a little naptha lighter fluid
DIY,not_removed,are you sure its not damage to the surface like a scrape
DIY,not_removed,ill give that a try and update you
DIY,not_removed,unfortunately that did not work
DIY,not_removed,unfortunately that did not work
DIY,not_removed,ill give that a try and update you
DIY,not_removed,unfortunately that did not work
DIY,not_removed,yeah i closed with with my shoe
DIY,not_removed,i understand but im asking if the scuff is rubber from your shoe or damage to the finish if its damage to the finish theres no amount of buffing that will remove it
DIY,not_removed,im sure it was my shoe i lifted it with my foot and then pushed it closed also it doesnt feel damaged at all
DIY,not_removed,aw man i liked the kitchen
DIY,not_removed,that is a nice job you didnt install stuff that will date the kitchen prematurely which is the most often made mistakefolks try and cram everything on trend into a reno and it ends up looking awful nice restraint in your choices however you have fallen victim to the new fridges are no where near cabinet depth problem cabinet depth fridges are redic expensive for some reason and all the normal ones stick out solution is to either cut out the studs immediately behind put in a header and a couple of jack studs and then drywall that giving you additional inches or simply twist the studs so they line up flat giving you inches or so if you are careful the fridge going back in hides all the work so you dont even have to be super careful with finishing the drywalljust paint trust me moving that fridge back into the wall by inches will make a world of difference further to that moving the above fridge cabinets out to end flush with the fridge and putting a gable up between the cabinets and fridge side will complete the look tie it all together so to speak
DIY,not_removed,you know what you did a great job but the version makes me feel like a kid at home again
DIY,not_removed,dont put anything hot on those countertops they will burn that includes crockpots and griddles and i hope the fabricator installed support brackets under the countertops above the dishwasher depending on the quartz brand if the fabricator did not install those supports the warranty is void ifwhen the countertop begins to bow overtime due to the heat from the dishwasher i sell stone countertops including quartz for a living and these are some of the things we have discovered about quartz i really hope that whoever sold you the quartz discussed the pros and cons and practical use rather than just saying its low maintenance harder than granite stain proof heat proof and perfect
DIY,not_removed,great job looks like a whole new room
DIY,not_removed,looks great im in the process of doing the same sort of thing lower budget but very similar the only thing i can say is that you may want cgfi outlets near the sink
DIY,not_removed,great job you could easily dehgtv it by doing a funky vailance on a spring rod between the sink cabinets the hardware is nice but a little vanilla what about glass knobs in a bold color i notice the mixer is cobalt which is also in the kitchen towel i like hearing about peoples frustrations and mistakes in their diys its a lot more honest than those home improvement shows did you test for lead before sanding down those cabinets if they were from the paint could still be lead based
DIY,not_removed,dope but wheres the rgb
DIY,not_removed,wow it looks modern now great work
DIY,not_removed,to the best it looks more like just some observations you should have got rid of curves on the counter top and made it square edged i know its not super safe but black glossy counter top to match your stove top would been awesome and the cabinet handles could have had matching black handles or well done on the effort good job
DIY,not_removed,dont hate me but i like the version a lot more this feels like transforming jim morrison into justin bieber
DIY,not_removed,wait is that a singlebasin sink are people going back to those why
DIY,not_removed,nice work i did essentially the same thing months ago the only difference was our old countertops and back splash were matching tile ill never buy another house with tile countertops i wasnt a happy diyer taking that out
DIY,not_removed,looks great was that your first time doing tile work im about to do a similar backsplash and am a little nervous
DIY,not_removed,is the countertop color stormy sky polished
DIY,not_removed,thats looking awesome looking at it even im feeling to renovate my kitchen nice idea
DIY,not_removed,is it hard to wash dishes in a black sink seems like it would be really dark
DIY,not_removed,you did a great job love the subway tile how is the counter holding up never used quartz but we might buy an investment property and were looking at it as an option also our cat did the same thing as yours when we were moving and had all it cabinets open haha
DIY,not_removed,i have the exact same kitchen layout as you window and sliding door included
DIY,not_removed,the view out your kitchen window is cool
DIY,not_removed,what was wrong before
DIY,not_removed,i dont like the cabinets or the rounded countertop edge i wouldve kept the edge straight sharp like all other edges or lines in the kitchen or put a waterfall edge
DIY,not_removed,turns out youre not alone i didnt mine but didnt love the old look my wife on the other hand wasnt a fan were looking into how to add character changing out the blinds and maybe painting because right now as much as i love it its a little too hgtv for me
DIY,not_removed,thats actually something i hadnt considered one problem we may run into though is the wall the fridge backs up to has a hallway on the other side so if we cut back into it it seems like it could cause potential issues on the other side i agree on the above fridge cabinets they are currently useless but im not sure how to bring them out
DIY,not_removed,crock pots i have never had a crock pot mark even a laminate countertop
DIY,not_removed,i thought or was told that outlets can all sync to the same gfi and you only need one so when the one trips all four of those also trip when i test the gfi they all turn off but maybe it doesnt work in reverse was i told incorrectly
DIY,not_removed,do you have any examples of what to do between the sink cabinets thats where we plan to accent everything as for the knobs we went vanilla for now knowing we can easily change them in the future we didnt test but i used a good mask when sanding
DIY,not_removed,its coming were changing out the blinds for some other window covering and planning to paint were just not sure what colors we want to add
DIY,not_removed,appreciate the feedback you and i have very very different tastes though
DIY,not_removed,thats fair i personally didnt mind the old version but my wife hated it
DIY,not_removed,i like tem both and i dont feel like it was such a big change at least not in the photos
DIY,not_removed,it is are people going back i dont know but my wife and i preferred it its better for washing big pots and pans we dont hand wash much else so no need for a double sink
DIY,not_removed,i love my deep single basin there is plenty of room for large pots and pans and grandkids
DIY,not_removed,i love my large single basin sink if i want to soak something while leaving part of the sink free i can use a dish tub when i want to wash large pots and pans theres plenty of space
DIY,not_removed,first tile backsplash work but ive done some tile flooring before this was a little trickier as the tiles were small i admit i wasted a lot i bought extra and ended with only about square feet of tile left over
DIY,not_removed,backsplash is a piece of cake especially if you have done tile work before
DIY,not_removed,nope its kensho grey
DIY,not_removed,nope theres enough light in the kitchen to offset any darkness from the sink
DIY,not_removed,its only been a few weeks but the counters are still great ill know more in a few years
DIY,not_removed,thanks theres actually a little pond through the trees too plus our back neighbor has an incredible garden wasnt even a top reason we bought but its now one of the things i love most
DIY,not_removed,about total
DIY,not_removed,what about the cabinets dont you like we saved by using the existing ones a sharp edge would cut into that walkway and be a hip buster a waterfall wouldve been nearly impossible as our heat vent comes out right there
DIY,not_removed,werent kitchens all about the oak cabinets
DIY,not_removed,white cabinets solid surface gray counters stainless steel appliances brushed nickel hardware and subway tile it would be difficult to be less than that
DIY,not_removed,please put some grass in a cement container and go ultimate hgtv d
DIY,not_removed,our kitchen actually just went from the late to modern day recently and we decided to keep the faux wood cabinets and wood laminate countertops it still has a homey feel but it isnt gaudy like it used to be
DIY,not_removed,im so glad you said this i was trying to figure out a nice way to suggest getting rid of the vertical blinds it looks lovely i was surprised that you had painted the cabinets which is a great sign that you did a beautiful job well done
DIY,not_removed,im just impressed with how good it looked before it was clearly well maintained
DIY,not_removed,if you do it right the other side doesnt look different at all interior framing is an almost inch cavity with drywall on both sides cutting a rectangle out a bit wider and a bit taller than the fridge removing the studs that are in the way along with the plate on the floor and slipping in a header and a couple of jack studs to support the header is easy clean up the opening a little paint and push the fridge back only now a further inches at least you can even drywall this niche you now have with thin drywall if you want pretty pulling the over fridge cabinets out is as simple as building a frame attaching it to back and side walls if any and then install cabinet to thatthen cover all with a couple of gables floor to at least cabinet height sheets of panels finished as you would then install crown moulding all around the kitchentie it all together have you noticed tie it all together ends up costing you money if you had all the material on hand painted and ready to go a carpenter would have all that banged out in a couple of hours if its further into diy than you want to go but its easy
DIY,not_removed,i dont do imgur and am unsure if i can use photobucket here so just google fridge gable and click on some images its basically a big trim piece runs up both or one side of the fridge usually floor to top of cabinets
DIY,not_removed,true story essentially quartz is made with crushed up natural quartz and resins those resins have a relatively low burn point and will discolorburn at that temp the quartz brand that i sell even recommends not using crock pots or heated appliances directly on the surface of the countertop albeit in the fine print but it is still there people also need to be careful setting wine bottle down on the countertop there have been instances of the ridges on the bottom of wine bottles chipping the surface thats directly from the manufacturer long story quartz is not what it has been marketed as its not a bad product but the claims made by the quartz companies do not match reality and the actual usability most people looking at quartz are going for form over function imo personally i would not do quartz in my kitchen knowing how it holds up for the money a person is much better off with a more plain granite that will hold up much longer
DIY,not_removed,those suckers get hot i wouldnt put a hot crockpot insert on my solid surface counters
DIY,not_removed,that sounds about right i didnt see you had one mind you i am not an electrician just someone who was told i should have them in my kitchen
DIY,not_removed,well if it were me i would get a simple spring rod head to joanns fabrics or someplace like that and get a length of fabric in a fun print chili peppers or something kitcheny that matched the space and then i would sew a valiance curtain i cant do diy for nothing but i can sew if you have access to a machine there are heaps of online tutes for measuring and making up a simple rodpocket valiance super easy about four straight seams then maybe i would tack up some small vintage kitchen things on the sides of those cabinets like some small advertisements or printed recipe cards
DIY,not_removed,fair enough i just know my so went crazy when she had to deal with our old single
DIY,not_removed,theyre a common choice if you have a dishwasher since people are generally only washing pots and pans in the sink and tend not to need to fill up a sink for that eta i prefer a twobasin sink but i naughtily like to thaw things in it i never fill up the sink to do dishes since we got our blessed dishwasher
DIY,not_removed,indeed they are more room for activites i love your countertop my wife would like that same material just a diff color what was your spend on the coutertop if you dont mind looks great btw
DIY,not_removed,cool it looks nice but i was wondering about the practicality
DIY,not_removed,good to know thanks
DIY,not_removed,thanks on the cabinets my wife did of the painting on those the blinds we thought about just removing ahead of time but we just arent sure what well replace them with quite yet
DIY,not_removed,depending on the age of the house the space in the wall might be an inch or so less i found out the hard way that our house is this way after buying and half installing prebuilt doors only to find out they stuck out an inch extra when i slid the trim piece into place
DIY,not_removed,you mind sharing what quartz you sell ive used a lot of cambria dupont zodiac and silestone never had any complaints from clients
DIY,not_removed,first i had no idea that would really infuriate me second what dont i know about my laminate counters
DIY,not_removed,oh the insert i thought you meant the crock pot itself i see now
DIY,not_removed,the one to the left of the sink is a gfi though tough to tell in the pictures none of the rest are but as mentioned theyre connected i am far from an electrician so i am relying on info from others
DIY,not_removed,appreciate the ideas and thoughts hadnt thought of doing something along those lines the main idea so far has been some stylistic curtains possibly buying several of the same size to swap our depending on the season
DIY,not_removed,countertop was installed
DIY,not_removed,so far so good the only thing i dont love is the sink is almost too flat at the bottom so water doesnt drain quickly but thats not because its black
DIY,not_removed,it does seem that white on white on white was one of the styles didnt even realize that
DIY,not_removed,ugh those are awesome i dont remember a lot of white kitchens though everything was wood melamine cabinets in ivory with those wood handles along the bottom or white with the rounded plastic handles was early my favorite kitchen and house is from the movie hello again
DIY,not_removed,caesarstone is the main brand that i sell
DIY,not_removed,lol yeah we get more call backs and complaints about issues with quartz than we do with our natural stone countertops laminate countertops are pretty straight forward and dont really have any hidden secrets as far as usability that being said i see new construction utilizing more basicstandard granite colors more and more rather than laminates or formica as granite has become more affordable and competitively priced almost to the point that certain granite colors are almost the same cost as a laminate or formica there are some inexpensive quartz brands out there as well but like anything you have to weight the pros and cons of a larger purchase like that
DIY,not_removed,my house was built in this is how my kitchen and bath outlets work one gfci in each room and the rest look regular if any one of the outlets trips they all go out just as if they were all gfci units
DIY,not_removed,not horrible at all local place or big box looks like a decent length
DIY,not_removed,good to hear oddly my master bathroom gfi is connected to my second bathroom and then on to our outside outlet im not sure why they did it the way they did
DIY,not_removed,well looks like i wasted some money on cgfis
DIY,not_removed,home depot they were having a off sale at the time i think they have them quite often
DIY,not_removed,my bath outlets are the same i thought it was super weird at first but they work fine like that
DIY,not_removed,you can spend money or time a savings in one is usually a cost in the other instead of diy try bifl buy it for life find something that is of great quality and make sure you hang on to it until it becomes cheap bwcause you never had to replace it in particular boots are nothing to cheap out on i took the leap on some redwings theyre probably the best thing i own in terms of quality and theyre certainly the only pair of multi year footwear ive ever owned spend the money and save your time
DIY,not_removed,check ebay for military issue boots probably find some at a good price cheaper than commercial hunting boots but still high quality
DIY,not_removed,i bought a pair of terra work boots for under twenty dollars they were factory seconds and i still to this day cant find the flaw in them look for factory outlets in your area and you may find something
DIY,not_removed,the investment not only in a long lasting pair but ones with good support you will look back upon fondly
DIY,not_removed,i ordered a pair of llbean plain toe engineer boots three years ago i contacted them about a month ago asking that they be repaired i explained to the rep that i dont want to take advantage of the situation and will gladly shell out another for a new pair she told me not to worry about it and i had a brand new pair within a couple days ll bean has amazing customer service and i highly recommend them

DIY,not_removed,i just finalized my order of custom built station boots from nicks they sent me a try on pair and the quality is amazing even compared to my heritage redwings
DIY,not_removed,i appreciate it and youre probably right i should spend the money on a good pair i was just hoping i could trade the money for time which i have plenty of but then theres skill too and i definitely dont have that
DIY,not_removed,i meant inexpensive easily obtained my apology i mispoke
DIY,not_removed,do you have a military surplus store in your area or look around on the net theyve got some pretty tough boots
DIY,not_removed,itll be the net because the surplus store here has nothing for boots cheapest and all too small
DIY,not_removed,beautiful work the tile patterns together are a bit busy for me but im a boring dude
DIY,not_removed,good job but fuck my tastes are far from yours
DIY,not_removed,as someone who installs tile for a living id just like to say this looks really good for an amateur showers are the hardest to do when it comes to tiling
DIY,not_removed,me oh no another diy shower flipping through pictures please water proof please water proof please water proof yes waterproofing good job op this shower will last years very nice work how long did it take you and what were your costs
DIY,not_removed,ive got marble bitch to clean i highly recommend rubbing alcohol and razor scrapper
DIY,not_removed,wow great job what does that sink do when turned on
DIY,not_removed,havent seen someone use a mud bed in ages i gave in to the schluter craze a few years back
DIY,not_removed,great job nice tile work some tips if you dont want them you can ignore ive found the prefab brazilian cherry wood to scratch easily so rugs for all the things if possible i also have a glass sink like that and it is tough to keep looking clean oh you used this once better have water spots you may want to consider swapping out with a basin thats more opaque or maybe experiment with making that basin more opaque
DIY,not_removed,i love it quite often i dislike the changes here this one is awesome
DIY,not_removed,that looks great but i hate the sink and faucet would not complain about loving there
DIY,not_removed,the wood flooring looks great but are you afraid of warping due to waterhumidity even laminate can warp
DIY,not_removed,i think the original bathroom was better who wouldnt want an old moldy shower
DIY,not_removed,i will never understand why people dont prefer a little privacy while in the shower
DIY,not_removed,looks great one suggestion i have for you is to paint the walls the same color as the tiles so that it all blends in i think that would look much better
DIY,not_removed,this deserves far more upvotes than its getting that was a lot of work and it turned out wonderful
DIY,not_removed,what are the dots of painters tape on the tiles for
DIY,not_removed,i am just about done with my remodel need to finish the shower tile and install the shower door question did you install the shower door yourself ive heard it can be tricky i just have a standard wide opening so i am thinking i can do it myself
DIY,not_removed,how do you keep the tile to stand on the wall while tiling i keep looking at diy posted no one has post a picture of that yet
DIY,not_removed,awesome
DIY,not_removed,you mention using lash clips for leveling but did you use the lash wedges to actually level it out or were the clips used strictly as spacers just did my floors with this system happy i used it
DIY,not_removed,so you turned the junction box area back into a closet
DIY,not_removed,i just laid down in my kitchen god damn i wish i had known about that lash stuff before i started
DIY,not_removed,looks great really pro for a diy my only concern would be the humidity ruining that beautiful hardwood over time i know more hw is made to be resistant and all but i would hate to see such a nice job goto waste
DIY,not_removed,really not bad at all for someone that doesnt know what hes doing
DIY,not_removed,ok estimated total how much did this cost you i have the exact old shower you have i really am thinking about going tile and do you know of any cheaper ways to complete this after you have finished it
DIY,not_removed,very nice what is that roller tool in the pictures where youre laying the floor
DIY,not_removed,not my color pallet but this is beautifully executed
DIY,not_removed,i wish i could redo my crap plastic shower into something like this
DIY,not_removed,this seems less like a remodel and more like a rebuild you gutted that place to where it wasnt recognizable as a bathroom looks fantastic like a spa
DIY,not_removed,it looks like you got your tile from arizona tile
DIY,not_removed,the tile on the bottom looks kinda funky
DIY,not_removed,somebody never cleaned that old shower god damn that is disgusting
DIY,not_removed,the patterns and colors clash like crazy
DIY,not_removed,thank you very much i underestimated how delicate marble can be to cut many cuts ended up ruining the tile if i hit a weak spot in the marble veining if you were to look up close youd see the errors particularly the grout line on the bottom course of tile
DIY,not_removed,im also a professional setter i do mostly highend custom remodel showers this is by far the most thorough and well done homeowner shower i have seen though im not a fan of wedi so much you did it right
DIY,not_removed,showers are the hardest to do when it comes to tiling why is that
DIY,not_removed,thanks it took about months working casually total costs around
DIY,not_removed,just finished my own diy shower didnt waterproof
DIY,not_removed,oxyclean seems to cut the soap scum pretty well without etching the marble using the squeegee on the glass and walls helps as well
DIY,not_removed,water comes out its almost like a waterfall coming off of the glass from the center stem
DIY,not_removed,and i bet you never looked back schluter is the best thing to ever happen to tile guys
DIY,not_removed,i thought about using a wedi pan but they were too expensive i havent gotten on the schluter craze yet wedi is too easy to work with
DIY,not_removed,thanks for the tips i do have several rugs in there as far as the sink youre right it does show water spots the minerals in my tap water left some residue on the faucet as well another issue i have with the sink is how easy it chips i already have several chips on the edge from lightly brushing a ring against it by accident
DIY,not_removed,thats an interesting idea given they buried a junction box behind the plastic shower surround im guessing they didnt give safety a lot of thought
DIY,not_removed,jatoba is highly rot resistant and has a tight grain so unless the room was constantly moist or had standing water all the time i doubt it will have problems anytime soon if its engineered then theres further water resistance
DIY,not_removed,cant you just lock the bathroom door
DIY,not_removed,i walk around the house naked why would i need privacy in the shower
DIY,not_removed,or a couple shades darker
DIY,not_removed,thanks
DIY,not_removed,i used lash clips to keep the tile level i used the tape to protect the marble from being scratched by the clips
DIY,not_removed,i did install it myself i had the dimensions of the enclosure in hand as i built the shower so i knew where all the blocking had to be the seal strips for the bottom of the door had to be trimmed because they were too wide to let the door open freely my one disappointment with the kit was the seal around the bottom of the door sometimes will let water pool on the outside of the rail
DIY,not_removed,you can see i used a ledger board here
DIY,not_removed,using different paint colors might help break the contrast better than tiling to the ceiling i went with a lighter color because the room is small
DIY,not_removed,of course the clips without the wedges wouldnt have done much leveling
DIY,not_removed,the junction box is behind the toilet covered in a blanking plate
DIY,not_removed,it was around cheaper ways to complete buy a used wet saw i bought an on ebay for use cheap ceramic tile a plastic shower pan and cementboard instead of wedi find cheap shower glass go to a local granite shop and ask for remnants you could use for a curb two things you dont want to skip on are redguard or hydroban to waterproof and i always recommend starquartz epoxy grout never stains or cracks
DIY,not_removed,its a heavy roller used for flooring i couldnt find the right flooring nailer for this thickness of floor so i glued it down i rented the roller to really secure it it may have been overkill
DIY,not_removed,why not
DIY,not_removed,yes definitely have to cut marble real slow even with a kit shower mud beds rarely come out right been doing it for yrs
DIY,not_removed,this looks like shit you hired a pro and called it your own
DIY,not_removed,thanks i know its not a conventional set up to have wedi walls and a mud pan i definately agree that in some cases the wedi does flex ill be posting another album of my other bathroom and some walls did did bow the wedi out a bit as far as the sealant goes i personally have doubts about kerdi fabric being adhered with thinset and that being waterproof thanks for the kind words
DIY,not_removed,generic is the active ingredient in oxyclean oxyclean used to contain a greater percentage of the active ingredient when it was new however after aggressive marketing and brand name recognition they replaced it mostly with baking soda and blue crystals
DIY,not_removed,this its a very hard wood that is somewhat water resistant i still do make an effort to keep it from getting wet
DIY,not_removed,someone might need to brush their teeth
DIY,not_removed,thanks
DIY,not_removed,hahaha was just curious i know can be used solely as spacers bathroom looks great shower looks really great this is my next project
DIY,not_removed,time money skillsetim pretty sure id spend a bunch of money on materials then completely screw it up somehow lol
DIY,not_removed,totally lying on the internet makes him much more accomplished in life
DIY,not_removed,totally i wonder how many other bathrooms he pretends he did by himself
DIY,not_removed,let me start by saying if you do it right then it is a solid system i dont like the fact it relies on their sealant for it to be waterproof thats an area that may fail if your studs move too muchespecially here in ca with earthquakes the panels are flexible which is nice for installing but not ideal for longevity to set your walls plumb you either have to shim all your studs or float with thinset as you go neither is ideal lastly it used to be that wedi only guaranteedwarranted your shower if installed by someone certified by them im not sure if that is still the case though as i dont use their product almost ever although relatively doing tile for years i much prefer the old school method of hot mopping a pan paperlathe and float the walls for homeowners though wedi is a decent system you just have to pay very close attention to detail when waterproofing
DIY,not_removed,i knew there was a change in the formula its not as good as it used to be so i just use it like normal oxyclean
DIY,not_removed,thanks feel free to hit me with any questions another great resource is httpwwwjohnbridgecomvbulletin the site has a help section which is frequented by many talented knowledgeable professionals
DIY,not_removed,it took a long time learning and perfecting my photoshop skills to put myself in the pictures
DIY,not_removed,im not sure since i havent compared them in so long i would play it safe and assume about or as much to start if youre worried about damaging things another awesome one i found that gets rid of hard water stains and caramelized oil on pans is its about half that price in the store and no added fragrances or other garbage
DIY,not_removed,to be fair that could be anyone in the pictures dosent have to be you
DIY,not_removed,oh thats brilliant ive seen bar keepers friend in stores but never thought to try it aww yea my house is gonna be so clean
DIY,not_removed,the plaster that repaired a large patch in my home suggested an oil based primer as the first coat the oil based primer allows moister to pass through while latex and acrylics form a barrier and will crack or peel i didnt like using oil primer because of the smell and cleanup but its held up for years i did use a regular water based interior paint for the top coat fyi i tried the peelstopping primers on a garage door it reminded me of a rubber cement coating and left an unsandable and gooey surface
DIY,not_removed,hi gary done this a few times in my place i recommend coats of zinsser plus and then topcoat of whatever you like no need for undercoats etc if you decide upon this product make sure its the plus version of zinsser as the updated formulation is much stronger advantages water based so easy cleanup stain blocker so great for covering waterstains and nonwhite fillers the top coat over the zinsser will have a very uniform finish and will look far better than it would over a mist coat on the plaster disadvantages cost
DIY,not_removed,my last house was built in and we used regular paint and primer just like you would buy at menards or any store it gave us no problems at all stay away from oil base unless you are outdoors or protecting from water
DIY,not_removed,thanks i had a quick look at the website for a local diy chain and they sell primer undercoat and primer and undercoat is it just the primer i need to apply before the topcoats
DIY,not_removed,i hadnt no there isnt any woodwork other than a skirting board so im not sure a picture rail would look right its quite a small room too
DIY,not_removed,thanks for the recommendation that stuff looks great but you werent kidding about the cost looks like i would need £ worth
DIY,not_removed,yes its quite strange its my mothers old house and i vaguely remember that room being redecorated as a bedroom for my brother so we could each have our own room and that there was something not right with the paint because it went streaky and fell off in a few places i shall take your advice and be careful with the old paint hopefully taking off the loose paint and starting over will sort out whatever the problem was
DIY,not_removed,i can tell you what i did a friend suggested and he was pretty confident about what he was saying he might have also been drunk anyways went to home depot and got and i got this one cause i used for the posts then i just drilled a hole on the concrete block and inserted the elevated post base then the more you tighten the screw the higher the post goes should be completely up to code because the wood is not touching the footing cheap and simple
DIY,not_removed,if you wantneed a true basement functionality then the basement can be dug out this makes the home more valuable adding usable square footage and makes servicing anything down there much more pleasant
DIY,not_removed,not much most of the time people will bring in cement trucks and pour a floor pour shorings to reinforce the wall structure
DIY,not_removed,at this point i dont know if the added expense of a concrete footing would be worth it id scrape off any loose material and place a precast concrete block or if you can find one and put an adjustable telepost on top so you can make future adjustments if necessary again the slab could be pricey what i have just recently done in my house is laid down of styrofoam a vapour barrier and then built what is essentially a floating wood floor on top with and plywood be careful when working with your stone foundation they can be sensitive to change id start with a stiff brush and a vacuum cleaner before getting into spraying water at them it looks like you might have some dampness coming through the walls i would look into an interior weeping tile system that would divert any of that water into your sump pit
DIY,not_removed,a rat slab wouldnt be a bad idea its just of concrete mixed up really wet so it can pour in and settle with minimal work itll keep the rodents and moisture from coming up from underneath you could set the posts right on top once the concrete cures
DIY,not_removed,thanks for the reply how thick of a floor slab would you think
DIY,not_removed,re point i was planning on digging sonotubes down about and using that as a footing for the supports i had planned on the adjustable post as you mentioned this doesnt seem overly expensive ie less than excluding the posts unless im missing something im not looking forward to digging the holes mind you thanks for the other notes ive looked at the interior weeping tile system and will probably add that
DIY,not_removed,theres no need to dig down feet as there is no frost concern on the inside of your basement undisturbed soil is all you need scraping the gravel away would probably do it a brand new house would only have a pad underneath a post like this
DIY,not_removed,thanks
DIY,not_removed,did you end up trading it for an ounce of weed
DIY,not_removed,tea leaves is that a code word for the devils lettuce
DIY,not_removed,a lot of people dont know this but you can put your weed in there
DIY,not_removed,very beautiful great job
DIY,not_removed,thats clever doing it on acrylic first to check the alignment few things suck more than finding out things were out of alignment and destroying a piece you already started working on
DIY,not_removed,came out really nice there i bet having the laser to cut out the inlays and inserts really makes you appreciate the oldfashioned way of doing it where it was all done by hand your way is much much cleaner though
DIY,not_removed,impressive
DIY,not_removed,beautiful
DIY,not_removed,i want one
DIY,not_removed,beautiful piece the inlays are awesome
DIY,not_removed,tea leaves id buy one
DIY,not_removed,im trying to figure out why you took pictures of your screen instead of taking screenshots
DIY,not_removed,this is really really sexy love this i just emptied my miter saw bag full of walnut sawdust i didnt know how cool a bunch of it looks until i emptied it
DIY,not_removed,your shop is the type of shop i aim to have what sort of laser and mill setup do you have
DIY,not_removed,really nice looking a great tea caddy is a thing of beauty do you have any suggestions for resources on doing this kind of small box work
DIY,not_removed,very nice
DIY,not_removed,eat ass
DIY,not_removed,lol tea suuuuuuure
DIY,not_removed,you are so talented
DIY,not_removed,ah ha thats what i came to say have your up vote edit that is a bangin box op dont want to diminish that
DIY,not_removed,terrible way to store weed in glass vacuum sealed in the fridge lets you get a bulk discount and keeps the last hit as dank as the first
DIY,not_removed,found the dad
DIY,not_removed,small box work seems to be essentially the same as large box work but with much tighter tolerances i used a pair of digital calipers instead of a ruler for example and was still off in a few places make lots of test cuts measure measure measure
DIY,not_removed,whats the reference
DIY,not_removed,breaking bad jessie went on this tirade about a wooden box he made and subsequently traded this explanation does it no justice
DIY,not_removed,ohhh
DIY,not_removed,was amazing until you painted it i think it would look a lot better with a simple wood finish but thats just me any plans for your home made cnc
DIY,not_removed,your submission has been removed please wait until you have a completed project before posting to rdiy see the httpswwwredditcomrdiywikiguidelines for more information if you believe this is a mistake please thank you
DIY,not_removed,op i will happily be the first to say that your sub box is cool as hell well done have you already done the wiring up how does it sound
DIY,not_removed,i have been considering doing a similar style one for my there was a guy making them on a forum for like bucks and you can buy one for like but still gotta buy the sub and amp how many hours do you think it took to go from your wood block cutout to the wiring phase of the woofer
DIY,not_removed,but where will you hide your weed now
DIY,not_removed,this is awesome
DIY,not_removed,nicest sub in this sub
DIY,not_removed,where did you learn to build enclosures like this with fibreglass how did you start off where would you suggest a beginner to start thank you in advance and great work
DIY,not_removed,did you include an amp
DIY,not_removed,x post to rmini i have the same you lost no space its pretty amazing
DIY,not_removed,just gonna nitpick you made a sub box but you in no way verified that it was of the correct value making the box is great and all but unless youve simulated the box and designed it to be the right volume its going to sound like trash and potentially damage the driver so the question im left with is how the fuck do you do this process but also ensure the right enclosure volume also for a sealed subwoofer you dont need to get it that dead on but you should still be within half a cubic foot if you hope to achieve the right sound you also want to brace the inside of the box as much as you can to prevent flexing and you want to stuff the inside with damping material for sealed enclosures
DIY,not_removed,i love this so much ive wanted to make fiberglass boxes forever but im scared to screw it up also i have two of those subs in the version theyre nice
DIY,not_removed,good job i like the wood plug to get your shape creative way of doing it
DIY,not_removed,i love it but you shouldve used a better sub brand lol
DIY,not_removed,very nice work i hate working with fiberglass tried to just make a stand alone box once out of glass didnt work out very well ill stick to the mdf
DIY,not_removed,am i the only one who saw the headline on the front page and was disappointed it wasnt an underwater enclosure for the whole car
DIY,not_removed,all this time and effort just to play darude sandstorm with more bass im sure your neighbors will love you
DIY,not_removed,great thank you the little inch pounds in the sealed enclosure and gives a great depth to bass in that little car ive done a lot of this kind of work so i expected it would go okay but im pretty pleased with it
DIY,not_removed,i will be the second to say your sub box is cool as hell
DIY,not_removed,so this is something i did not have a template for at all in my research i was unable to find anyone who did something similar if you count all the prep and design time along with finding a good sub combo that works in the air volume available to me this is probably about hours of active work with dry times not included ive done a number of fiberglass enclosures this one was by far the most complex normally a lot less goes into it and could make one in half the time the materials probably cost me close to before the subwoofer
DIY,not_removed,finally someone takes a stand hippo lives are important
DIY,not_removed,so ive always been a student of youtube for diy projects theres a guy named mark that has a channel called car audio fabrication thats a great place to learn ive always worked on my own stuff though with regard to car audio speaker radio and subwoofer installs will be how you make any side money this sort of work is so labor intensive youd be hard pressed to find anyone that can afford what its worth to pay you if your goal is anything other than fun
DIY,not_removed,yes i did space is so limited in this car it had to live under the driver seat crutchfield has an inhouse brand called sound ordinance and they make a very tiny amp that produces about w rms it was the smallest one i could fine with any measure of power and ive been very happy with it
DIY,not_removed,i probably will glad to hear your mini is sticking in there at high mileage mine is coming up on just have him a new clutch and replaces the supercharger oil runs like a dream
DIY,not_removed,i do actually have a way to make sure that i got the volume right but i did not include in the post because i figured it was too lengthy and this is a diy sub reddit not a car audio one because of that i figured it wouldnt be super interesting to most people ive built the initial form and then filled it with water with an approximate volume so i would need from there i created the standoff lengths and once i had everything built i was pretty close to the value i needed i filled it with water and took a final measurements which was oversize and then from there i filled the base of the box with resin to compensate for the extra volume the exact volume is not that important either for this sub manufacture gives a pretty fair tolerance for box volume also with the padding i found it sounded better without so i didnt include it
DIY,not_removed,next project
DIY,not_removed,have you ever listened to music in a car with a decent sub setup almost all music sounds better from pop to rock to acoustic to the more obvious stuff like hip hop and dance music
DIY,not_removed,yeah because minis dont come with a volume knob or anything
DIY,not_removed,fair enough that is really not all that bad the box design for the mazda is more like your first step just the portion you used the wood as a mold for do you think that would even be enough air space to work with
DIY,not_removed,someones gotta do it
DIY,not_removed,gotcha im trying g to figure out the procedure for my car though i have no idea how to go about it car is a daily driver and i have no garage plus my enclosure needs to be like cubic feet and thats fucking huge if i want it ported and honestly ported would be better for sound
DIY,not_removed,have you ever listened to music in a car with a decent sub setup almost all music sounds better from pop to rock to acoustic to the more obvious stuff like hip hop and dance music im sure it does sound much better but the majority of the time people who have subs in their car are people who just want to wind down their window blast out their darude and piss everyone in the neighborhood off
DIY,not_removed,so it depends entirely on the type of sub youre going for every manufacturer will post a data sheet with the subs they manufacture and they give show necessary volumes a good way to test how much space you have to work with is to mock up a solid shape youd be comfortable with in a dense foam then seal it with some scotch guard once its watertight you can do a water displacement test to figure out the volume you have to work with approximately from there you can start researching sub woofers that would work with a box that sizethe right sub for the space will always sound better and hit harder then something to large that you tried to cram in you also have to be cognizant of the fact the internal supports volume of the sub woofer that is inside of the box and the thickness of the box itself will reduce that volume
DIY,not_removed,goddamn thats enormous what are you trying to put in
DIY,not_removed,im going to call confirmation bias on that one you arent going to notice all the people with decent sq systems or even the people who are into spl but arent knobs about it
DIY,not_removed,that water test is a pretty good idea and doesnt seem too complicated thanks for the info
DIY,not_removed,inch dayton ultimax dvc tuned to about but if i go sealed i dont need to worry as much about that for the majority of my music i just need and higher but thats a to cubic foot enclosure sealed
DIY,not_removed,why does it need to be tuned so low i thought much below about was a bit pointless
DIY,not_removed,nope below more like but i have a few albums that get to all the time
DIY,not_removed,around is the range of human hearing but you cant still feel frequencies below thats as vibrations tuning subwoofers for subsonic isnt uncommon
DIY,not_removed,is considered the low end of human hearing fyi im pretty sure most of what i listen to doesnt drop below
DIY,not_removed,no photo
DIY,not_removed,mechanically splice the wire apply flux then solder the wire
DIY,not_removed,a while back its pretty easy to drill pilot holes through the boards and anchor them down with long wood screws

DIY,not_removed,they usually have a wood strip between the drywall and block i have used long tapcons with success
DIY,not_removed,x on the inside of the exterior walls are called firring strips avoid hanging heavier stuff from them unless you drill into the cinder block wall masonry bits and tapcon screws
DIY,not_removed,if they used metal studs in the other interior walls my guess is that they used metal hat channel furring strips running horizontally for the drywall as opposed to wood in this case you will will probably have to put a tapcon masonry screw all the way into the concrete if you want to securely hang anything more than about unless you can spread the load across two or more screw type wall anchors since as you mentioned there is not enough depth for anything like a toggle bolt or expanding wall anchor

DIY,not_removed,if you still have the wires in the electrical box code says you need to make the wires accessible you can get a blank plate like this you can buy them from any home depot or lowes if you are able to remove all the electrical wiring and i mean completely remove it back to the breaker not just leaving it inside the walls then you can remove the electrical box and patch it with some drywall
DIY,not_removed,you can get blanks to fill the hole
DIY,not_removed,you can buy drywall and stuff called drywall joint compound or just drywall mud from most hardware stores
DIY,not_removed,drywall patches are super easy drill a piece of wood on the back of the existing drywall to act as a backer for the patch drill the patch into the piece of wood tape the seams mudsand mudsand maybe mudsand again feathering more each time paint looking at maybe if you have to buy drywall mud tape and putty knife
DIY,not_removed,got a link
DIY,not_removed,home depot and lowes carry double joist hangers an angle joist hangers would not pass inspection if those stores dont have any in stock a lumber yard usually sells them inside
DIY,not_removed,snag one off of amazon with prime shipping should be depending on joist size search for double concealed face joist hanger remember to make an amazon smile account and select your favorite charity
DIY,not_removed,seems legit
DIY,not_removed,yes they have double hangers but they arnt like the ones in the picture the ones in stock go out on the sides instead of in how could i use the one that goes out on the side on the end joist that i attach the stairs to
DIY,not_removed,i ended up doing this i really wanted to get a good portion of it done over the holiday but i guess ill have to wait
DIY,not_removed,lowes has them but they may not be in stock httpwwwlowescomsearchsearchterminvertedflangejoisthanger if you are in dire need for one try calling a deck builder since they will have them on their truck
DIY,not_removed,people kept saying youre spending your vacation doing your bathroom my answer was if i dont do it on a week off it aint getting done anyway the refresh took a full week and then a few hours here and there over the next week when i went back to work ill also say that im pretty lazy and usually only worked about hours a day before collapsing onto the couch with a beer
DIY,not_removed,wow nice thank you for the playbyplay how satisfying it must be to use your shiny new palace i enjoyed walking through your art because thats what it is to someone like me whos afraid to tackle such a job but has a sad bathroom
DIY,not_removed,in process of adding the tub surround rest has all been redone my surround took way longer neeed to shim out both endsadd support at the long side also had a window that i removed real pita im tiling back flush on one side and bull nose on the other how did you do the drywall flush mine stated not to cover the nail flange did you just shave some of the back off looks good
DIY,not_removed,that old floor was a nightmare i think the new one looks great out of curiosity how far apart are the tiles spaced
DIY,not_removed,what is shark bite
DIY,not_removed,id have no problem dropping the kids off at the pool here seriously though good work
DIY,not_removed,good work and good job on keeping costs contained im in the midst of a couple bath renos and im finding it hard to stay on budget you got a really nice look and finish for a decent price thats a really good thing
DIY,not_removed,absolutely lovely
DIY,not_removed,ive been redoing my bathrooms i actually find tiling to be kind of therapeutic just me
DIY,not_removed,thanks i may actually use this bathroom more now its the closest one to the main living area in the house but ive always walked right past it to use our master bath because this one was so nasty i truly dont believe i let us live with it for so long the kids use this bathroom but also guests because like i said its the closest bathroom to the main living area i cant imagine what guests were thinking while they were in there
DIY,not_removed,i just covered the flanges i didnt shave it technically the drywall above the tub is not perfectly plumb but its only out of plumb by about over the from the surround to the ceiling its not noticeable the one thing they did right when they built this place was framing im always surprised how square everything is i have done this surround and one in the shower in my master and neither needed shimming at all they just went right up
DIY,not_removed,the new floor its a sheet of vinyl it just looks like tile i fell in love with it at my parentsinlaws house i was sitting there admiring their tile and then realized it was vinyl i thought well next time i do flooring im using this i used the same stuff in my other bathroom i spruced up a couple years ago
DIY,not_removed,plumbing fittings that snap together rather than needing to be soldered literally takes seconds to make a connection now they aint cheap maybe or per fitting and more for specialized ones like the sink shutoff which was but the expense totally makes up for the lack of hassle and yes they are secure they are rated permanent and can be closed up inside of walls
DIY,not_removed,do they still make it or have you had it a long time my youngest is so we may have had this box for or years just keep refilling
DIY,not_removed,yes while i get a great sense of satisfaction always after a couple of days i lose steam and just want it to be done the worst for me is drywall mud if i could get someone to do that life would be better and i might find it more therapeutic
DIY,not_removed,thats really surprising i hear vinyl flooring and i still picture a glossy plasticky tackylooking floor your work turned out awesome op
DIY,not_removed,looks great does it have a name id be interested in using this stuff myself
DIY,not_removed,awesome good to know
DIY,not_removed,i think the key is to do it as a side project in a room that doesnt need a timeline to be done when i last did it it was in my basement bathroom that no one ever used so i took as long as i needed
DIY,not_removed,i wish that was the case in my case this is our main bathroom used by my teenage kids and guests the kids were showering in our master for two weeks this is one reason i took the toilet out so late and put it back so early just so they wouldnt have to traipse through our bedroom to pee at am
DIY,not_removed,i like this shiny box
DIY,not_removed,now make a
DIY,not_removed,sorry to be that guy but this is mains voltage right and that metal switch isnt earthed otherwise looks great
DIY,not_removed,hot as shit in my tiny lol the struggle is real hurry up fallwinter
DIY,not_removed,thanks id seen a couple posted on rwoodworking in the past and wanted to try it it came out better than i expected and im very satisfied
DIY,not_removed,yes its plugged into the wall the toggle isnt grounded i admittedly dont know anything about electrical wiring have i done something wrong or dangerous thanks
DIY,not_removed,well the issue is that if the switch ever fails and it is metal then it could shock you by making the toggle live is it designed for mains voltage if youre in a country then if would probably just be very unpleasant if it was me id earth it or use a plastic switch although it wouldnt look as cool maybe someone else will have different advice

DIY,not_removed,looks like a failed gas cylinder used for raising and lowering the chair if you can find a make and model on the chair you might be able to order a replacement online i have an aeron that my father in law picked up at a yard sale for because it was broken i spent on a new cylinder and about minutes with a hammer to knock out the old and busted cylinder and now my home office resembles the pinnacle of late web design
DIY,not_removed,looks like you just need to pound the remains of the bottom half from the base and then either use a pipe wrench to twist the top off or if you dont have a pipe wrench take the seat off and pound out the top its pressfit in place it looks like gas cylinders are pretty much standard size so you should just need to make some basic measurements and order something off amazon or the like
DIY,not_removed,honestly speaking most chairs are adjusted once and then that is that are you needing to adjust this chair if not then dont waste your time looking for gas cylinders shove a piece of wood or metal up there play with the length then find a way to secure it maybe a piece of angle iron across the bottom
DIY,not_removed,at least it didnt go the other way there would be a lot of blood
DIY,not_removed,so i recently replaced the gas cylinder on my office chair as i wanted it to go higher for a sitstand setup i have and in the process of all the research picked up knowledge on this where the rod came out that end would be a rubber gasket and then a retaining pin to hold it all in they actually sell these parts if you want to fix the cylinder that you have but i did not do this and instead went with total replacement on my end i ordered my cylinder from chairpartsonlinecom and they are freaking awesome and i cannot say enough about them as i was trying to figure out all the height measurements that i needed here is the kit i was referencing with the rubber gasket and retaining clip i do not work for this company but again my experience was awesome with them
DIY,not_removed,or poop
DIY,not_removed,how about a few strategically placed red spotlights to augment their color with some green lights nearby too it might read christmas
DIY,not_removed,high temp red spray paint
DIY,not_removed,you could try getting some skinny red balloons and stretching them over the end of the bulbs not sure how well it would work or if it would be worth the hassle though
DIY,not_removed,can the light shine through that and leds dont give off any real heat
DIY,not_removed,theyre like little pistols heh
DIY,not_removed,yes they can
DIY,not_removed,to which is that lol
DIY,not_removed,they can shine through dont worry
DIY,not_removed,its worth a shot hopefully i can get a small amount thanks for the tip

DIY,not_removed,rdifuckingweird
DIY,not_removed,while scrolling through the gallery my thought was how is this a diy i havent seen any building then i got to the bottom and went oh my gawd that is one ugly shelf but its creative
DIY,not_removed,this is the most ridiculous project and write up i have ever seen love it
DIY,not_removed,oh come on you gotta find a way to watch it
DIY,not_removed,that is fucking hilarious youre going to store your blurays on it right
DIY,not_removed,this is kinda awesome
DIY,not_removed,oh mannn you got my hopes up
DIY,not_removed,looks good you should make a false wall for that hidden shelf
DIY,not_removed,did you just bury the light back in there doesnt that break a few codes
DIY,not_removed,i disconnected it before the wall went up part of my rewire of the outlet
DIY,not_removed,was there more to this
DIY,not_removed,i would have someone come hold it down while you screw something such as a block of wood above it to hold it down and also lock it for now thats what i would do and have done in the past worked for me
DIY,not_removed,hire a professional you can get seriously hurt messing with that some things arent worth saving a few bucks this is one of them
DIY,not_removed,be careful i disconnected the cable from one side of my door old wood to repair it and it basically self destructed when i opened and closed it that way your door being newer and aluminum or vinyl hopefully wont do that
DIY,not_removed,unless you know what you are doing dont mess with the torsion spring or cables you can be seriously injured or killed since you are asking the question on here i will assume that you are not familiar with the workings of the door it is crooked because of the uneven pressure with only having one side attached from the picture it appears there is a small hole on the track on the right hand side have someone hold the door down and then jam a screwdriver into the hole so that it holds the guide wheel down do not cut the cable or loosen the screw without being certain of what you are doing there is a lot of energy stored in that spring
DIY,not_removed,buddy of mine does this work for a living he had a friend get killed fucking with the overhead spring its just not worth it it cost me bucks to fix my door when it did what ops did
DIY,not_removed,what jamesinsl said do not mess with that door unless you know what youre doing that remaining spring on a damaged door is a bear trap waiting to be sprung get a tarp and some duct tape to close the opening or just let it exposed until a qualified person gets there ive worked with these things not a pro but i am an experienced industrial engineer and former maintenance tech we often have to work on stuff were not familiar with or trained on learning when to not to mess with something is a survival skill
DIY,not_removed,honestly if you dont know what youre doing with it i would just purchase a piece of plywood and cover the opening that way for the time being until you get it fixed those things can kill you as fast as lightning if you do the wrong thing at the wrong time
DIY,not_removed,listen to the other people here telling you to hire someone i diy almost everything but garage doors are something i never touch i had the same thing happen to one of mine they charged me to replace a spring level the door out and do a bunch of other adjustments
DIY,not_removed,additionally count the number of times you turn it to release the tension then reapply the same amount of tension turns when you go back after replacing the cable torsion springs are no joke but with a little healthy respect of the amount of stored energy youre dealing with its not bad
DIY,not_removed,torsion spring connects directly to the door the red cord just disconnects the door from the motor that wont help him at all op is there no manual bolt on the door that can keep the door down until fixed
DIY,not_removed,truth garage door springs and cables will seriously mess you up one of the guys at my company who is a professional with many years of experience had and accident a few months back and took a cable to the face ended up with fractures and lacerations from which he will most likely miss months of work i wish i could post a picture of it here but im not sure he would appreciate that very much
DIY,not_removed,the torsion springs provide counterbalance for the door without one connected that side of the door is heavier with or without the opener connected
DIY,not_removed,really really bad idea
DIY,not_removed,hmmi would have painted first with latex paint then put a lighter stain over one the paint has dried for hours so the paint comes through stronglet the stain dry completely then sealmaybe seal with a spray sealer instead of a brush on although when i made my corn hole boards i def used brush onbut i painted then stained i do think you have to strip the one you already didor just sand everything offdo you have a palm sander shouldnt be too hard for the others i would try a spray on sealer and see if that works ok you already have the magnets in right
DIY,not_removed,thanks for the help i have a cat sander that i can use to take the top off of the one i already did and will try a spray sealant for the other ones the magnets are already installed and i sealed the back of them no problem since there was no paint the only other step was attach the actual bottle opener once they were sealed
DIY,not_removed,good luckwe had the devil of a time getting our magnets in this is our current diymainly bc i told my daughter she was making it for her bf to be very carful sliding that second one into placeshe was but it still jumped out of her hand and flipped over on top of the first one we spent an hour trying to get them separated before we were successful it was hilarious though we then put a heavy piece of wood on top of the first one before placing the second onethis morning we are taking it offwe will see what happens
DIY,not_removed,i only used one magnet one really big neodynium magnet for each one it holds it on to the fridge and catches all of the caps i added small regular magnets at the top for a little stability but honestly didnt need to my big issue was finding an adhesive strong enough to hold the magnets in the first time i tried they ripped out and were just on the fridge
DIY,not_removed,great build and for one of the best reasons possible its so nice to see somebody looking after these years long friends of ours rather than disposing of them after they quit being puppies mine live at home catered to until they die last one was the one before was thanks this made me smile
DIY,not_removed,being the owner of a geriatric dog who is not feeling well today this gives me ideas
DIY,not_removed,i love it geriatric dogs definately pull at my heart strings
DIY,not_removed,lovely idea im a vet and cant help but ask if shes on any medication i find nsaids can really help maintain a comfortable older dog likely worth trialling a veterinary prescription product if shes not already on one
DIY,not_removed,just use the legs as stilts for your dog

DIY,not_removed,in the orange arrows you can see the failed attempts to drill holes the pink line is where the curtain rod would he positioned i cant drill the wall because there is no wall available in the other side its a degree window see

DIY,not_removed,for startersonly wire the on terminal that are closest to the arm then you could either make the throw of the arm so that it only pushes the switch to the off position or bridge the connections of the off and the second on so that both of the positions positive terminals are connected and both of the positions negative terminals are connected or you could buy a new switch which is cheap but unnecessary sorry if this was hard to follow feel free to pm me any questions
DIY,not_removed,i believe the lever switch is there to keep power applied while the little arm is moved back to the start position which is why i have the two switches in parallel when the toggle switch is turned off by the arm the lever switch remains closed until it moves back to its starting position if you have a question let me know good luck edit i realized i made a mistake on the toggle switch the change would be to move the yellow to the off same side as the red so red on one of the on posts and yellow on one of the off posts both on the same side
DIY,not_removed,yeah it was kinda hard to follow what do you mean with the closest to the arm and i tried to understand what you meant with bridging like this if this isnt what you mean could you please take the time to draw my template i would really appreciate it and thanks for the help you already gave me you are really nice thanks
DIY,not_removed,thanks man really appreciate it
DIY,not_removed,okay tried it didnt work it only rotates one way so it cant go back in the box thanks anyways for everything really appreciate it that you took the time
DIY,not_removed,do you have pictures of the interior mechanicals
DIY,not_removed,no didnt get to take pictures its really hard to do so its just like your schematic
DIY,not_removed,did some research found a manual for the the on connections may need to be swapped depending on how the switch is physically installed also since you have a onoffon instead of an onon switch the motor needs to push past the off detent if it doesnt you may need an onon switch because for that one moment when the switch is in the off position there is no power to the motor and the forward momentum of the arm needs to push the switch past the off detent let me know if this works
DIY,not_removed,i love that you got a gold with no comments and upvotes beautiful i love it i want to build one now too this should be a subreddit people post their cats and their tanks
DIY,not_removed,you need to set this on top of a roomba then your cat can invade in style super awesome by the way makes me want to make war machines for my cats now

DIY,not_removed,looks great try using a mineral oil and beeswax mix for further coats you can buy it premixed or make your own the finish will be nicer than oil and you wont need to oil the board as often
DIY,not_removed,beautiful wrx oh yeah the cutting board is nice too
DIY,not_removed,how about the recipe for those ribs if you dont mind
DIY,not_removed,very nice beautiful and minimalistic as is but a carved in handle may make it look very professional totally personal preference though
DIY,not_removed,that is amazing
DIY,not_removed,that looks delicious your cutting board is dope too
DIY,not_removed,those ribs literally made my stomach growlroar rfoodporn
DIY,not_removed,nice
DIY,not_removed,well ill be i was planning to do something very similar for a countertop on my entertainment center youve now given me an idea of how to do it a lot easier nicely done and thanks for the inspiration
DIY,not_removed,beautiful board a for a first try
DIY,not_removed,its ironic that you would use that optical illusion design pattern on a cutting board
DIY,not_removed,i dont eat meat but that cutting board looks delicious nice work
DIY,not_removed,thanks for the tip i used mineral oil for the base coats and then used the butcher block cleanser which the ingredients say its a mineral oil bees wax mix
DIY,not_removed,i actually modified the recipe at the last minute due to weather about the time i was going to fire up the grill it started raining so my cook time was shortened if we were to eat at a reasonable hour i tore the membrane off the back and and patted down with salt and let sit in the fridge over night rubbed in a little bit of a rub i got while visiting memphis central bbq i believe lit the lump coal in the grill ceramickamado type and cooked with indirect heat at time permitting i would have done and temps crept up a bit more than i planned after an hour or so i bathed them in blues hog bbq sauce its kind of a sweetsmokey flavor that tastes good on everything ive tried it on and let sit on the grill another let rest covered in foil while finished prepping sides and thats it wasnt the best i had done but turned out pretty good
DIY,not_removed,my original plan was to router some grooves in the sides i was undecided if i would cut a centered slot or cut a lip out of the bottom as handles but i was doing some test cuts on some scrap and kept getting burn out or the blade to grab it was a handed down routertable so pretty used didnt want to ruin the project due to my inexperienced with it so decided to pass
DIY,not_removed,glad it could help add inspiration to your project one thing to keep in mind when you layout designs is how small you want your pieces to be i had underestimated how much scrap i would end up with each cut only removes but when youre hitting every side it starts to add up i estimate i ended up with scrapdust by the end larger pieces fewer cuts would have greatly reduced the waste
DIY,not_removed,funny you could have just said nice work but had to make a passive aggressive i dont eat meat but comment thanks for sharing your superiority over us meat eatersfucking tool
DIY,not_removed,good call on being cautious i used a spiral upcut bit to make finger notches on my cutting board and it did a great job
DIY,not_removed,good call looks great as is
DIY,not_removed,good pointers ill probably go with larger pieces to create bigger chevrons im trying to make it look like one of the
DIY,not_removed,that was not passive aggressive my friend i was complimenting his work apparently i am not funny
DIY,not_removed,ill have to look and see if i have a spiral upcut to try out
DIY,not_removed,are you accounting for the thickness of the surface material
DIY,not_removed,i would be more worried about how much that thing will weigh with the frame than how long the legs are
DIY,not_removed,shit wasnt thinking about that when looking at the length but then im confused as to how the overall wouldnt get messed up when measuring the leg off the side of the table like he suggests in step
DIY,not_removed,nobodys gonna measure your cornhole set the grass alone will create more variations than the construction make it use it just keep your solo cup topped off
DIY,not_removed,true im just curious though because that step doesnt make sense to me plywood plus legs off the ground but then to cut the angle he says to drop a leg off the side of a table mark a line and cut this would lower the back end from the standard no
DIY,not_removed,you can always add a half inch on your own when doing diy you can make all the changes you like dont feel like you have to follow the instructions exactly also you can always cut the legs shorter
DIY,not_removed,i understand but im not crazy for being confused with this step right like it doesnt make sense to you either
DIY,not_removed,you never linked the original instructions so i cant say one way or the other when you make a text post the link is not used my advice is dont over think it make what makes you happy
DIY,not_removed,shit im an idiot thought i put it in the text of the post httpwwwdiynetworkcomhowtooutdoorsstructureshowtobuildaregulationcornholeset
DIY,not_removed,all right i read the instructions and by read i mean i skimmed them yes they say cut to because the plywood takes up the rest of the distance
DIY,not_removed,yea got that step is cut the leg ends to cut the angle on bottom of the leg turn the box rightside up and set it on a worktable with the legs tucked under place a block or anything that will hold it up we used a bucket under the box so that the back of the platform is inches off the tabletop slide the box to the edge of the table pull down the leg closest to the edge so that it hangs just over the table edge using the tabletop as a guide draw a straight line across the bottom of the repeat for the opposite side cut the ends off using a circular saw this would instantly make it not be no
DIY,not_removed,yes that would do it
DIY,not_removed,no because the back of the platform is inches off the table
DIY,not_removed,ok just checking thought maybe i was misreading or understanding something thanks
DIY,not_removed,former boat builder here worked there for years the pink shit is a mix of grey putty and deep red activator we had a couple of names for both the grey putty we called plexus the deep red activator was called mek we had clear colored and the deep red colored both did the same thing i believe mek was an abbreviation for methyl ethyl ketone let me know if any of this helps

DIY,not_removed,ianab but i have had homes built i honestly wouldnt think it would matter youd probably be shocked about how rough and shoddy looking some construction is but it all meets code
DIY,not_removed,op where exactly are they using the mdf you are referring to is it like this ive seen this style before was taken aback the first time i saw it at my friends place but its holding up very well over the years thus far nearly by now i think
DIY,not_removed,if you live in a city with a code enforcementbuilding inspection office call them for an inspection of the subpar siding also mdf is never used as sheathing its probably osb which is a cheap replacement for plywood
DIY,not_removed,unless you specifically contracted him to use damaged materials then no he probably got it on the cheap and pocketed the difference in cash not that it really does make a difference in structural integrity i would demand new undamaged material be used source home builder for over years

DIY,not_removed,ummm no no no mdf should never be used for framing whatsoever it should be plywood where do you see these contractors using it
DIY,not_removed,agreed an inspector approved some amazing crap including a sloped concrete pour in an addition were not talking a minor slope its a huge slope exterior doors installed backwards siding not finished under stairs no z flashing it was all signed off by the inspector anyway i came to say that i can guarantee theyre billing for brand new sheets of osb or mdf which they shouldnt be using any hole in them is a way for coldheat to enter or escape house wrap or no hell no its not acceptable
DIY,not_removed,thats not mdf
DIY,not_removed,osb isnt cheap anymore lol
DIY,not_removed,i asked for clarification but perhaps he means this style
DIY,not_removed,true but without pics of what op is talking about ill guess thats what hes thinking
DIY,not_removed,cheaper than plywood
DIY,not_removed,thats osb
DIY,not_removed,tjis
DIY,not_removed,have you tried using the microwave on a different circuit could be an issue with the microwave either way do not replace the breakers theyre tripping for a reason replacing the breaker could be a recipe for a house fire
DIY,not_removed,i feel ya man my house is being remodeled after a fire and my shed was broken into last weekend they stole my lawn mower and my pressure washer nothing pisses me off more than a thief

DIY,not_removed,yeah fucking ridiculous as you can see the handle was literally ripped out of its socket i dont understand why anyone would even break into my shed it looked like shit anyway nothing really that special on its exterior either way im installing cameras all around my house due to this little endeavour in fact the officer said i shouldve had a no trespassing sign up and cameras i think half the problem stems from the laws themselves gods damn police telling me what i did wrong like i deserved this shit or something sorry to hear about your house and wish you the best of luck
DIY,not_removed,the thing is about the cops depending on their workload unless the crook literally gets dropped into their lap odds are theyll never go looking fro the thief if have the serial numbers of the stuff that was stolen theyll put it on the list that pawn shops are supposed to check but beyond that there might be evidence that will find the guy but its just not worth it from a cost effectiveness standpoint so ounce of prevention
DIY,not_removed,the police in my area are pretty good its a construction site with a legal permit box so the cop said that if they did catch the thief the guy would be in much more trouble he also loaded up craigslist on the laptop in his car and spent minutes checking for lawnmowers
DIY,not_removed,replace the whole chair with your neighbors
DIY,not_removed,hey there homerino what can i do ya for
DIY,not_removed,i would take a fitting and test every end on every pipe before leaving home depot or where ever you get it at because they have messed up for my company beforenot my idea to subcontract and as a pipe fitter invest in some good wrenches and have some patience please post pics of progress
DIY,not_removed,if you designed it you should be able to have your local plumbing supply cut and thread all pipes per your design and then its just up to you to assemble it
DIY,not_removed,there is just in flanges the fittings are what is going to kill your costs glass can be expensive but i think the cost on this is going to surprise you
DIY,not_removed,i would suggest getting a pipe threader and a cutoff saw so you can fix any size or design issues without going to home depot the material and fittings will be expensive i would look online and check with plumbers who specialize in replumbing of houses to see if you get the pipe material they remove as for connecting larger sections together one answer to the couplers you are referring to are called hammer unions i dont know about left handed threads but maybe they can do those at the store you can use different size pipes there are reducing elbows and couplers to buy off the shelf cable management in some of the pipes is fine just make sure you are using plastic or rubber grommets where they enter and leave the pipe to reduce the risk of cutting through the insulation it would be more or less the same as running it through metal conduit or raceway it is going to expensive thousands and very heavy when you are done
DIY,not_removed,first off id like to say i really like your design i like you have looked high and low for specs and the actual physical size of fittings but alas there seems to be none at least as far as i have been able to find though im sure there is somewhere the problem with building something like this form steel pipe is that some manufacturers of fittings do not adhere to the standards when it comes to internal threads when manufacturers play fast and loose with the female threads the thread engagement will vary enough that if for example you take inch lengths of threaded pipe and attach a tee to each end tees the center of the tees may not line up if you put one on top of the other it also seems that from your images on imgur that there are special fittings involved these may be prohibitively expensive the flanges i see on ebay for under dollars each so not really to bad there are sites where you can find thread specs for each pipe size as an example steel pipe has a thread engagement of inches wrench tight so you will need to know the physical size of your fittings then you can calculate the actual lengths of pipe section you will need edit also you may run into problems with the bores of the tees not being perfectly in line and or perpendicular this will cause your frame to not be straight and true
DIY,not_removed,depending on the diameter of your pipe you choose to use you have a margin of error of about for npt pipe and fittings if you figure you have or more fittings in overall height that yields you almost inch of tolerance buy two big pipe wrenches for assembly you may find you need to crank the living hell out of some fittings to yield you the final dimensions you desire
DIY,not_removed,the fittings add up mighty quick
DIY,not_removed,i dont think youve gone overboard however the question is not the weight of the monitors which is really not that much but how much you intend to put on the shelf above the monitors you havent indicated the overall length of the desk
DIY,not_removed,go pick up a pipe trades hand book or download a copy then look up your fittings and determine your fitting allowance fa throw thread engagement your fitting allowance will vary by fitting and the size of the fitting so create a table for all your fitting allowances then you re gonna wanna use centre to centre measurements and subtract your fa for each fitting within that measurement edit ill pm you the charts you need tomorrow
DIY,not_removed,there is a standard for npt pipe fittings based on the diameter of pipe i have some jet equipment im working with today ill edit this post and take some pics of the threaded tolerances of npt fittings so you have a visual of what you will be working with should be about minutes or so
DIY,not_removed,my feeling is that your design is more than adequate for the intended purpose
DIY,not_removed,httpsimgurcombpestnn i didnt find anything to scale but those are npt threads hand tightened so theres a decent margin for error if you have pipe wrenches to adjust
DIY,not_removed,in looking at the rear view i identified floor flanges and associated nipples that i feel could be removed without weakening the overall structure they are right end between the front and rear legs same on the left end across the back the first flange and nipple in from the left end across the back the first flange and nipple in from the right end only two flanges on the ends instead of three and four flanges across back instead of six also any place you take out a floor flange you can replace the cross with a tee also in the front view on the left end i dont think you need the pipe that goes from front to back in the middle of the lower shelf however i do not know how big that area is overall nor how much weight you may intend putting on it otherwise as i posted earlier i like your design and even with the elimination of the pieces i have suggested it is still more than adequate for its intended purpose
DIY,not_removed,deep is hand tight after that you need pipe wrenches
DIY,not_removed,what about using a easel if it can hold a canvas to paint it must be able to hold a whiteboard to write
DIY,not_removed,double sided tape
DIY,not_removed,you can try sticky tack
DIY,not_removed,lbs is what i read in the weight categoryi dunno if id trust my toes to too many of those nonpuncturing fastenersnot saying there arent any just my experiences have allways been bad for anything over a picture i have no cause to have a whiteboard in particular but it seems to me that something akin to an art easel might suit your ends better that being said if you really wanna be a dick and mount it with no holes and safe toes buy some construction adhesive not the bs stuff get subfloor glue in the quart caulking gun looking container i garrauntee it wont come offeverand if it does you will see bare studs random thoughtthey have chalkboards you can literally paint on now so if the ol sheriff of naughtyham will let you paint you could have a whole wall to practice on xd
DIY,not_removed,if you want to go the cheap route go to your local home improvement store and pick up a showerboard or as big orange calls it and cut it or mount it or even just lean it up against the wall for functionalitys sake it works just as well as expensive dry erase boards

DIY,not_removed,the whiteboard used for coding in my interview was an easel i got the job heartily support this idea
DIY,not_removed,you think it would be able to carry pounds
DIY,not_removed,yes you have to look for the vhb kind
DIY,not_removed,depth is kind of irrelevant you only need to patch the surface essentially and absolutely you can patch anything but there are some things to consider type of material mainly wood is super easy take any hardening putty and match the shade of the stain at the hardware store take a pic and find the nice old guy that works there theyll do the hard work for you when you explain the situation rub it into the whole let it harden then scuff with a wool pad and done sheet rock is slightly more complicated take a little onetime mud found at any home depot and fill the hole then sand it smooth and donebuttttmatching the paint is the hard part and im here to tell you bro i have been a carpenter for years and i still have a dam hard time matching paint the paint mixing guy can get you close but anybody that deals with it on a regular basis is gonna catch it first sweep unless you paint most or all of the wall to hide the patch regardless its all about how much work you wanna put into it i guess that being said good wood screws that hit into studs will hold lbs easy peasy so you wouldnt have a ton of patches to do edit or like my wife said leave em a couple of dollar general fashion portraits on the wall when you move out
DIY,not_removed,nice i like the cool casters
