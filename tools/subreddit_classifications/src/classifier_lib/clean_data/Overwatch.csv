Overwatch,removed,indeed for some reason people conflate being attracted to year olds in a physical sense with actually having sex with them no no the reason its wrong to have sex with a or year old when youre is because they arent mature enough to understand the consequences of sex and also you having an edge in the relationship dynamic due to your maturity and experience however dating an year old girl who looks is not wrong at all if that is your cup of tea go for it its why i have a thing for asian girls especially koreans they look so young healthy youthful vibrant even in their and its incredibly attractive

Overwatch,removed,lol are console peasants really that bad that they need a console nerf lol i predict overwatch will be like on console because no one is able to react quick enough or aim accurately the peasants will drop slowly like flies and ressurrect to the pc version all competitive play and events will most definitely be pc only

Overwatch,removed,buhbye pussy boy you wont be missed have fun not playing overwatch ps youll still keep your preorder and buy it because youre just being a dramatic baby on the internet because you think your opinion matters lololol
Overwatch,removed,kill yourself lololol
Overwatch,removed,manners are for respect i have no respect over a whitney baby what is there to understand other than youre too retarded to understand that microtransactions are there for blizzard to be able to keep making money while giving out the dlc for free and because a microtransaction is there does not mean you even have to buy it they dont affect your dumb ass either way but youll still be a whiney baby too young to understand the benefits
Overwatch,removed,like i said manners are for respect i dont respect someone as downright retarded as you did i ever say the game was free i didnt huh reading must be hard i said it keeps the upcoming heroes and maps free instead of paid dlc you say you dont like season pass shit but then you cry about micro transactions lmao and you wonder why i called you a retard what do you think keeps a season passpaid dlc out of a game micro transactions its like im talking to a old man with alzheimers here it has nothing to do with not agreeing it has to do with facts you think you can ignore micro transactions are in the game either deal with it and stop pouting like a baby or dont buy the game and stop pouting like a baby its pretty pathetic when you have to dramatically post on the internet ney everyone this game has micro transactions i dont agree wth so im not gonna buy it anymore everyone attention seeking garbage funny part is youll buy the game anyway xd
Overwatch,removed,then like i said in my original comment buhbye attention seeking pussy boy no one cares that you arent buying the game with that in mind without you buying the game that should mean you should be leaving this subreddit as well seeing how whats the point on staying on a game reddit for a game you refuse to own or dont agree with unless of course like i said youre full of shit thinking your whining is going to mean anything to anyone lmao dont worry ill check your posts to see whether or not you bought it like i know youre going to anyway because the real immaturity here is you saying you wont buy something anymore because youre butthurt over one feature xd

Overwatch,removed,this has been a long time coming and i know its pretty unprovoked but i feel like typing it right now to give you guys some ammunition against thoughtpolice who want to censor sexy asses what if i told you that the male characters are actually sexualised just as much as female characters this is information i got from an unrelated post a while ago i dont have the op but i managed to find the image that came with it on google so someone redrew the avengers poster to make all the characters sexualised in the same way the black widow is her ass is visible so this is apparently sexist because the male avengers have different poses compared to the female avenger but to say that black window is sexualised and the others are not would be to assume that both genders have identitical sexuality men and women typically have drastic hormonal differences and preferences when it comes to sexualising someone female sexuality for the most fundamental part is just the selection of the alpha male the strongest most dominant man who can protect her provide her with resources and strong children thats not sexist its a biological fact women dont want to see a skinny little man with a tight waist twisted round to show off his welltoned ass that is what men want but not women women generally want men who are muscular asserting their dominance pushing out their chiselled chest wearing skintight suits that show off their rippling muscles as you can see from the picture i linked above all the male avengers present themselves as described its the same in just about any video game or any movie the male characters are often sexualised just as much as the female characters but not in the same way becuse gender sexuality is different if angry feminists actually wanted to oppose sexualisation theyd also complain about overly muscular atheltic handsom alphamen but they dont ever because they like those men they are specifically designed to appeal to women i dont have to tell you how well recieved thor was amongst the female audience and finally we shouldnt be fighting sexualisation at all because it is an essential part of what makes us human we all have it and we can all learn to just enjoy it instead of worrying about a videogame setting unobtainable standards there we go essay over men are just as sexualised as women only in a different way have fun with that

Overwatch,removed,oh i cant wait to see another reddit thread bitching about the enemy sucking being the one and only reason reddit delivers sees a reply from ubrainblowx oooooo a reply from brainblowx i hope its not retarded and he doesnt waste everyones time typing a paper over a second clip of fighting yes you are fucking full of yourself i appreciate the paper explanation on a short encounter you did a great job chronic allying the gif and explaining the ever so amazing and super duper job by symmetra here let me make t a little shorter sym full charges off of dva mech everyone fucks around with turrets as she fights soldier the she fights the next person and the next and the next and the next gosh darn youre right that whole play was obviously the super skilled symmetra with a full charge jumping back and forth and had nothing to do with five enemies running around with their heads cut off and awful aiming fuck myself and the community for daring to branding people as incompetent chimps because clearly that was t the case here no no no not at all s jesus christ i dont even give a shit about symmetra i dont play her and i dont have issues playing against her you can make whatever defense you want but she in the smallest choke imaginable the fact you think the community is childish and having knee jerk reactions because they blame it on the enemy players is hilarious to me continue to be blind and full of yourself brainblowx fails to deliver intelligent response he continues the same pattern

Overwatch,removed,wow pedophile is going a little far dont you think theres actually a very distinct reason why pedophilia is inherently wrong that has nothing to do with current standards of society simply put its considered unnatural because there isnt really any good reason to want to mate with a child im aware that humans stand out because they also mate for pleasure but we can still take this as baseline since they havent developed any secondary sexual characteristics
Overwatch,removed,haha where is genji i liked him penis gimme

Overwatch,removed,the fact that theyve hyped sombra for this fucking long and that theyre going to do the reveal not even the release at blizzcon is fucking pure bullshit and they can go fuck themselves
Overwatch,removed,titties tattoo
Overwatch,removed,j
Overwatch,removed,players who claim they are stuck in elo hell because of others
Overwatch,removed,lol dude youre such a faggot how can you even deny you said i just think bastion fits all of the tropes typical of a disney princess
Overwatch,removed,console players
Overwatch,removed,yeah you should never be toxic against trolls you should be happy and play for lose retard
Overwatch,removed,i get faggots like you every other game your whole team gets wiped without killing anyone every push and some guy decides its your personal fault for playing a bad dps or bad tank while the guy plays fucking mercy on attack and thinks hes helping
Overwatch,removed,lol console
Overwatch,removed,if you wanna play a game competitively play it on the platform its meant for cant provide a link but blizzard originally stated they didnt want overwatch for consoles
Overwatch,removed,no no one is that bad
Overwatch,removed,hah ok buddy it seems you are unwilling to believe that hanzo is a suboptimal pick for competitive i cant fix that kind of stupid
Overwatch,removed,tracer is not a dyke
Overwatch,removed,muh representation muh diversity its great though its a win win for everyone and now that theres a lesbian character there probably wont be any more hiding in the main cast god bless you blizzard for appeasing the degenerates and killing off the other shitposts what grace
Overwatch,removed,a huge amount of lore also of note is that its now confirmed tracer doesnt need her harness fanfic writers rejoice lesbian and open season on groping also of note is that pharah does appear to be in good health though we cant see her legs so she isnt in a darth vader suit amelie still openly has feelings for her late husband maybe she killed him around christmas rein is goddamned prolific and good on torb baggin that girl mccree and sombra know each other or at least frequent similar establishments
Overwatch,removed,the name should have been the tip off that hes most likely cheating
Overwatch,removed,new hero confirmed carpetmuncher
Overwatch,removed,queers love
Overwatch,removed,yeah i know fuck all those little mexican kids who are happy to see diego luna starring in a friggin star wars movie dont they know they can achieve everything they want in life and dont have anything holding them back based on their orientation religion gender race
Overwatch,removed,those of us that are around end up getting hit with the jack harkness treatment of lovable rogues who are total and complete sluts i mean its accurate in my case but
Overwatch,removed,dyke
Overwatch,removed,i guess ive never needed someone to be just like me to enjoy them as a character well sure but straight people are everywhere in media youve had representation on that point forever its not about not being able to enjoy a character that isnt just like you its about seeing your experience as a person represented in media
Overwatch,removed,hopefully some assfag did not post this before sec ago i dont want this one to be deleted
Overwatch,removed,nah im sorry we arent going to have a victim contest here who said anything about victims your experience isnt nearly as relevant as you think it is it can be for many people when a core part of your identity who you love is neglected by the population at large it can be affirming to have it represented positively in media i dont require that blizzard make openly atheist characters so that my experiences can be validated whos requiring anything
Overwatch,removed,i forgot how influential a video game character kissing another video game character of the same sex is then again degenerates dont have much to hold onto and with how common they kill themselves maybe this is their one true escape maybe i should let them have one last thing
Overwatch,removed,you cried because a character is gay that seems odd
Overwatch,removed,tracer is a lesbian fuck this game seriously you go and fucking ruin it go fuck yourself you politically correct scum go fuck yourself
Overwatch,removed,regardless of what you accomplish with your life after this just know that your asinine bigotry is now immortalised on the internet with this comment reach harder
Overwatch,removed,why is gay shit everywhere now can i just play a game or watch a movie without the lgbt community sticking there transgenatallia in it
Overwatch,removed,hanzo is buying a httpsenwikipediaorgwikichristmascake
Overwatch,removed,good children shouldnt be exposed to this degeneracy
Overwatch,removed,because its wrong
Overwatch,removed,you are bigots who post how you want to gas white people you dont deserve representation only a noose
Overwatch,removed,you can downvote the autism in the fourm but you can never take the autism out of the fourm
Overwatch,removed,i do the more the pc retards downvbote me the more right i know i am i function with the tears of butthurt sensitive millenial pc faggots i hail from a much better era where we said whatever the fuck we pleased and if you got your sensibilities offended go fucking cry me a river and deal with fucking it downvote this fucking whiny bitches
Overwatch,removed,youre a fucking idiot
Overwatch,removed,thankfully at least russia is normal enough to block this rubbish in their country
Overwatch,removed,yup you seem really triggered my lil friend and the simple fact that you are defending the intellectual marxism that is the pc culture says long about you keep being triggered kiddo ill just ignore you ive no time to wast with you
Overwatch,removed,the fags are taking over overwatch
Overwatch,removed,this is why trump won
Overwatch,removed,no such thing as homophobia also your tears were even more delicious when it was illegal for you to have your fake marriages double standard much
Overwatch,removed,she born straight if she had a mental disorder or a traumatic experience i can undertand that start whining on god the ovnis or whatever the fuck created us for doing it in that standar way if you dont like it liberal cunt
Overwatch,removed,and that reaper is a pedophile and reinhardt is into zoophilia since they seem to enjoy giving mental deviances to their characters
Overwatch,removed,do you fap to mcree on the other screen
Overwatch,removed,what the actual fuck i didnt know they allowed retards to have children dying lol dafaq is wrong with you check out rfunny if you think your offsprings humor is funny

Overwatch,removed,in all likelyhood me and many others lives would be enriched by not having them around any more were you expecting me to tell someone to kill themselves and not be pleased if they do thatd just be lying to myself
Overwatch,removed,kys
Overwatch,removed,kill yourself but seriously when my depression hits me im nowhere near games my motivation to play goes right out the window and thats just when im having a bad day when im actually to the point of considering it im not even out of bed im there all day trying not to lose my mind even if by some miracle i was playing what some shittalking bastion is saying to me is hardly going to matter to me id be thinking about whatever it is im playing to try and avoid
Overwatch,removed,did you not grow up playing games online where everyone told you that they fucked your mother if you cant handle someone saying kys then maybe you should kys

Overwatch,removed,tldr type in ¯ツ¯ for proper formatting actual reply for the ¯ツ¯ like you were trying for you need three backslashes so it should look like this when you type it out ¯ツ¯ which will turn out like this ¯ツ¯ the reason for this is that the underscore character this one is used to italicize words just like an asterisk does this guy since the face of the emoticon has an underscore on each side it naturally wants to italicize the face this guy ツ the backslash is reddits escape character basically a character used to say that you dont want to use a special character in order to format but rather you just want it to display so your first is just saying hey i dont want to italicize ツ so it keeps the underscore but gets rid of the backslash since its just an escape character after this you still want the arm so you have to add two more backslashes two not one since backslash is an escape character so you need an escape character for your escape character to displayconfusing i know anyways i guess thats my lesson for the day on reddit formatting lol caution probably very boring edit as to why you dont need to escape the second underscore read only if youre super bored or need to fall asleep edit the reason you only need an escape character for the first underscore and not the second is because the second underscore which doesnt have an escape character doesnt have another underscore with which to italicize reddits formatting works in that you need a special character to indicate how you want to format text then you put the text you want to format then you put the character again for example you would type italicize or italicize in order to get italicize since we put an escape character we have italicize and dont need to escape the second underscore since theres not another nonescaped underscore with which to italicize something in between them so technically you could have written ¯ツ¯ but you dont need to since theres not a second nonescaped underscore you would need to escape the second underscore if you planned on using another underscore in the same line but not if you used a line break aka pressed enter twice if you used an asterisk later though on the same line it would not work with the nonescaped underscore to italicize to show you this you can type italicize and it should not be italicized

Overwatch,removed,really you dont know how broken mercy is at this point its a bug that shes even in the game just the fact that you play mercy honestly sickens me when i see someone on my team pick mercy i just leave tbh easily most broken hero in the game its stupidly easy to play mercy and feel like you are helping the team when in reality you are completely and utterly useless to the team and might as well be a mercy is simply just a feelgood class for selfish people who want to feel like they are helping honestly you are the problem with overwatch waiting for the day mercy gets removed from the game would really make it playable again
Overwatch,removed,she had to clean her mouth after sucking off me last night
Overwatch,removed,well this comments section went to shit mercy is not broken lol the only support that requires you to look at your healing target is ana anyway btw in case you are feeling bad because of some antimercy hate from this thread all the other people who responded to you are httpsenwikipediaorgwikisockpuppetinternet its super obvious if you look at their post histories it also looks like the puppeteer is a kid in middlehigh school so probably just some youthful rage going on this is an assumption but based on their age quality of posts and subject of ranting like who really has a problem with mercy theyre probably not that highly ranked i mean you see less and less mercy the higher you go up especially in this meta anyway i feel like ive spent too long investigating the posting habits of a literal child so im going to stop here signed a fellow mercy player although ana is my most played support this season because op
Overwatch,removed,yeah no random group has won against a stalling team fucking retard
Overwatch,removed,just wondering here do you think about the decisions you make what are you thinking when you decide to make your flair that of mercys what is going through your mind when you decide to select mercy in a game do you feel bad at all for all of the games youve made the team lose due to your terrible hero pick do you realize that mercy is one of the worst heros in the game right now she has less than a pickrate in pro games and its declining each season even in normal comp games her pickrate has gone down every season you may not know this but you are the problem with the game right now that smug mercy main feeling you resonate with that feeling of baby sitting the team that feeling of usefullness well its all fake you think you are helping the team at all with that gameplay literally the game aims for you you can heal people behind you zero aim or skill required it makes you feel like you are helping when in reality you are making the team lose be honest how much of each game do you spend waiting to respawn as mercy mercy is a target that dies over and over again not only that you sit on your rez waiting for that potg man rez only using it once a game due to that selfish cancer
Overwatch,removed,i have no reason to have an argument with a retard
Overwatch,removed,
Overwatch,removed,im pretty sure this how the holocaust started apathy and indifference for the cause in this case is just as bad as not protecting an actual mercy

Overwatch,removed,its not my money actually its someone elses money and yes they are being a dick about the refund policy took me half an hour or so to get above lvl that bullshit that i never agreed with btw since i wasnt the one who bought it and just because something was available for a certain time doesnt mean everyone took advantage of it again no indecisiveness and lack of foresight from me my foresight was that it would be a shit game and i wouldnt like it didnt take long for me to decide on that when i got my hands on the game casualshit game fuck off blizzfanboy

Overwatch,removed,youre a retard when youve just started playing you dont know the champions their counters the maps the health packs and the ultimates in that scenario someone that has had only hours of play is at a huge disadventage to someone that had thats basic god damn common sense and i argue that having to buy another game to be able to play said game with your friends is ridiculous
Overwatch,removed,my comment of you being a retard was about what you said about levels not your crappy solution which isnt one by the way considering the price of that game and again youre a retard if you think reading about overwatch will mean that a beginner player will be able to stand on his own against someone that has played for dozens and dozens of hours you learn the game by playing it go fuck yourself youre of no use at all
Overwatch,removed,dude fuck you and get a life

Overwatch,removed,im not saying there arent a lot of people who want the im saying i personally would have liked a option as well jesus christ maybe if you werent such a fucking dipshit you wouldnt feel the need to make these inane defensive responses about a company you like
Overwatch,removed,its not that you dont agree with me its that your response was completely worthless both times you started out by saying dont buy it if you dont want it which is obvious the point of my post was that a separate version for people who didnt want the extra content other than the skins would have been nice if having that included upped the price instead of considering any of that you went straight for being defensive and patronizing and told me to not buy it if i dont like it well no shit im just saying why i dont like it its just voicing a negative opinion and you dont like it so you act bitchy and now you accuse me of being immature which is like the main insult of year olds on the internet who dont like being sworn at when theyre called out
Overwatch,removed,well your idiocy annoys me so i guess were even dipshit
Overwatch,removed,actually no its why its more niche let me explain league is literally just a dumbeddown version of dota thereby making it easier for the average pubscum fuckwit you to get in to it and not get frustrated

Overwatch,removed,how many times to i have to repeat that thats exactly what i said in my post i said that the esports focus is on pc but there is still a competitive scene for consoles jesus you need to learn to read kid you seem to fail to comprehend what youve said clearly you believe there will be support for console overwatch esports just because something is competitive doesnt make it an esport every single game ever made has a competitive side that doesnt mean they were fucking esports this may be hard for you to understand as youve proven already but for something to be an esport it needs to have viewers the vast majority of viewers prefer to watch the version thats more balanced has better players and is more precise period end of story now heres the important part stay with me i know you can that doesnt mean pc is better or that console wont be competitive it does mean however that a flourishing scene will never develop for consoles

Overwatch,removed,plently of cases like flusha and olofmeister nope completely wrong flusha has the most fucking obvious scenes and even the most die hard csgo personalities richard lewisthorin have both said that its very likely that some csgo players are hacking surefour on stream did mouse cam literally doesnt matter you dont know what smoothingfov is she went on stage on a fresh computer with mousekeyboard cam and performed the same as she always did have you actually watched the video this is the complete opposite to what surefour is doing theres no fucking tracking at all her mouse moves all over the enemies body this is the complete opposite and has nothing to do with aimbotting youre apart of the community who seems to think theyre a expert and can tell what textbook aimbotting is when they have no idea what theyre talking about i have used pretty much every hack that existed at one point for css i even had a server sided hack so i think i kinda know what cheatingaimbots look like thank you its a lot easier to hack in csgo than it is with blizzards engine that they specifically built for overwatch completely wrong hack makers are scared of creating hacks because blizzard has a history of suing hackbot makers look at bossland vs blizzard keep up the shit posts literally surefour tracking besides the tracking through walls which any decent has disabled the hacks are just not from americaneuropean providers but from chineserussians this time

Overwatch,removed,or somehow the aimbot is within his mkb software or something that is ridiculous literally being done in csgo since quite a while its ridiculous that you dont know that and think you can still talk about hacking compare this to his lan play please really i want you to watch his lan vods and then look at this and tell me if you notice that its completely different
Overwatch,removed,youre going to lose all in a row you stupid sack of shit
Overwatch,removed,so youre dodging my offer good to know watch his youtube and be amazed about what cheat coders can actually do only reason why there arent any cheats by the most popularknown providers is the blizzard suing them part try to inform yourself little boy compare this to his lan play please tell me how its supposed to be similar it isnt no snapping and perfect body tracking in his lan games obvious aimbot and smoothing on the aimbot mate
Overwatch,removed,literally the one i had i was able to turn aimbots on for other players change the hitboxes of players turn wallbang onoff for certain players and anti flash dont remember more but there were more than this one this was popular because you used to play on your own servers in esl games my sides youre either trolling or ignorant

Overwatch,removed,mind fuckin off with ur shitty editting
Overwatch,removed,well that and the fact that you value being an obnoxious asshole over your own intelligence that gif just proves my point you fucking idiot

Overwatch,removed,this is so fucking gay
Overwatch,removed,dont wanna be that guy but diamond isnt that impressive
Overwatch,removed,playing lucio every game will get you to diamond or above even if you are just mediocre its a legit strat for climbing ranks
Overwatch,removed,he is dont delude yourself into thinking your a genius playing just czu you play lucio
Overwatch,removed,so whats he going to do v you
Overwatch,removed,if you can name someone thats easier i think he takes the spot of easiest hero
Overwatch,removed,isnt this post just me sayign that im shit but clearly so is everyone outside of masters so im extra shit feel free to dox me and kill me shit players like me should die
Overwatch,removed,i hope your house burns down and you never play the christmas patch
Overwatch,removed,i got carried to diamond last season playing him and the same this season but thats really low rank so what do i know
Overwatch,removed,its better then my low skill ass hogging the tank or dps and ruining the game for everyone else right at least with lucio it doesnt matter what i do cuz the only good playing are grandmaster and above
Overwatch,removed,then why not just call the ranks what they are stop playing maybe you will do well gold cuz we feel sorry for you titanium bronze masters people that actually matter and are good
Overwatch,removed,so rename the ranks to make sure they actually reflext the poeple in them dont call it gold when we all know everyone in thier is a piece of shit retard player
Overwatch,removed,your only in your clearly dont know shit dont blame your team if you cant win
Overwatch,removed,so youd all rather me play a shitty tank or dps then a hero that doesnt require me to be good even though you have all complain about shitty dps and tanks but when they play lucio they are shit and should stop playing
Overwatch,removed,you should just stop
Overwatch,removed,then make a better name for bronze like your really bad at this game and you might as well play minecraft like your told then we can move bronze up to just below masters to reflext the actual skill levels of players there the names arent really important but clearly silvergoldplatdiamond isnt accurate
Overwatch,removed,then that player belongs back in bronze
Overwatch,removed,you should
Overwatch,removed,if people refuse to let you play lucio thats fine you lose that game but you win more later it averages out fine and by the time your in masters the dps and tanks will carry you in solo q all you need to do is press e when they go in and press e when they get low
Overwatch,removed,let me quess your in diamond and think your good now diamond isnt that high and shouldnt be called diamond might as well just call bronze masters and make up stupid names for higher ranks
Overwatch,removed,angry i just dont like to have nonsensical names for things
Overwatch,removed,thats more accurate everoyne below masters and grandmasters is kinda shit
Overwatch,removed,i never gave you my rank im not even going to pretend to be in masters
Overwatch,removed,im not upset i just want shit to make any sense the rank names are boring and nonsense
Overwatch,removed,bronze
Overwatch,removed,lets be honest though we arent good everything below masters is just random
Overwatch,removed,if they just reversed the ranks and called bronze grandmasters and went down to bronze people would be like wtf that makes no sense
Overwatch,removed,its easy to get carried and its names are stupid
Overwatch,removed,so your opinion is only valid if you are grandmaster so you basically aggree with me that below masters is shit
Overwatch,removed,i just dont see how my rank has anything to do with the rank names they dont make any sence why is gold which is given to winners in sports given to one of the lowest ranks
Overwatch,removed,why it would be boring just me as lucio holding down e cuz thats all you need to do to get into diamond which isnt decent if i can get there
Overwatch,removed,best i wont you to point to me saying that im good please cuz if anything ive only said im shit
Overwatch,removed,how what words would you have said i dont see why people are upset that i called their rank shit even when it is and that includes mine
Overwatch,removed,ego i actively said that im shit that i cant even play lucio well and that i got carried how is that inflated what should i say give out my address and tell people to firebomb my flat since im so shit
Overwatch,removed,then why not just make the actuall mmr a secret and show people inflated mmrs like show a bronze player that thier mmr is higher
Overwatch,removed,why cuz i dont pretend that im some amazing genius player cuz i played lucio in diamond
Overwatch,removed,salty ig they called gold trans people and niggas are subhuman would we say that anyone that complains about its name is salty
Overwatch,removed,any game that lets me into diamond which people here seem to agree is good is inherently shit and clearly doesnt know how to place people in skill rankings
Overwatch,removed,wouldnt telling people they are in a low rank with its title encourage people to climb i dont see any reason to lie to people about how good they are just so they feel good
Overwatch,removed,shit still shit dont delude yourself your still shit almost there bronze masters grandmasters
Overwatch,removed,im only parroting opinions diamond is shit and im only their cuz lucio is a free carry
Overwatch,removed,if someone like me is in diamond its just lends crendence to the arguement that diamond players are shit
Overwatch,removed,clearly they shouldnt feel like that ranks mean nothing if i can get any higher than bronze just by abusing the easiest hero
Overwatch,removed,then cunts like me should die feel free to go kill me
Overwatch,removed,just look up whichever is the average rank pretty sure its diamond so put them in bronze
Overwatch,removed,anyone that you dont agree with isnt human ok clearly i should die
Overwatch,removed,im competitive playing anything other than lucio would count as griefing since i know i cant play anything well
Overwatch,removed,i have plenty of hours in other heros im just shit and its not like i havent played and learned all heros
Overwatch,removed,ill be banned if you ruin games you get banned and i agree blizzard should give out peoples addresses to griefers so someone can go kill them that includes me if ruin games by switching off lucio
Overwatch,removed,its not murder is its justified someone who cant play overwatch and ruins games should be killed
Overwatch,removed,just me and my 💕daddy💕 hanging out i got pretty hungry🍆 so i started to pout 😞 he asked if i was down ⬇for something yummy 😍🍆 and i asked what and he said hed give me his 💦cummies💦 yeah yeah💕💦 i drink them💦 i slurp them💦 i swallow them whole💦 😍 it makes 💘daddy💘 😊happy😊 so its my only goal 💕💦😫harder daddy harder daddy 😫💦💕 cummy💦 cummy💦💦 cummy💦💦💦 💦💦💦💦 im 💘daddys💘 👑princess 👑but im also a whore 💟 he makes me feel squishy💗he makes me feel good💜 💘💘💘he makes me feel everything a little should 💘💘💘 👑💦💘wawhat💘💦👑

Overwatch,removed,this is so sad these kind of comments will make developers not talk to the community have you seen how valve handles things nor have i because valve never talks to us just because of this reason blizzard have also started to respond way less on the official wow forums since back in vanilla because all you niggas do is bitch out like some kind of spoiled brat
Overwatch,removed,go fuck yourselves stop trying to choose what people can post fuck off

Overwatch,removed,i know youre asking because you dont like the rule not because you want to hear the answer but there you go can you just stop that crap dude i was asking a legitimate question and it certainly wasnt to hear your snark totally inappropriate and not cool
Overwatch,removed,or partnering with other subreddits for collaboration i would suggest promoting rcompetitiveoverwatch and treat it like how rgameofthrones and rasoiaf interact with eachother if you want indepth discussion about the game and strategies go to compow and for the rest stay on roverwatch

Overwatch,removed,not angry why do you have to be an ass who speaks as such because he cant believe something he hasnt experienced and then also decides that it cant be true because of such stupid logic as you can see i dont deal with people and their stupidity maybe if you didnt reveal yourself as such i wouldnt call a duck a duck see there is a way that if you type it shows you to be a stupid ass douche you type that way so i call you out on it now if you take foul language as a way of being angry instead of it just showing how little respect i have for you then again thats your faulty dumb logic

Overwatch,removed,youre asking for a small tweak to a character you said yourself is already viable nobody here is arguing what she does is lame or not but what she does does in fact work past silver so im not sure if thats your issue here or not and if you want to accuse me of not even reading what youre saying why dont you actually address why picking her is bad when all solutions to making her viable are for people to learn her and learn how to play with her you want people to not pick her then she wont be played and they wont buff her again after this tweak that you clearly have not tried at all because thats exactly what happened with ana nobody here is arguing youre just blatantly bickering

Overwatch,removed,maybe the reason they did it is so that autistic children like you wouldnt have an opinion on the changes thinking
Overwatch,removed,kill yourself 😂😂😂
Overwatch,removed,notice how your score is hidden its quite obvious why it is by the way the world does not revolve around me nor you and you are making yourself look like an idiot with no proper knowledge
Overwatch,removed,do you require the services of a hackercontact for your ethical and unethical hackshes time consciousvery discreet and reliablehes the best ive worked with so farcheck him out and you wont be disappointedserious enquiries only

Overwatch,removed,wew lad most autistic comment ive seen in a while cheating in a video game doesnt make you hitler lel
Overwatch,removed,what i find amusing is you dont need to be here but chose to be if youd like pleasant people you should probably go about responding to people in pleasant ways instead of calm down with your assumptions which cant be proven or disproved yet i find people like you so amusing i really cant stand people like you who live off ego and the belief that they know whats best for the world i dont understand if your so nice why you would try to censor a discussion from being had rather then denouncing and shit posting
Overwatch,removed,first off you cant and didnt prove shit or even try to prove shit you simply made a claim as i did second clearly you dont grasp the point like every other retard on reddit you dont get to tell someone to dig before they post you dont get to post someone and then expect nothing in response you dont get to have a dick measuring contest on who said what and which was worse if you dont like the way someone treated you evaluate how you treated that person instead of getting butthurt and claiming my comment was worse get the fuck over it dont initiate it if you cant handle it and learn to fucking contribute information without being a righteous prick who in fact did more flaming then listing information
Overwatch,removed,hahahahaha thanks for the show freak i think it funniest that youre still comparing x is worse then y when you initiated the exchange and still continue to reply clearly you were bothered enough to continue the exchange and attempt to have the last word you were also bothered enough to form an opinion about a strangers life who youve encountered on reddit for no more then messages i use statements like that when someone displays their intelligence and contribution level to me which you clearly did
Overwatch,removed,i love being continually proven right by other peoples own stupidity
Overwatch,removed,its not random you spam h before the game starts
Overwatch,removed,fag
Overwatch,removed,well youre a waste of a cumshot so theres that
Overwatch,removed,im saying youre wrong citing ignorance as the reason and still you continue to act like you know what youre talking about like all the other morons
Overwatch,removed,no duplicate system only helps the consumer and its at the expense of the seller so not happening ever coin system makes up for it like you said the consumers here are morons circlejerking dumb ideas to public view they wont go elsewhere they dont have the brain or spine for that im sorry i triggered you by pointing out the flaws in the ideas please find a safespace and some breast milk to calm you down
Overwatch,removed,no there were no misleading promises youre just a fucking moron for thinking the way you think

Overwatch,removed,you cant legit make anyone believe that youre years old youre acting like a fucking prick yo that gets smacked in class every fucking day but maybe you were one of those and retained your horribly fucked up personality throughout your worklife and are since then stuck in a job with severe depression who knows for a matter of fact youre a pretty damn useless human being as it appears here work on your attitude and get some fresh air maybe people will start to like you then instead of being divorced and dwelling in a basement since probably years im out of this ridiculous timewaste of a conversation now have a good day
Overwatch,removed,backfill in comp are you retarded

Overwatch,removed,how do we know the tp is easily hacked maybe it isnt which is the reason she cant hack it there is no reason to ask this question its an absurd question how do we even know there is gravety in the overwatch universe oh becuse you can assume there is as you should assumehacking a computer in a game where you put a hacker into it would be more efficent than standing there and just shooting it while hacking it literally does nothing at all that would make the tp useless it wouldnt make it any less useless than if any other character destroyed it me saying she should be able to hack a tp doesnt mean i am saying she should be able to shut down all tps by simply spawning come on man gimi a break i would rate the movie as legit why spend time hacking everything when you can destroy it with a gun very funny yes it could be a funny scene but if literally everytime the hacker walked up toa computer he said i cant do anything with this and he shot it instead it wouldnt be a movie about a hacker are you mentally fucking retarded she is able to hack those personal computer machines you write about not the tp what you want is fucking retarded if sombra could keep hacking when taking damage would be so fucking stupid think of it this way she focuses on hacking and will hack if she is not interrupted you are full hate and bring adhominem to a discussion about a video game here is some back at you you are a piece of scum shit and shouldnt be posting you also lack a creative mind and are a fanboy cuck blizzard designed a really good character that smart people with an iq above will understand easily you got that i called you a fucking retared xd right thats my point you are an idiot she isnt used in comp over all youtube agrees that she sucks and you come in here thinking you should ad hominem to defend your arguments does an invisibility cloak exist no is sombra good the way she is played yes whenever she is not played by you more lack of ability to use your own brain sombra can kill people with her smg though this is something you dont want to do with sombra as she isnt a genji or tracer shut the fuck up what dose this have to do with anything at all nthing but i see you bring your weebu senpai genji into the fucking conversation as usual you faggot it isnt blizzards fault youre too dumb to realize stuff mate oh god mate more fucking idiot brexit brits go fucking back to work at the cannery or in london which has the worst polution in the western world the hacking of a turret is clearly and obviously showing how blizzard is balancing the game making her hack a turret the same amount of time as it takes to destroy it with an smg is just more elegent than using an smg as a hacker and supports her lore and character design but you are too stupid to understand that because you dont know how to play her she isnt supposed to hack shit while taking damage you fucking moron you dont know how to read made it all clear yes yes that you are a fucking retard

Overwatch,removed,kill yourself
Overwatch,removed,gave him my address in chat hes too much of a coward to follow through on his threats remind me why gamers arent fucking pathetic
Overwatch,removed,this dumb ass is stacking and just feeding but getting points
Overwatch,removed,you realize there is a point variance in ranking right and hacking is more prevalent in these lower tiers most likely because low level tier players havent figured out what it actually looks like yet it becomes pretty apparent in the higher tiers when someone is cheating or not because they know how to look for mechanic versus organic snap and cheaters dont tend to last longer in these upper divisions it not only makes sense its painfully obvious also how many accounts have you got yourself banned now and why are you still posting from a sock puppet inc denial and subsequent ban
Overwatch,removed,oh go fuck yourself whytro you and the other liberal nazis on this website just add to the utter shit that makes reddit so completely garbage im going to bet you fucking cried when hillary lost rather than let a lil free speech and thought take place youd rather gag people not unlike the ball gag your gf places in your mouth as youre forced to watch her get stretched by a giant black bull like the dirty little cuckstar you are
Overwatch,removed,the only thing confirmed is that itll use the newest nvidia tegra i never said its confirmed the tegra is the newest tegra so you exactly said it is confirmed even undervolted it would still beat and xbo this is blatantly false you do not even know the full specs but the specs we do know are barely above the original and xbone if it is undervolted or insufficiently cooled it is going to get destroyed please just stick your argument up your ass learn how computers work faggot

Overwatch,removed,you can feel free to fuck right off maybe the reason that you havent found a community is because youre an asshole and nobody wants you around have you tried a trump rally
Overwatch,removed,who gives a fuck if youre a mother stfu
Overwatch,removed,that insults literally makes no sense youre wrong and you cant admit that youre in the wrong youre stubborn ignorant and apathetic youre not even worth my time youre a waste of space
Overwatch,removed,are you a fucking idiot
Overwatch,removed,fat people make cons less fun for everybody else just by showing up
Overwatch,removed,oh shut the fuck up seriously i am so tired of shit from people like you you dont even realize how pathetic you are you cling to these stupid internet stereotypes i dont act the same way towards every person youve pissed me off so i am annoyed is that so hard to understand also im a grown adult but when people are wrong the first thing that should happen is that they should be told and only children refuse to acknowledge when theyre wrong and considering that you refuse to accept that youre wrong you are the only immature little brat here mmk fuck off back to nursery boy
Overwatch,removed,how to rectangle as nazi roboguy
Overwatch,removed,because some people want big tits are you a fucking brat
Overwatch,removed,i know their fake i meant theyre an idiot for being a douche
Overwatch,removed,having suicidal thoughts or being depressed is nothing special grow a pair and get over what someone you dont know said in a video game or stop playing i know the game is rated t but that applies only to the bot matches
Overwatch,removed,i mean fat black people would just need a white shirt to cosplay as winston who by the way has also lost his dead
Overwatch,removed,kill yourself
Overwatch,removed,well i work from home when im not working im taking a brake and browsing reddit i refuse to let little kids whore blind and stupid think theyre in the right ill tell even a year old such as yourself when youre wrong youre stupid and obnoxious i wonder how your mother feels about your petty behaviour online also wonder what your teachers at school would say probably that you need to learn to read better
Overwatch,removed,lmao his aimbot is actually going ham
Overwatch,removed,i agree entirely
Overwatch,removed,hes is cheating in this clip if you choose not to believe it that your choice just doesnt change the fact
Overwatch,removed,its so blatent
Overwatch,removed,how retarded can you possibly be theres no reason to provide proof when you can just try it yourself
Overwatch,removed,i am ready for the hate i might will receive from writing this comment i always tell people to kill themselves its just a thing i say i dont think of it as an issue but others have and tell me dont tell people to kill themselves what if they actually do it and to that my reply is always the same if some random person on the internet tells you to kill yourself and you do it then youre stupid and there probably wasnt much of a future for you anyway
Overwatch,removed,what a retard
Overwatch,removed,stupid nigger
Overwatch,removed,whats so hard about realizing people are bigger bricks when under the guise of anonymity whats so hard about realizing people acting like pricks can easily be shrugged off you want to act like zoeing is the asshole here but in my mind youre the douchebag acting high and mighty over a stranger who you disagree with my this sounds familiar almost like its the exact same scenario op is describing except youre being the fucktard grow up and move on
Overwatch,removed,well taimou was well known silent cheater in dirty bomb it was still pretty obvious and he got banned by devs thanks god he is probbaly doing exact same thing here in overwatch he is indeed trying to be sneaky and not obious at all but holly shit there is many videos of taimou blatantly cheating in overwatch even when he was streaming this lowlife creature cant even hide it just watch his vods he is constantly pressing aim key to know from which side enemies are coming thats pretty funny and obvious at the same time and all those crazy flicks are just done by cheats blizzard is probably as pathetic as valve and know that cheating on lan tournamnets is happening but of course they wont do shit cause it will damage pseudo competetive scene no competetive scene no money i am sure that valve is actually hiding a lot evidence but as soon as they decide to publish it as fast it will be the end of csgo scene
Overwatch,removed,because as someone who also deals with depression you need to stop being a little bitch
Overwatch,removed,this comment gave me cancer
Overwatch,removed,most people have suicidal thoughts and depression at some point youre not special just grow up mate
Overwatch,removed,its no secret that overwatch has a very diverse cast of characters but lucio in particular really shocked me im a black myself and although i am not quite as popular as reinhardt my dj career was just forged with kfc i really appreciate the attention lucio was given as a front line support for his payload its really stupid i know but the fact that i actually play the team payload dancer pushing payloads having my team walk up to me and ask for healing turning up the volume and being amazing its just really good design you really did make lucio mechanically a black for his whole team so again thanks you did a really great job with him
Overwatch,removed,if someone kills themselves because a random stranger on the internet is mean to them its a wonder they werent dead already
Overwatch,removed,found the angry kid who feels the need to hate things for no reason
Overwatch,removed,lets play spot the kid oh theres one cptcampi seems to be around
Overwatch,removed,maybe you wouldnt play with people like that if u werent rank shitter
Overwatch,removed,and i wish i would run into people like him in real life
Overwatch,removed,right so youre clearly delusional living in a fantasy world where everything is jokes and fun and smiles and rainbows ahahaha l o l lemao those isis dudes just blow some people to bits what a neat joke ahahaha

Overwatch,removed,i found that last part rather confusing httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvlqoizhfhea get in front of the rein shield get in front of it
Overwatch,removed,im diamond and it still doesnt change the fact zarya can barrier allies to save them from hook combos and pins you also forget that if you are shooting anywhere near here general direction and she can just walk forward and eat damage before you have any time to react she also only needs charge to start hurting like a bitch maybe instead of being an insulting fucktard youd think about the retarded shit spewed out of your mouth

Overwatch,removed,watch me whip is literally the worst song i have ever heard the song watch me whip is singlehandedly the worst song i have ever heard before you get all bent out of shape i do know that its not to be some intellectual masterpiece of modern art it is just factually a shitty song heres why repetition this song takes repetition to a level rivaled only by songs written for yearolds the singer repeats his name a full times before the third verse just in case you were wondering who wrote no vocalised the script put in front of him there were words in this song is nae a word scratch that i truly dont care of those words three variations now watch now watch me watch me represent words thats more than ⅓ of the song for literally words and i didnt include the single mentions of the word me if we include ooh there are instances and bop there are instances which total we have out of words made up of words i think we get the picture on this simplicity the most complex word in this song is a tie between silento the vocalists not an artist in my opinion handle the word already which appears literally once and the word superman doing a quick tally that means that single word instances are syllables all the rest are or syllables the vocabulary is not strong with this one look at that my use of vocabulary beat out this song by whole syllables the culmination of the two previous points into the dumbing down of everyone who had the displeasure of hearing this song pretty selfexplanatory look i get that the writer wasnt going for a pulitzer or a grammy but a quick hit thatll be catchy and easy to remember fair enough except fuck you youre literally ruining music who am i to say what should and shouldnt be written an asshole thats who one who is procrastinating other important work basically by putting music out that has a grand total of about unique words youre contributing to the lowered standard of quality of music this is one step away from repeating one single word over and over for minutes straight which now that i think about it probably exists except that would have some comedic value at the very least this shit well its like a kindergartener took a crayon and drew a stickman poorly i might add that was subsequently put up in an art gallery real impressionable children will listen to this and think wow dad was wrong i can skate in life only knowing less than the bare minimum needed to be able to read see spot run which i never did because fuck books and education side note that interaction wouldnt have been possible outside the childs head since there are too many unique words used now put on your tinfoil hats because this is where i lose half of you with my bullshit songs like this promote the opposite of education like i said it devalues a halfway competent vocabulary in the name of catchiness and a cheap musical fix when you see what can be presumably defined as success ie having several hundred million views on youtube and countless other radio plays it sets a standard in young impressionable minds weve had many people trying to get past this dumbing down of society like krsone stevie wonder john lennon and many others no of course not all of their songs they were trying to create a more engaged people who reflect on the actual issues we face as a society instead of making up a cute little dance to go along with your shitty track as your brain melts from lack of use who is the target market for this song for all the reasons ive brought forth i believe the target market to be the typical vapid vacuous consumer that doesnt engage in critical thought related to anything more than whether the kardashians look better in blue or teal i realise that ive made a broad fairly baseless claim and yet im confident its pretty accurate songs like these placate the masses with their simplicity and safety you dont need to think you dont need to guess what its talking about you just need to follow these three easy steps and you too can conform to the newest dance craze independent thought is the antithesis of this track by listening to this you are using time that could be spent thinking of ways to better the citycountryworld you live in again i realise that not everyone wants to engage with the world like this but i will still stand by the claim that critical thought is better than being herded like a goddamn sheep by popmusic so what have we learned today well mostly that im way too mad about a song thats a given what i want to really stress is that this song is symptomatic of a larger issue at hand like the cia funneling crack into ghettos to me this type of music represents a concerted effort to quell independent thought ultimately its easier to listen to a catchy song with like words than to actually sit back and think about why everything is kind of messed up i really truly fucking despise this song

Overwatch,removed,
Overwatch,removed,the url at the bottom seems to be which seems to be an official blizzard employee site
Overwatch,removed,jive software is some sort of employee network provider httpsblizzardhostedjivesoftwarecom so one of three things is true someone had a lot of spare time and money and set up a fake blizzard employee network this is a real blizzard employee network but the hover url seen in the image was faked because they knew we couldnt actually access the site this is an actual leak from a blizzard employee
Overwatch,removed,here buddy a few people posted it too
Overwatch,removed,for those asking there is no link to this article the url just leads to httpsblizzardhostedjivesoftwarecom which seems to be some blizzard employee network

Overwatch,removed,i smoke more weed then u and fucked your dads
Overwatch,removed,your mother and i did the naughty
Overwatch,removed,you should add more pictures in the story like this y
Overwatch,removed,did someone say horse
Overwatch,removed,the machines on hanamura you can jump into can actually be done randomly i jumped in there on my first day and got the lagging when u jump but i didnt know it could crash a server so when the round started i just jumped out
Overwatch,removed,i was confused too turn out theres this that will cause the server to crash if you do it if you do it too many times then you get banned
Overwatch,removed,for a moment i thought it said they would ban indefinitely for genjihanzo and i got excited then i realized they attached conditions to it if you play genji get fucked stop
Overwatch,removed,wtf i am just trying to be nice punani
Overwatch,removed,your mother is gonna enjoy me even more
Overwatch,removed,they didnt ban him that isnt the op you smug prick
Overwatch,removed,as hanzo or genji break open one of the hanamura claw machines shown in the attached screenshot jump into themmay need to crouch and jump and face the adjacent machine hold wor whatever your forward movement is bound to and mash the jump button as fast as you can all players on the server will experience terrible lag and if you do this enough the message the server closed due to an unexpected error will appear the map will then restart with the same teams some friends and i have been able to replicate the bug in custom games the implications of this bug are pretty huge attackers can reset the match on a whim if they are losing somebody can indefinitely reset the match and essentially hold players hostage as the match will never end and progress to a new map

Overwatch,removed,fuck the community punish the player for developers incompetence good job fanboys lick that blizzard cum all right up
Overwatch,removed,i tried googling
Overwatch,removed,wow you could actually do this by accident
Overwatch,removed,holy fuck the last five posts in this thread have been the same thing im just going to say what it is and hopefully everyone will see that it is actually really hard to do by accident and you wont ever do it unless youre trying to do it everyone going its a secret google it and touching their nose isnt doing anything to keep the glitch from being hidden and if anyone reads this post and goes into the game to try it i hope your dumbass enjoys the ban it involves crouching under an area that you would not normally go like the bottom of a stair in nepal you go under the ramp of the landing shipspawn point in volskaya you go into a corner of a nook in spawn etc you spam your jump button for like ten seconds server starts to lag and then crashes
Overwatch,removed,this is odd the videos just show genji trying to clip through a wall for a few seconds in any location that matches a certain profile even right off the start zone i dont play either hero but it looks really easy to do accidentally more interestingly i cant fathom why that causes a crash
Overwatch,removed,i dont understand why people are avoiding saying how its done when its already shown that anyone that does it will get perm banned its not like everyone is going to run off and do it basically you get in a small space like the ramp leading out of the spawn ship and jump so it climbs over and over but the model doesnt have room to move and it overloads not easy to do accidentally but definitely not as impossible as people make it out to be now you know and you wont do it
Overwatch,removed,just dont wall run on any entities make sure its a wall and not a game object that can be interacted with including the moving robot found on hanamura and similar objects on other maps you really dont find yourself running on these on accident so there isnt much to worry about this is probably overly cautious but its good to follow it anyways i wonder how blizzard determines who crashed the server look for a recurring player in every server then just ban that person would be interesting to crash games as a party of and see how they react they could single out a party but thats it who in the party was guilty and whether or not the others knew about it would be a mystery of course i wouldnt do that but an interesting experiment nonetheless
Overwatch,removed,wall climb below the door that opens at the start of the game now you know
Overwatch,removed,wait how do you crash the server with them
Overwatch,removed,the only one i can see seriously happening by accident is on hanamura for hanamura stay out of the machines
Overwatch,removed,got what you deserved scum
Overwatch,removed,in glad you got perma banned piece of shit doing it on purpose to avoid a loss makes you a dick
Overwatch,removed,telling people how to do it and actually doing it arent the problem banning people for doing it and banning people for talking about it are the problem censorship is censorship
Overwatch,removed,were teh lulz it worth it you piece of garbage
Overwatch,removed,get fukt
Overwatch,removed,its good that theyre consistently removing the retarded fucks from the game

Overwatch,removed,lold fuck himthis kid
Overwatch,removed,i like how you crave my attention what points that you shouldnt have to maintain something akin to resilience to play a video game youre close to right but the fact is this is a game that involves the internet and thus all bets are off youd have an easier time trying to nail shit to the wall than you would controlling the intercunt or perhaps that as you say the tos is against harassment and yet its not enforced how about this why dont you outline some kind of universally accepted scale or metric for what is and isnt offense and then i shall honestly consider that a point except you cant do that because there is no universally accepted scale for what is and isnt offensive so how exactly should the tos be enforced perhaps in the same way that enforcement and censorship happens on twitter ya know that scheme that thousands are up in arms about and abandoning the platform causing twitter to taaaaaaaaank because it massively favours one side of the spectrum while fucking the other up the arse your problem is that you only see the pros of the world under your delusional ideology you fail to see the flaws because you believe there are none satisfied sweetheart
Overwatch,removed,you are actually autistic
Overwatch,removed,faggot
Overwatch,removed,actually i would use that word of course i am dutch and the dutch are known for crude jokes didnt know that did you faggot
Overwatch,removed,is superior to this garbage
Overwatch,removed,not wasting my time reading that rubbish im the guy who plays the nonmeta hero choices and cant stand ranked because of the strict dynamic who wants to play a gametype where you have to have a reinhardt to win and who wants to play a gametype where no one tries because its just quickplay bro so yea if youve used that line please kys
Overwatch,removed,thats what i said only soldier can take out phara and that is because he is broken too
Overwatch,removed,
Overwatch,removed,i think you need to kill yourself for being such a pussy and if you really considered offing yourself based on the words of some stranger on the internet when playing a game you are one of the most emotionally liable people i have met and shouldnt be on the internet in general cause you are going to have a hard time when playing overwatch i have played with people who ignored or plainly refused any suggestion to switch their character then its just minutes of brainless idiots trying the same shit over and over and over again no regrouping no selecting a counter to the enemy no teamwork nothingits just all this im doing my best dont yell at me pussy attitude that cant even take the slightest criticism if you are playing a widow for full minutes without switching and the enemy has a winstongenji combo and you are dying every single time maybe you do kind of deserve to be told to kill yourself given that these people i tell this to are mostly trolls completely ignoring you i couldnt care less about their feelings
Overwatch,removed,lmao if someone talking shit over the internet gets you sad you should honestly kill yourself in real life youre worthless and a burden to society

Overwatch,removed,rcompetitiveoverwatch is probably the place youd want to hang out they discuss these topics and more with that being said enjoy the game for what it is right now i just switched from csgo a week back and im finding the game to be really relaxing but fun at the same time basicly the game is what you make it out to be right now just hope ranked doesnt create the same toxicity that it has with other competetive games
Overwatch,removed,a prime example of why a lfg chat is necessary happened like three minutes ago nobody needs to deal with these scum when theyre just looking for some people to play with

Overwatch,removed,this question comes up a ton on rcompetitiveoverwatch as people are saying bans might have a place but while the devs are open to single hero picks theyve stated that is a break glass in case of emergency scenario the skill cap on this game is that much higher due to hero switching in certain situations really makes counter picking a ton of fun and hopeless situations have a light at the end of the tunnel i cant count how many times ive seen a problem and then pressed h to find an answer and we won its a great feeling personally i hope switching is here to stay

Overwatch,removed,and what if a whole bunch of straight individuals absolutely adore the character that is announced as gay according to your line of thinking that would make them like himher less on top of that there are undoubtedly more straight individuals who like each member of the overwatch cast so is it not selfish of you to want this for the much smaller lgbt community that likes that singular specific character that is lgbt
Overwatch,removed,but you would like them more the default assumption for each character is heterosexual whether you or i like it or not unfortunately by taking that away your taking away the similarity between the two characters so in other words youre saying that your stance on liking a character more because theyre like you only applies to you which is idiotic and yeah you are selfish and no youre not a bitch youre a prick a fucking idiotic one at that
Overwatch,removed,q whats the diffrence between winston and miro one is a monkey that can talk the other has a tesla cannon

Overwatch,removed,stop being autistic sombra is definitely op in the current meta she has an aoe silence that also removes shields so zarya and zen get fucked by it combine that with an smg that seems to have a damage output that is higher than tracers pistols and has more range shes basically ana she will completely break the meta and will probably go months without a significant nerf because retards defend overdesigned characters because youre supposed to feel powerful
Overwatch,removed,hey man fuck you
Overwatch,removed,can you at least accept how you sound like a faggot boo hoo someones ruining my game by picking widow even though im a fucking scrub and dont have a fucking clue how to play anyway
Overwatch,removed,i only lose when i encounter blatant aimbotters not my video and this is on asia servers
Overwatch,removed,ok so what you say is that making tick enabled at competetive mode will under no circumstance affact anyone right you really like these strawman arguments let me make it very clear i never said that you fucking moron tick is not going to solve most of the problems with getting hit around corners that is almost all due to latency is that your statement and why you argue they should not increase the tickrate or im i misunderstanding your saying you are not only misunderstanding you are deliberately arguing a strawman because you are a fucking moron i never said they should not do it it is objectively better morons like you act like it will solve all of the worlds problem it will make very little difference but it is still worth doing im not talking about latency thats something you brought up and yes it has a greater affect but you make ur arguments based on something that is irrelevant for what i wrote this thread discuession for it is not irrelevant it is closely tied to what we are talking about you are a fucking moron like comeon lets keep this discuession tickrate based not latency if we go by your logic lets talk fpshz shall we yes let us talk about fps and hz because if you are not getting enough fps or your monitor cannot show enough hz you will notice even less difference again these concepts are closely related and you are a fucking moron
Overwatch,removed,nah thats not how it works you play comp to win if you refuse to swap or pick a stupid hero in the first place hanzojunkratwidow then you are the dick who doesnt give a shit anyways about the game while your teammates want to win you cant blame them for getting serious and a bit toxic if you just act like the retard you are people like you are the worst piece of shit in games like this you do everything wrong and try so hard to lose but then youre the good guy becuase you didnt cus at anyone great fucking job dickhead take your it jus a game mentality to quickplay and dont try to force it on players who may want to play a serious round and yes that involves telling your retarded ass boosted teammate to swap because he himself doesnt understand that hes pulling the team down

Overwatch,removed,yeah but its actually not reinhardt doesnt have an ability that lets him get behind the entire enemy team for free reinhardts ult doesnt last seconds reinhardts ult doesnt dispel shields making lucios ultimate completely worthless reinhardts ult has clear cut counters and drawbacks sombras ult not only goes through shields and barriers but straight up destroys them i dont have a problem with sombras ultimate but going hurr durr reainhart can stun peopel how is different is fucking autistic blabber instead of an excellent breakdown not to mention the ult isnt what most people have a problem with people are mad because sombra has midrange dps which rivals mccree has an escape which is as goodbetter than recall and has an ability that lets her get behind the entire enemy team for free and she has a silence ability and she has an aoe silence ult that also destroys all forms of shielding youd have to be actually retarded to not think sombras unbalanced in the way the game currently is after seeing like minutes of gameplay of her

Overwatch,removed,nah there are countless real arguments against op see the hundreds of other posts in this thread being a gamergater in isnt disqualifying it just provides further insight into the perspective of the op its like if youre posting im black people arent harassing you because youre black they harass everybody and then your post history is full of basically the exact same comment that you posted on white genocide forums
Overwatch,removed,i will when clueless people stop saying dumb shit
Overwatch,removed,amazing how youve not accidentally killed yourself yet by tripping down stairs or jaywalking against red lights for example suppose never leaving ones apartment has some benefits eh that mistake fixes itself at some point darwinism for the win

Overwatch,removed,maga
Overwatch,removed,q pelican following up with sombra during the panel you guys discussed that shed actually been around for a very long time can you maybe just go into detail about her history as a character and how it all came together a geoff goodman sure so she originally started as just that concept piece that art showed on the panel where she was cloaked and all those daggers they do that sometimes theyll just concept characters that dont exist yet like this would be cool and sometimes were just like uhh thats kind of interesting sometimes its like oh my god thats really cool we should definitely make something out of that that sombra was one we saw and we were like yeah we should definitely put some design into and get a prototype out so i had like a kind of rough paper design of what she could be at the time we didnt really have anybody like genji who eventually became genji to be this really really fast character tracer was the closest thing to it but you know something that was less about teleporting and something that was more about obviously youve seen genji you know what hes like – the fast speed you know dashing around and stuff so she had double jump and throwing daggers really really fast and stuff and she had this sonar dartdagger she would throw well once we got to hanzo we were like thatd be perfect if we thought of him we were looking at paper design and picking her part and it really was interesting at how intertwined she became in the design history of genji specifically because not only did she sort of get his kit basically cause basically the idea of a fast jump double jumping knife throwing guy but she sort of ended up getting what his kit was at the time the reason he transferred or needed a new kit was because we were working on stealth for him so genji started as almost a wow rogue in that he had the sword he ran around with all the time he didnt have a throwing weapon and he would stealth up and he had this specific move that drove people crazy he would go up behind somebody and he would like trip them and knock them over and they would be on the ground and he would do this slow sword thing that was gonna kill them and it took like a couple of seconds and if nobody hit me or damaged me or anything i would just kill them it didnt matter how much health they had it was just an instakill it was kind of neat because its almost like the left for dead hunter if your team is around it doesnt work it doesnt do anything but if you catch someone alone you can get the kill if you get the backstab off so from playing him it was actually kind of fun in its own way but playing against him it was just like what the hell youre just walking around im stunned i hate being stunned then im dead i hate being dead like so that was just terrible and then we were trying to iterate on it and then we were just like maybe this is just not what we should do cause part of the problem with him was the meleecentric things like what else could he do that could maybe get some range and then pull out the swords in a cool ult or something like that so thats where all the knife stuff came from we did want to go back to stealth at some point so we were like well lets try to revisit stealth from the ground up and you know lessons learned from trying to do the early genji prototypes so by the time we were working on ana we got like halfway through her we started up a new hero and we were like lets do stealth again lessons learned what do we know now so we sort of locked onto this idea of hacker cause it kind of fits really well with the stealth thing plus it gives us all this opportunity to do other things that werent just murdering somebody really hard cause you know thats the frustrating thing just the instakill so we got the hack thing done pretty early as a kind of a prototype thing so that was obviously key to the whole thing where she would get behind people although honestly even that had a lot of iteration early originally she was actually a support role and she used to do a lot less damage and she would stealth around and hack people – and hacking back then was a really long duration debuff that would lower their damage output and you could put it on multiple targets so you would stealth around and debuff everybody and just try to be evasive it was pretty interesting as a support role cause it was like a way that youre helping your team by weakening the other team but youre not really killing anybody – that was our extreme reaction to like okay she wont kill anybody now she can have stealth but shes not allowed to kill anybody that had a lot of problems too it was really frustrating to be like i guess im debuffed now i just suck for a while and cant find her cause shes stealthed cause originally her stealth was passive too so as long as you werent doing anything you would restealth that was an extreme version we iterated slowly and we were like okay so she cant have like no damage we can find a happy medium somewhere in the middle of these two so thats why shes in the assault role she is in now q spriteguy yeah i played a little bit of her on the floor and her damage is somewhere in the medium range of you can be really good at it but if youre standing all the way over there its not exactly fantastic its a pretty interesting play – i really liked it and i dont like that kind of flanky gotta go kill the healer person but i thought it was a really interesting playstyle q turik i thought you only play torbjorn q spriteguy no no that was season one ive grown in season two
Overwatch,removed,i dont care lol i use reddit rarely and i came here to help you but u are lazy and stupid so who gives a fuck good luck with ur issue dumbass
Overwatch,removed,q spriteguy i just wanted to ask its kind of a rhetorical question cause i think i already know the answer seeing that you guys have revisited stealth and revisited you know how pharah used to have massive barrier damage back in the day you kind of gave that to sombra in a way you guys never obviously throw anything away in terms of an idea can you just talk a little bit about your philosophy on that cause i thought it was really interesting that you gave the stealth to sombra when a long time ago you took it away from somebody else a geoff goodman the pharah one was interesting that ability in particular got pretty overloaded cause it was like i can knock people away from me or i can knock myself back or i can blow up barriers like how do i use this what do i do with this its not very clear what it was trying to be and it got to a point where it was really powerful and was like oh they have a reinhardt i have to be pharah and it got to a point where it was like we have to make a call were either going to proliferate this concept to more things that can specifically do barrier damage or we just remove it from pharah and you know see if barriers are actually a problem and maybe come back to it another time we decided that at that point to pull it off and come back and see if it was a problem – its still not like a massive problem behind barriers but i think we saw an opportunity with sombra to fill in a little bit of a niche there but in general youre right we dont throw anything away in both ideas and assets i think i actually have a ton of old prototypes sitting around and i think the data guys are super diligent about making sure its not datamined and they pull everything out they have some complicated system to handle it and im just like i hope you guys got it theyre good at their job thank god
Overwatch,removed,q turik do you ever see the ptr being used for more experimental content releases would you ever put something on the ptr that youre not even sure would even make it to live or are you guys only going to use it for polish a geoff goodman well i dunno thats a good point i guess like wheres the line cause we are putting stuff up what i figure are a bunch of crazy number tweaks again its working out pretty well so maybe thats better than i thought but i dont know if wed ever put something in but maybe the line is like super early prototype art stuff thats like confusing cause we have to play the game and i just pillage other peoples assets so ill just use like a skin from another character so that way its not as confusing when youre playing the other character so at least youd know but like people have that skin and it can get really confusing so its hard because its sort of our jobs to be able to put on a filter that can see through all that and look forward to what its trying to be and its harder for an average player to have that but maybe i think well see how this ptr goes and then maybe we can push it a little further in the spectrum of development
Overwatch,removed,q turik do you ever see the ptr being used for more experimental content releases would you ever put something on the ptr that youre not even sure would even make it to live or are you guys only going to use it for polish a geoff goodman well i dunno thats a good point i guess like wheres the line cause we are putting stuff up what i figure are a bunch of crazy number tweaks again its working out pretty well so maybe thats better than i thought but i dont know if wed ever put something in but maybe the line is like super early prototype art stuff thats like confusing cause we have to play the game and i just pillage other peoples assets so ill just use like a skin from another character so that way its not as confusing when youre playing the other character so at least youd know but like people have that skin and it can get really confusing so its hard because its sort of our jobs to be able to put on a filter that can see through all that and look forward to what its trying to be and its harder for an average player to have that but maybe i think well see how this ptr goes and then maybe we can push it a little further in the spectrum of development
Overwatch,removed,q pelican we had some people asking about the difference in the process of designing for console versus the pc because you guys have been pretty aggressive as far as getting patches out for console so just kind of from your point of view what has been the way that youve looked at it – the way you tweak balance between console and pc a geoff goodman yeah its challenging cause by and large im not trying to separate them too far i would like things to be pretty close in fact i think the only difference still between the two are the turrets are weaker both turrets symmetras and torbjorns – that came up a little bit early we didnt have a lot of stats at the time to sort of prove that that was a problem cause its hard to say especially when youre dealing with other players as targets people say like oh aiming as widowmaker is really hard but its like also people shooting at you is harder – its kind of two way streets and harder to judge but with turrets theyre just ai they just shoot you they dont care theyre not using a controller so that was like yeah i can kind of see that and we started to get stats back and yeah they are pretty significantly ahead probably difference or in some cases higher where they are relative to the heroes between the pc and the console regardless of how powerful they are generally because symmetra and torbjorn are both not super powerful in the current metagame that people are playing id like them to at least be relatively similar in their respective lineups so that was sort of where that came from and i think thats the most important thing – i occasionally see posts about symmetras turret nerf and shes weak now you have to kind of understand that symmetra is not super strong on the pc either this isnt a console problem she just needs help in general q turik yeah i think she had the highest winrate or during beta a geoff goodman yeah she did q turik its not always about feel sometimes its about actual numbers a geoff goodman yeah thats why were sort of working on symmetra now cause shes kind of beyond the point of just needing numbers tweaks in fact shes at a point where we couldnt really numbers tweak her cause what players felt they needed was for her just to be better but our stats and everything are showing that we cant do that cause its going to get really out of control so we need to sort of fix the character and make her feel like she has an impact and make bigger plays dont have anything concrete yet but shes taking a little longer than we had hoped unfortunately i was hoping when i was first looking at her and didnt know what i was going to do yet oh maybe thisll be like a dva thing where i swap her defense matrix to an alternate fire with a new meter that was probably like the biggest change that we had made to a character at that time but symmetras a lot bigger than that so its taking a bit longer
Overwatch,removed,q turik i was looking at the reaction to diablo that theyre releasing a new class and its interesting to me that there are some people that see new content only as new areas new gametypes and new things whereas some people see content as a new way to go through the familiar and it sounds like an overwatch – theres that angle a geoff goodman thats what so nice about the arcade were working on though like we get to play with these new gamemodes and stuff and people want like what would dueling be like so now were able to try it and throw it in the arcade and its not like in the normal sort of matchmaking setting it doesnt feel as serious you just have this kind of side thing to play with and in a way we get to sort of throw stuff in there as betas i mean theyll be polished and nice but we can see how people like it and obviously were gauging popularity internally and were actually showing people how popular they are too so you know if people start subreddits about dueling or something like that so maybe well see how popular things get and we can take it from there
Overwatch,removed,q turik what kind of timeframe are we looking at for new hero releases a geoff goodman were trying to produce a lot of different kinds of content like you see the junkrat event was really different and completely different – that takes a lot of artists to make that kind of content if we just dropped everything and just started work on heroes wed probably produce them a lot faster but i think a lot of people have different interests – some people want more events some people want more maps some people want more heroes so were just kind of trying to spread out the attention as much as possible
Overwatch,removed,q pelican are you feeling comfortable that youre reaching the point where a lot of the roles are being filled a geoff goodman i think so i mean ana was a huge one for healers who had kind of a lack of healing i think theres definitely some room in tanks still a lot of the tanks we have – we have dva and winston who are both kind of dive tanks – have ways to jump in and cause a lot of chaos and then we have sort of zarya and roadhog zaryas kind of like a hybrid support damage tank kind of everything roadhogs more kind of damage tank – theyre kind of hybridy reinhardts kind of the only one thats kind of the frontline guy im just gonna stand in front everyone get behind me ill soak a bunch of damage for everybody maybe theres a spot there another spot or competition for him maybe but by and large were in a pretty good spot i think sombras really going to mix some stuff up in the way that she plays we have a lot of really crazy ideas still to come so well have to see
Overwatch,removed,q pelican reclassification of characters is that something you feel might be necessary and hows symmetra doing a geoff goodman to answer the first question its always been kind of interesting to me how often i see that because the roles dont actually mean anything originally we werent even going to have that but as we started to plan for heroes were just going to have this line of faces its like reading a block of text i need paragraphs here its just like maybe we should separate this a little bit to make them make a little bit more sense and you know its easier to kind of grasp what youre seeing so that was actually the original point of them to make it more understandable and readable symmetra is the only sort of support hero that doesnt have any healing is that right yeah thats right so like why are you in the healer role she should be in defense we could do it but the game wouldnt really change for it she could just move over there part of the reason were kind of holding on to the idea of the support role instead of just renaming it healer is because i think theres a broader category there thats potentially a lot more interesting like i said symmetra originally started as a support character but she wasnt healing at all she was just kind of debuffing everybody and wasnt doing a lot of damage and that had its own problems – we couldnt really go through with that like conceptually that could still work where support characters as a role are intended to sort of magnify your teams damage and effectiveness as opposed to presenting their own i think that is a much nicer broader category to play with than just healers certainly you need healing in the game well do that a lot more but kind of holding out for that reason
Overwatch,removed,q turik whats your favorite part about designing a new character – whats your eureka moment a geoff goodman my favorite part is probably the eureka moment cause we actually have pretty cool and pretty robust tools so i can reiterate pretty quickly so ill take something thats like a paper design – at this point i dont even do raw paper design anymore i used to just have a document where it had what i was planning but the tools are fast enough and it can iterate fast enough that lots of time ill just work in the tool directly and mock something up and its all using like other peoples skins and other peoples art and everything – im not an artist im just trying to get something working when i first get a prototype out there and we get the first playtest its like that moment of is this good do people like this is this what people like a lot of time people are like this was really cool but i dont get why hes getting this thing and then you change one thing and then its like oh i loved it this is great and then its like okay we got it were going that way i love that and its just like getting that moment a geoff goodman iteration is super important to blizzard as a culture – were all about iteration so everything we have we have tools that are called hoverloading i can have the game open and change something and it goes into the game instantly i dont have to relaunch the game let alone recompile the build its not even just making tweaks to characters ill like build a character and itll reflect into the game as im building it so that is super important because again its just all iteration try this try this it didnt work and the faster i can do this the better
Overwatch,removed,q turik i want to make sure we get to the questions about like junkensteins revenge before sombra that was a big thing people were like does this mean pve is a real thing cause i know early on pve was like were not doing pve and then the halloween event was kind of pve so how do you guys feel about that now a geoff goodman that was definitely deliberate you know a lot of us working for overwatch worked on world of warcraft which was predominantly pve and so we always are wondering what would this game be like pve obviously when we were making the game in the beginning we were razor focused on this game we wanna make but now that its out people are exploring other things and junkensteins revenge gave us an opportunity to try pve and see what it felt like and gauge response you know we build this community thats now sort of hardcore pvp game and we werent sure if people were going to accept the pve side like what are you doing this is not this game but no by and large everyone really loved it and they wanted it to stick around all the time they wanted more of them i mean we dont have any direct plans right now to announce or anything but i think we were pretty excited by the response so were pretty interested in continuing it q pelican probably one of the top threads i saw on roverwatch during that time was someone saying like this helped me aim better a geoff goodman yeah ive actually seen that a lot on ana too people were like i didnt want to play ana but then i did because this was here shes really fun and ive started to play her in quickplay
Overwatch,removed,q sprite do you think that seeing all that positive feedback will allow you guys to make instead of the smaller subtle changes maybe bigger more swingy for lack of a better term changes a geoff goodman potentially i mean we should be careful with it i dont want to like swing a huge hammer every time to react to something you know a lot of times the metagame will shift by itself you know weve seen ana for example got put out and she did get buffed a little bit a week after she was put out she got increased firerate and magazine size but even after that she wasnt played for a really long time and then it took zenyatta being nerfed i guess well try ana holy crap shes amazing and now shes like the centerpiece of everything – like she wasnt actually changed you guys just didnt play her q turik even at the pro level there is that comfort zone like you know they want to say like oh ive been playing this hero for hours i know everything about her but you look and a week later its completely different a geoff goodman yeah its really been an interesting question at the world cup for example cause you have obviously players like shadowburn on genji is just ridiculous its like a whole other level – and you kind of get it with that character like wow you know people always say genji has a crazy skillcap and everything but then you have like other people say like oh yeah thats true but like winston is an easy one for example but then you watch muro on winston and its just like hes on another level with that character so theres a lot to learn a lot of depth to these characters and where you position and how you play them
Overwatch,removed,q turik do you feel like these kind of swingy as in the changes that are being thrown in – do you think the timing is related to the overwatch open and the world cup and stuff a geoff goodman not really this patch is going to be in between seasons which is kind of nice that was where ideally we can do it that way where its not just in the middle of a season where youre playing competitive and everythings drastically different and in this ptr i specifically wanted to try something different where we made much more serious changes to see and iterate on and get feedback and i expected i would like put them out and then for a couple of days get feedback and probably change some stuff but a lot of it worked pretty well right away so it was like uhh actually i dont want to get in there and mess with it if its kind of working so i was sort of surprised that post originally that was like dont freak out were just trying some stuff q turik people seemed to go oh this is good right away a geoff goodman we had both side of it we had some people that were like i thought they said these were going to be major and the other people were like what are you doing – thats crazy now
Overwatch,removed,q pelican kind of related to that with competitive now being so obviously a big part in like the league being announced and everything how much is that having a play into design choices is it still the same have you always kind of had that or is it suddenly a little more noticeable in designing and balancing a geoff goodman sometimes i mean what it comes down to is those guys play the game a lot obviously and they have dissected it to a degree much further than most people have so its interesting to see what their conclusions are to that especially in the comps that they play and a lot of what theyre picking are comps that they feel like dont have a strong counter cause you know cause they feel like they can run it all the time and not care what youre running so you see reinhardt a lot of times as an example cause reinhardt doesnt really have a strong counter sure you can flank him maybe if you can get behind him then he has to turn his shield and thats a huge problem especially if youre reaper or something that can tear him down quick so he has some kind of counters but its not like reaper vs winston kind of counter – like thats a really serious one so in a way it wasnt a direct response to reinhardt but it is nice that sombra is going to be able to really affect that meta cause you know hacking reinhardt and dropping his shield is a massive advantage to your team especially if you had the reinhardt and you were doing the stalemate and trying to break eachothers shields and it just like drops and its like whoa we win that sweet and the prevalence of the barrier abilities like winstons bubble and zarya and reinhart so her ultimate breaks all that its an ultimate you cant do that too often but its a huge swing for your team as i mentioned she had sort of a support role originally so she kept some of that vibe she got a lot of alleyoops for her team where its not like death blossoming herself but she enables all that so i think she is going to shift the meta quite a bit it wasnt like an explicit goal from the onset doing that but most of the time when were trying to make changes to that to the meta its more just changes to the current heroes that are around and theres a lot of stuff on the ptr right now that were changing up – you know buffs to widowmaker and characters that dont see a lot of play of right now so that might just help as well
Overwatch,removed,are there any irl suicide booths
Overwatch,removed,who do you think youre talking to im referencing the original meme faggot you dont know enough about this fuck off poser cunt

Overwatch,removed,obviously not that though thats shit
Overwatch,removed,stop stop first overwatch uses prediction for almost every single action in the game this means any action you take will happen instantly on your screen regardless of your latency to the server this means that the time between you clicking and seeing that input on the screen is only determined by your computer and your screen do you really think the game wouldnt feel horrible if all of your actions were delayed by anywhere from to ms second when people talk about input lag and responsivness they mostly talk about mouse input its very rare for a game to have fucked up keyboard input and in fps games the input lag for mouse movement is much more important and makes a much bigger difference than keyboard input lag your mouse movements dont need confirmation from the server thats just a retarded assertion this wasnt the case even in ancient games that had no lag compensation whatsoever please please please do one simple google search before commenting if you have no idea what youre talking about
Overwatch,removed,then stop acting like blizzard is giving me a handicap because of this tiny change quit acting like a fucking brainless idiot blowing some stupid shit out of proportion acting like a change like this is on the same level as an aimbot or a literal failsafe then i wont call you a kid until youre ready to do that you can get the fuck out of my thread

Overwatch,removed,lol why did heshe give up like that
Overwatch,removed,tldr type in ¯ツ¯ for proper formatting actual reply for the ¯ツ¯ like you were trying for you need three backslashes so it should look like this when you type it out ¯ツ¯ which will turn out like this ¯ツ¯ the reason for this is that the underscore character this one is used to italicize words just like an asterisk does this guy since the face of the emoticon has an underscore on each side it naturally wants to italicize the face this guy ツ the backslash is reddits escape character basically a character used to say that you dont want to use a special character in order to format but rather you just want it to display so your first is just saying hey i dont want to italicize ツ so it keeps the underscore but gets rid of the backslash since its just an escape character after this you still want the arm so you have to add two more backslashes two not one since backslash is an escape character so you need an escape character for your escape character to displayconfusing i know anyways i guess thats my lesson for the day on reddit formatting lol caution probably very boring edit as to why you dont need to escape the second underscore read only if youre super bored or need to fall asleep edit the reason you only need an escape character for the first underscore and not the second is because the second underscore which doesnt have an escape character doesnt have another underscore with which to italicize reddits formatting works in that you need a special character to indicate how you want to format text then you put the text you want to format then you put the character again for example you would type italicize or italicize in order to get italicize since we put an escape character we have italicize and dont need to escape the second underscore since theres not another nonescaped underscore with which to italicize something in between them so technically you could have written ¯ツ¯ but you dont need to since theres not a second nonescaped underscore you would need to escape the second underscore if you planned on using another underscore in the same line but not if you used a line break aka pressed enter twice if you used an asterisk later though on the same line it would not work with the nonescaped underscore to italicize to show you this you can type italicize and it should not be italicized
Overwatch,removed,im sorry you dont have any sort of life
Overwatch,removed,you are the definition of the saddest man alive
Overwatch,removed,this is nothing to celebrate you have had no fucking life for the past months since the game has been released you should take a step back and think about this you sad pathetic man child who the fuck has this much free time and leads a normal life
Overwatch,removed,support himself thats the thing if its his mom or something paying for his shit then what happens when she dies what is he going to tell employers when hes a year old man that has never worked a job in his life streaming is not consistent pay even and this dudes streaming stats are far below average it wouldnt fly on a job resume and people arent going to follow you for more than years if youre someone like op assuming he gets popular some day streaming is a deadend career even if you somehow got it to work for years cause the moment you lose popularity you have nothing to fall back on maybe not even a burger flipping job will hire someone who is years old that never worked before this is not something that should be congratulated on maybe if the frame was painted differently youd see how bad it is to congratulate this behavior if someone was a lb overweight year old man living with his mom while shes forced to work jobs to support him as he just stays in his room eating chips and watching anime you guys will be glad to jump at that person to tell him its wrong to be a leech right now on the surface it sounds like someone who just plays a game a lot but deep down you you know the truth op is a loser
Overwatch,removed,im gonna be honest here you really need to do something with your life
Overwatch,removed,its crazy to see so much support for a person who wasted hours of their life in a game that just recently came out this is just mindblowing how you call this an achievement when in reality you just wasted your life playing a video game this is very sad

Overwatch,removed,punch his face into a wall and when he retaliates with a left hook dodge down and leap forward headbutting his stomach if u do it right he will recoil because all the air will be knocked out of him grab his face with your palm then throw him out a window find some silverware and throw it out of the window onto him then jump out the window and elbow is face into the dirt spit in his bleeding face then tell him if he doesnt try overwatch youll do that whole process to him over and over again

Overwatch,removed,ive made my point continue to spew unintelligent shit if you want
Overwatch,removed,if you think that using a mic doesnt help you in overwatch you are retarded all the best teams use them for a reason and if youre not trying to be the best go play quick play that was my point in case you lost it in all your bullshit i really cant continue to talk to someone that has such a skewed view on fps i expected more from a pc player i only play seriously go google why using a mic is beneficial in overwatchmaybe some education is what you need mdg

Overwatch,removed,you realize this dread guy is triggerbotting right so glad these moron cheatershackers post there shit makes it so much easier for blizzard to put them on the ban wave typical csgo players coming to overwatch to cheat gj his crosshairs adjusted automatically to the center of the opposing players heads
Overwatch,removed,its not inaccurate your theory is moot stop trying to negate from the fact is this dude is a cheat its clearly relevant from this potg using a dot from one head to the other without a miss from shots and all ults no dude this guy is cheating pure and simple anyone one with common sense can clearly see that i hope this guy gets on a ban using that triggerbot
Overwatch,removed,taimou got caught for cheating and seagull uses poor mechanics with genji before his animation got cancelled users or more have already been banned from this game already i wouldnt post solo que videos anymore considering the relevant issue many people are getting called out for cheating widowmaker mcree are the biggest champs that players are using for triggerbotsaim bots this guy seems to cover up his mistake lol guess we see on the next ban wave
Overwatch,removed,please upvote this so people can see this exploit has being going since came out what it basically does it lets you play with whoever you want it doesnt matter what skill rating they are what teir theyre in hell what level they even are yes you can actually play with lvl on comp if you do this exploit on even a banned player can play with this exploit basically the person you wanna play with joins as soon as you start searching for a comp game say you wanna play with a gold tier player and your grand master obviously you cant hence the new rules but you can make a mic party let your gold tier friend who you wanna play comp with joins the mic party hold a countdown so he joins as soon as you start searching for a comp game bam he joins and the skill rating of the group bugs and forced to adjust with the gold tier player free elo for the gm teir player
Overwatch,removed,days late fag
Overwatch,removed,your a weird cunt
Overwatch,removed,so youre sticking up for someone who cheats nice job clearly relevant on the potg also of csgo players have known to cheat as well sorry dread you may call it skill and posting a potg in reddit when knowing there is a huge amount of players who aimbot and trigger seems to be astronomical love it when kids post shit and other players calling them out and still hide behind the truth
Overwatch,removed,he had time space httpsyoutubelqoizhfhea

Overwatch,removed,people are going to say it doesnt matter because it doesnt this is a game about scientist monkeys and solders who somehow just wont die shooting at each other in an arena it doesnt address sex from either side and it really shouldnt unless they want to go deeper with the comics which are currently just fleshing out the world because it would add nothing to the game its about guns and bombs not personal lives but hey ive got you covered you want lbgt stuff in overwatch loads of it right here
Overwatch,removed,for more discussion check rcompetitiveoverwatch

Overwatch,removed,dont be a faggot few people want to play support because its often a thankless job despite the fact that its often a main reason a team can do as well as they do its not essential but its nice to feel appreciated
Overwatch,removed,its harder to do anatomy than a cartoon shirt fuc boi its intention not a cop out
Overwatch,removed,means enough for you too cry like a lil bitch and downvote my opinion kys
Overwatch,removed,yeah its hard sometimes having to live knowing of the wastes of skin talking to you fucks is like looking for meaningful content in a soap opera all one big pantomime of subjective views of reality flurries of motion on dim screens with layers of halfhearted colors behind it to simulate a background or some kind of framework its abrasion of the hollow sort and youll all outlive me thats the pity id like to believe but unlike you i cant find concentration in fear or truth in solid mass just sit and watch the play endlessly be excited for a minute at the entrance if a new player at the turn of the arc but with so many useless minds it takes years for character to finish its transient range and after the realtime its slow and grating with no background to delve into and after a while it just wears on you its it that formless semiotic that turns brilliance into suffocatingly secure normalcy sets adrift the moments of life so it gets so isolated have you ever tried to kill yourself with stimulants its fun at first and then its too much and then its nothing at all and for weeks afterwards you feel like youre going retarded like your bodys slowing down but then you realize that its just the fact that youll never be so present as you were in cardiac arrest thats what it is thats what you are thats what all of these shit people are theyre the cruel reminders that youre not what you could be that every single day for the rest of my life ill have to interact with you while i want to kill you for being so idle so meaningless so incidental fluff im so fucking tired of arguing with you idiots but im afraid if i dont take out my aggression this way ill end up actually killing the next fucker i meet whos wearing the functional equivalent of a drivers license but why do i bother talking to you you wont get it anyway make the quip id supply it to you but im not quite sure how your gimp mind will interpret this what with your lack of a framework for conceptual analysis running through your single state machine i wonder how badly it will be butchered whats it like to be your kind of stupid reply to me so ill know dont worry its not hard to read
Overwatch,removed,youre right it wasnt about her being gay nobody wants to see her kissing a dude either because we dont want to see the overwatch characters sexualized just what the hell is so hard for you retards to understand
Overwatch,removed,you are making a fool out of yourself and have stooped so low as to say what you say is what you are like a child saying now my observation if you being out of touch with reality which i backed up and saying it back to me you now say you can ask or demand whatever you want as if anyone said any different no you did not say such a thing you said you had available options to demand that insinuates some legal or moral standing to do so which you dont so get out of here with your word games and backtracking it is to blizzard to decide whether to do or not no shit did i say any different no and neither i nor they dont require you to decide what both of us can or can not ok you are starting to go full retard now why are you quoting disability now what in the world do you think it is a blessing its called a disability like i said you are out of touch with reality im not calling you lame but the legal and rightful description of disabled its a disability get over yourself yes you arent in touch with reality you are proving it over and over i do not admit that im just a colorblind piece of shit that should sit quietly so i keep do this my way you said it not me neither did i insinuate such a thing once again you are out of touch with reality you cant handle any criticism and once again and all along start your self pity game thats what year olds do also not that i care but your english is semiincoherent so perhaps you are a child thank you for your reply if you were thankful and happy with my reply because of the happy face how come you resorted to going full retard and playing the pity game your underlying message says one thing then you tell me another anyways since you are so impaired i suggest you buy those glasses since youre disabled if you ever want to be able play the game anytime soon if not have fun looking for attention on reddit

Overwatch,removed,youre a fucking idiot especially if you think you have full control over the outcome of a game when therere players the more players the less impact you have individually i am not bad not the best i average kills a game more specifically like same shit though and about minutes objective time my placement was and solo i dropped to youre a fucking troll shit poster faggot if youre trying to tell me i can carry disconnects every other game bastion attacks and just pure uncoordinated even when i suggest tactics and plays garbage teams every game with level on my team vs level on the enemy with full stars not an exaggeration and i dont know what would explain it its consistent manning though i carry but the difference is people listen and arent as shit i can depend on them some at least opposed to randoms

Overwatch,removed,so much of your life is controlled by a game youre not mad at other players for being bad youre mad at yourself because so much of your self worth is completely dependent on being mediocre at a video game when you lose you mask the disappointment of how shitty youve let your life become by pushing blame onto other players sad af people expect so little of you and you still end up disappointing them id be mad too

Overwatch,removed,lmao its pricks like you that ruin comp i dont like micromanagers but if you cant take light criticism or suggestion then fuck off to quick play
Overwatch,removed,years old butt of year old
Overwatch,removed,user umountjeep this is the deleted post not letting a coward run away from his bad opinions one thing i really dislike is all cheap tactics blizzard included in this game infinite range autoaim turrets freezing abilities stun abilities ice wall creating abilities see through walls abilities heal everyone around you speed up everyone around you etcso many abilities that are just cheap and mess up the gameplay and fluidity of it all the characters dont feel balanced they all just feel very cheap to use in their own way there is a reason why most fpss exclude those type of abilities and if they are included they are limited to only uses per match limited ammo for flashbangs or stun grenades but having all these abilities on cooldown every seconds is just annoying and disruptive
Overwatch,removed,your point is flawed in one huge way you fail to remark upon what character you are playing when a faggot reaper edgelord speaks up into chat and wants someone to switch hey sorry bro maybe the reaper was the one who should switch point being unless you play as a support character your opinion on other people switching characters will always be met with the thought of fuck you you should switch if you care that much rather than telling other people to switch
Overwatch,removed,who cares you fucking autists its a little symbol on a portrait stop sperging out
Overwatch,removed,good one man im gonna go cry ttyl xox enjoy wanking over hypothetical game relationships

Overwatch,removed,it should be called hot mother on daughter action
Overwatch,removed,can you please kill yourself
Overwatch,removed,these suggestions are absolutely and utterly retarded and the only thing needed is for you to pull your head out of your ass ana is objectively the most difficult hero in the game to use effectively and she has already been nerfed twice any further nerfs will just further take away from her character identity and what makes her fun and unique buff mercy or introduce more healers to make the meta more diverse not nerf ana to the ground because other healers are in a shitty spot idiocy

Overwatch,removed,the fart was edited in apparently
Overwatch,removed,this is why you are a basement dwelling fedora wearing redditor people like you are useless
Overwatch,removed,top posts from rgetdownmrmondatta i am a bot
Overwatch,removed,are blizzard fucking retarded symmetra needs a massive nerf what stupid fucking cunt would think a support hero should have the highest dps possible the smallest hitbox possible a slow thats not putting her in danger in any way the most powerful ult in the game and the fucking ability to come at you with her own personal rein shield making her literally immortal to anyone all she has to do is deploy a shield and walk behind it as she melts everyone oh you got on the point well too fucking bad theres symm sentries by the point and you have no way to escape because of the slow she has literally no counter winston shell kill him in seconds while he is taking out her turrets that she can put up again with cooldown shes so fucking op and blizzard is the most biased fucking hypocritical company ive ever heard of jeff kaplan should be killed
Overwatch,removed,not if youre a shit player no
Overwatch,removed,i cant wait til we play each other ill be the one getting more kills than you while having everyone muted and listening to rap music permalinksaveparentedit
Overwatch,removed,choke on my nigger cock
Overwatch,removed,faggot
Overwatch,removed,lmao
Overwatch,removed,hard to do what theyll do in the long run since one is while the other isnt but is completely monetized now contracts come to mind and theyve pretty much ignored it almost completely at this point i know that the whole trading ecconomy is a big part i bought overwatch with an unusual but thats a bit different
Overwatch,removed,fuck dirty ignorant arabs and fuck islam
Overwatch,removed,tracer wants some gash
Overwatch,removed,oh i stand corrected then i guess it was cropped to prevent giving players an edge nevermind

Overwatch,removed,its the rape culture s
Overwatch,removed,uhm where are these people ive played with a lot of girls in comp and never seen anything like this maybe a hoe or cunt here and there but thats not for girls only
Overwatch,removed,attention whores and white knights this thread in a nutshell
Overwatch,removed,out of all the things that didnt happen this one happened the least
Overwatch,removed,definitely seems interesting ive always thought something like that was missing on the esportgaming scene will keep an eye on it and invite couple of friends
Overwatch,removed,oh my god this same post again we dont give a shit youre a women who the fuck cares if you dont have thick skin just dont join voice chat is really that hard gee im sick of the same posts every week
Overwatch,removed,yeah you said it yourself its a joke why should anyone be banned for a joke nobody is ever safe from sjw fuckery these days are they
Overwatch,removed,the joke is that vegans love cock as much as healsluts
Overwatch,removed,what so if somebody got into a gunfight we cant make jokes about gunfights we should stop all jokes cause somebody doesnt find it funny whenever someone gets upset the response is it was a fucking joke because chances are it was a fucking joke ye peoples mums die dont mean we cant make jokes about them you silly cunt the irony in you telling people to think first before spouting bullshit lmfao jokes cant be made because someone might be offended classic sjw oh and to top it all off label me as a sociopath cause im not an sjw clown like you le reddit boys and girls where losers try to justify their lives through nonissues
Overwatch,removed,verbally lynched haha its fucking hilarious from my perspective as youre just exactly that throwing words like verbally lynched and sociopathic when you have no clue on what it actually means what im on the wrong side of history saying that all topics are fair game for jokes im gonna get verbally lynched how by you im sociopathic because some armchair psychiatrist says i am please like literally youre making a deal out of some kid that used the word rape instead of shit on for all linguistic purposes if someones precious soul cant handle a word appearing on your screen anyhow maybe you shouldnt be playing in an competitive environment but nah sociopath here haha you should try that in real life and see how far your sjw bullshit goes
Overwatch,removed,fuck off with your mansplaining first of all i never said guys make them all the time i said really fucking much and frankly any amount of rape jokes is really fucking much and i really dont need to be told by a guy how hes bawww called a fag when i have gotten fucking death and rape threats and literally have had some crazy ass man in a game somehow look up where i live and shit based on nothing but my first name youre a part of the problem instead of saying if i ever see this happen ill definitely call them out on it you just make it sound like women are pussies for getting upset over internet insults and should just ignore and move on too fucking bad that its a lot bigger a problem than internet insults and one that deserves to be addressed even if its mostly harmless in most cases
Overwatch,removed,bored of you now manchild i felt kinda hurt being called an sjw at first since im not but whatever fuckface bored of your shit
Overwatch,removed,console
Overwatch,removed,youre a retard think for your self i do not know what is wrong with retards in this world like you incapable of critically thinking incapable of anything you can simply test it it takes literally minute instead though you repeat shit like a mindless baby as rhetoric for your peers why do you crave so much attention and acceptance fucking disgusting
Overwatch,removed,rcummingonfigurines would blow up

Overwatch,removed,whats funny is that trudeau has already bent at the knee for trump d dont act like its not going to effect you and that it doesnt have worldwide implications people are sick of liberal shit d
Overwatch,removed,how far is your head up your ass mate seen you comment around this sub and everything that emerges from your fingers is arrogant and shite go to bed
Overwatch,removed,however personal attacks are not tolerated what who gives a flying fuck about the person if they are prepared to tell people that women should get used to being raped the fuckers name should be out to see for the whole world to see
Overwatch,removed,op youre an idiot
Overwatch,removed,why do i feel like you are one of those who got bullied back in high school what a pathetic generation of easily offended weaklings everyone steps over you and instead of fighting back you come to your safe space to cry grow some thick skin and show them the middle finger have some fucking respect for yourself
Overwatch,removed,you must be less blatant with your retardation child how mad are you that i own you

Overwatch,removed,and a good widow should be able to get a headshot on the winston trying to get on her youre just playing on a low level where widow is doing jack shit while on high level she really is a big problem either that or youre a cucked widow main in denial

Overwatch,removed,now it is hey everyone overwatch esp wallhack is readily available and being used by large numbers of players so dont waste your money on this game it is infested with hackers
Overwatch,removed,too bad you cant suck dick for a living huh
Overwatch,removed,fucking trash ass niggy
Overwatch,removed,you are a gigantic piece of shit
Overwatch,removed,makes childish elementary school level comedy videos on youtube becomes because famous everyone dick rides on the talentless train its self explanatory if people had brains to think of there is a difference in talent vs timing everything you make is complete brainless content
Overwatch,removed,are any of these things physically stopping a woman by physicallegal force from going shirtless in public no there doesnt need to be laws to stop women from doing something thats moronic its how men make women feel its a stigma the same way in some job fields men make women feel unwelcome so they choose a different career path nothing is legally stopping them but fuck if i want to purposely make my life hell thats like saying there is no law to stop people from locking their doors at night its the fear of someone breaking in that makes you lock your door not a law stupid argument honey if i followed society and peer pressure then i would have a wife right now but i dont i have a boyfriend because my happiness is more important to me than what society tells me i should be if everyone just followed society then there wouldnt even be lgbt rights people make huge differences by working against society i too wouldnt have a girlfriend however as lgbt people were more accustomed to naturally going against the grain others not so much and unfortunately thats a lot of people thats more of a hygene thing hair tends to grow in places where a lot of sweat is made so the sweat tends to stay in the hair funny we dont have sweat on our foreheads or our backs for the most part some men have very hairy backs also why is it just women then men sweat far more than women and less effectively in comparison it also does not have to do with hygienic unless youre ignorant no hair does not equal hygienic you can have hair and be perfectly clean if you take showers often like you should i think youre confusing hygienic with neatness which is wrong all people should be hygienic hell in medieval times it was socially unacceptable to shower too often if nobody went against society then it still would be it still is not okay to shower too often according to science not society you should shower every other day not every day or multiple times a day again hair has nothing to do with hygiene do you know what a knight is here is the first google image result of white knight knights were the police of medieval times so yeah youre telling me theyre all white knights then as an someone who is entering the police academy as well ill be sure to tell them some moron thinks were all white knights when they say wtf ill tell them the best part that you have no idea what people who use it mean and youre using some oxford definition of it no really guys knights were the police in old days and thats what we are were all white knights not just a knight but a white one too neat sorry but i would rather believe the oxford dictionary over urban dictionary a website that says women prefer large dicks in the very definition of the word women a website that is trollish yes but also has the general populace meaning of phrases and slang erm what if a woman pulled me out of a burning car saved my life then i would call her a white knight thats what the word means i suggest you take an english lesson i refuse to believe youre this dumb erm what me thinking of people saving other people makes me a misandrist lmao what is this logic this logic is that the vast majority of people who know the term white knight do not think its simply someone saving them it means some guy who is coming to the aid of a woman and looking to get laid its misandrist because it assumes that a men just want sex all the time and b that they cant just also agree with a womans opinion without wanting to get in her pants there is no way i believe youre being sincere in your official white knight definition do you have a source of me stating this i as a gay male would happily help a woman in need and with me being gay and all would definitely not want to be repaid by getting laid you used the term white knight if i use a swastika no one is going to think im using it sincerely and not making a hitler reference i called you a white knight because you was acting all defensive on behalf of tracer a character that doesnt even exist while at the same time shaming her a character that doesnt exist body type i can act defensive over whatever i want i was also not shaming her body type not a single person was there have however been people mocking her body type and the way she looks to in their mind get back at the sjw menace conspiracy theory nuts you obviously do not and you do except you are saying that the vast majority of women do not find muscles attractive which is extremely false i did not say that i think youre confusing sexy with attractive you confuse a lot of things meanwhile in western europe which has more gamers than the us womens breasts are no more taboo than a males yet overwatch has a bare chested man and not a bare chested woman and you are saying that women are more sexualised also again taboo does not equal sexual a women can be sexualized and not naked if i need to explain this to you youre not worth my time i really dont give two shits about europe of what the custom is there i live in america and have to deal with american customs the penis is a sexual organ so is the vagina neither a womans boobs or a mans chest are sexual organs and are therefore not sexual this is not to say that they are not sexy both are sexy to different people indeed the breasts and ass of a women are not sexual organs but have been sexualized vastly by men throughout the ages while men have not in the same way for women its really a power dynamic it isnt taboo at all many christians use satan as a scapegoat no shit sherlock but its still taboo there is no talk of demons ghostsspirits except the holy spirit or satan in a lot of christian homes many christians believe the mere mention is enough to open some kind of door to allow evil stuff into the home they wont allow anything even seemingly evil into the home this includes books music movies games art etc untrue in places where this game is most targeted to america when did i stop talking about america holy shit well you are still incorrect uh no im not since im talking about america and we seem to have a disdain for female nipples since when is breastfeeding taboo most countries in the first world where overwatch is targeted to outright ban businesses from turning away breastfeeding mothers i have seen breastfeeding mothers many times in public and it has never been an issue for anyone it is literally one of the most natural things there is i agree its natural doesnt mean america has caught up yet why do most states still allow a homeowner to shoot a person in their home you mean when they are breaking and entering to defend themselves why are some states not letting transgendered people use the bathroom of their gender why are some states fighting gay marriage why are some states paying their disabled poor less than the equivalent of minimum wage why are most states enacting the death penalty why are most states using christianity in law oh yeah because the usa is a messed up country that has nothing to do with this topic it is and its what i have been talking about the entire time again i dont give a shit what is happening in europe you have no room to sit there and be like well everything is dandy in my country so i dont know why you cant see that this isnt an issue good for fucking you but this isnt about your country something that most straightbi women and gaybi men are attracted to attraction is fine again you cant honestly believe that they made her ass smaller because it was about her ass they didnt make her ass smaller wtf they changed her pose cause that was all it was about not a single article i read on the issue said they also reduced the size of her ass nor did a dev state it source looks like a lot of tribal women are bisexual if you get aroused looking at the same gender then you are gaybisexual it was the modern society woman that got aroused not the tribal women i agree a man has a nipple showing but no woman does men are far more sexualized in this game male nipples are not sexual so im not sure how you can say that a mans muscular chest is different to just his nipple showing genji has a butt as big as tracers and it has a strap going down the middle to make it stand out more genji is literally a cyborg that grey you see is his skin imagine if tracer was just wearing that tight thong i can find no source that states that the grey is his skin hes a cyborg yes but that doesnt mean hes not wearing some kind of outfit in the short dragons his mask opens and we see some of his face so im more inclined to think hes wearing something and isnt a naked robot implying that gay men are not normal or part of society way to fucking strawman exactly just because you dont find something sexual does not mean the far majority doesnt muscles are sexy to the far majority of women did i say muscles arent sexy did i state muscles are not sexy period meanwhile you are bodyshaming a video game character for having a body you disagree with show me where i was and you have no idea how society sees sex because you state that women do not find muscles attractive so i apparently stated that muscles are not sexy or attractive hmmm its almost like you get shit confused continued in second post

Overwatch,removed,i did ive asked for screenshots multiple times you asked the people that pasted their conversation logs for screenshots where did you do that i see no reason to fake these others might have their reasons but i personally cant see one but since people have been caught lying about getting wrongfully silenced in other games even other blizzard games i see no reason why the same thing wouldnt happen in overwatch the issue is why would they lie about support claiming bans take place via threshold effect specifically theres no benefit to doing so except said sample barely backs up your point besides all ive asked for is a screenshot of the conversation with the support reps that shouldnt be hard to get considering multiple people have claimed that they have talked to support reps which have denied it again did you ask the people who pasted their conversations for the screenshots oh so you didnt even read the rest of the comments gotcha yeah because the fact that you clearly try and hide your stats doesnt make it perfectly clear that youre just trolling at this point how am i hiding my stats most people dont offer their name and battle tag like you do use common sense there we go with the insults again fucking idiots cant even troll properly please learn the difference between a troll and a jerk serious question do you have autism
Overwatch,removed,wow youre stupid op linked me to others as proof of what he was saying was correct i said that we had no reason to believe those people as they had nothing that backed up what they were saying is true op said they had posted conversations with support reps i said it was posted in plain text which is not credible since its easy to modify if they had posted a screenshot of the conversation it would have been credible again you are the one that believes the conversations are fabricated you asked op for the screenshots rather than the people who actually had the conversations you are the idiot here lets see you have mentioned others that claimed the same thing has happened to them which would be good proof that its true if it is a large number of people experiencing the same thing but since you guys posted around its more likely to be outliers or people encountering a bad support person not doing their job properly how many links did you expect to be provided for you there are similar cases all over the blizzard forums but yea i guess its more likely people randomly made up the exact same story with zero benefit to themselves because thats more likely than you being wrong apparently of course people would do that in fact youre a fucking moron if you think otherwise i think you might be mentally retarded people would lie for absolutely no gain are you understanding what youre saying here or is your autism overwhelming you youre taking things too literally my good idiot oh and wheres your stats oh right you didnt post them so youre hiding them you alluded to me not sharing my profile which most people dont for plenty of reasons and then claimed i didnt show it when asked i was never asked for it youre just too stupid to understand the difference its pretty clear that youre just trolling at this point come back when you have some actual proof of what op is claiming is correct dont bother commenting before that ill be waiting just like im still waiting for op mom hes disagreeing with me on the internet he must be a troll theres no way someone could disagree with me

Overwatch,removed,csgo cheater moved to overwatch cool dude
Overwatch,removed,apparently none of you realize uitsfodder is a proven cheater in csgo and a known troll i dont need to watch the video to know he probably deserved all the hate he got in this video stay away from overwatch fodder
Overwatch,removed,psa if you dont know who this guy is fodder is a known and proven cheater in csgo and became almost famous from it because of his downright crazy bullshit this guy is nothing more than an attention seeker and i can say a load of these clips will be because they knew who he is

Overwatch,removed,anti lgbt lmfao fuck outta here faggot lover
Overwatch,removed,this entire thread proven hacker i kekd
Overwatch,removed,i really hope theres a fix for this coming soon ive been playing lucioball pretty much nonstop since its release there are two users xycdashrk and deltorian on the na servers that have been running a script for the last days that just joins games and has them be afk the whole time because they know theyre not going to get kicked for doing it and its free exp for them i see these guys probably every or games and its insane that the number of reports they have probably racked up by now hasnt gotten them banned yet
Overwatch,removed,if you spam h while joining a lucioball game you sometimes can get a random hero or if you do it right you can pick a hero
Overwatch,removed,of course the very first game i played this morning deltorian was on the other team afking and i reported him then as well
Overwatch,removed,get that dildo out of your ass please its hilarous seeing a winston suddenly join your lucioball game i laughed my ass off these kind of exploits are just funny as fuck dont be such a baby its just a troll gamemode
Overwatch,removed,lol your name is cancer also go fuck yourself faggot
Overwatch,removed,by that logic most players should be rank because i am too what are you fucking stupid i really have no idea what youre referring to grow up and stop crying about cosmetics you cant own because your mom wont let you buy loot boxes
Overwatch,removed,it is you trigger it by trying to swap heros hitting h at the initial spawn or the reset between goals
Overwatch,removed,how did you decipher my age by just reading some text on the internet nice memes faggot
Overwatch,removed,so saying gay makes you homophobic i guess most people are homophobic because literally everyone says that sjw like you need lobotomized for being this brain dead

Overwatch,removed,fuck off you shouldnt be admin
Overwatch,removed,i have a simple question why is my post being removed i am advertising a software i created with overwatch tips that is on fiverrcom for unknown reasons this keeps getting removed and i am not getting a message saying why i read the rules and from what i can understand you can link your amazon page and other shopping centers so why not fiverr am i missing something if you could tell me why this post is being removed that would be great thanks
Overwatch,removed,lol you expect the year old cunt admin to be fair
Overwatch,removed,stfu nerd
Overwatch,removed,why was she going on a date with waluigi wiggerwednesday
Overwatch,removed,good i hope to see less xxshadowkillerxx you posted that snarky little comment in a thread here about how blizzard is offering free battletag renames youre exactly the type of person that is so wrong with this community and yet so prevalent here you preach good vibes and yet contradict yourself immediately by criticizing people for what battletag they want to have you need to grow up and take your own advice and worry about your own shitty battletag
Overwatch,removed,i never thought i was going to laugh coming into such a pointless thread but thank you i know all the anime fags are going to downvote you but thanks again

Overwatch,removed,boo
Overwatch,removed,oh come on please reinstate i missed it these threads are lighthearted and harmless and the games not even out yet

Overwatch,removed,there is a stickied specifically for questions like this
Overwatch,removed,how about you just play the real version of the game
Overwatch,removed,if your version of the game is so butchered by poor controls and afterthought patches to the point that trobjorn is killing it maybe you should play the proper version
Overwatch,removed,httpswwwredditcomrpcmasterracewikiguide
Overwatch,removed,thats neat ill repeat how about you play the real version where your abilities to react arent gimped by controllers seriously op i can sympathize if youre poor start a gofundme and ill drop fifty bucks
Overwatch,removed,console fps hahaha
Overwatch,removed,not a single good player is playing overwatch on a consoleyou are just bad players complaining on torbjorn
Overwatch,removed,pc master race
Overwatch,removed,lmao this subreddit is too much so many crying babies out there 😂 the whole argument on console is a straight joke or it reflects on the poor level of skill on it
Overwatch,removed,because blizzard is based in the us quit whining you eurotrash
Overwatch,removed,you get the world you deserve
Overwatch,removed,blizzpost
Overwatch,removed,doesnt look like this is getting a lot of visibility but i just want to say this is a fantastic post ever consider posting something like this over on roverwatchuniversity
Overwatch,removed,dont play on consoles
Overwatch,removed,sorry if someone already said this but play on pc or you dont like it
Overwatch,removed,they are not fucking arbitrary they are decided by the performance of the other team how is this more arbitrary than the arbitrary winning condition set by blizzard kill yourself
Overwatch,removed,in other words he pointed out that a literal nobody just won lets put together a hypothetical where eventually the facts could evolve to fit my interpretation you know im right at this point thats why youre bailing
Overwatch,removed,are you a faggot
Overwatch,removed,if that were true you would be presenting a counterargument instead of this joke i can tell youre not very bright either
Overwatch,removed,humour what i find gay people so disgusting natures failure
Overwatch,removed,pcmr
Overwatch,removed,toxic youre playing with random people on the internet for hours and youre bitxhing like a teen girl about people being toxic pull a tampon out of your ass and realize the feature was objectively stupid especially for ranks oh and grow a fucking pair

Overwatch,removed,maybe instead of being a dumb league twat you can realize the purpose of the matchmaker is to weed those sorts of players out from your games over time if you are in fact better than them doubtful and that the avoid feature being used to remove skilled or poor players is the reason its gone
Overwatch,removed,i wasnt making an argument i was making a statement now fuck off bro

Overwatch,removed,once the queue says game found just spam h until the game starts the random character can appear at the beginning of the game or after one goal is scored
Overwatch,removed,im flaming you for being below average intelligence the spelling is just the delicious frosting

Overwatch,removed,also blocked you fucking faggot go suck a dick and make up more lies dickheaf
Overwatch,removed,stfu nigger
Overwatch,removed,if youre trying to foster a competitive scene is is pretty stupid to balance the game around the lowtier he didnt say largest number he said lowend for example genji around is pretty god awful and useless lets buff his damage so people at that skillrange can use him uh oh now he has pickrate in pro play and is the strongest character by far torb is really good around the lowend so lets nerf him drop his damage and range until people around can deal with him uh oh now hes useless at a greater than sr you cant balance a game for the people that can barely play it if you want a competitive scene to exist you have to balance for the people who are playing correctly and are making money that said there are a certain kind of buff that help lowtier players without changing the highend these are generally qol quality of life changes like making symmetras shields stay on a character after they die sure highend players already put it back on low end players forget now shes stronger but not any better for the best players stuff like that is the only place you can look to buff for the lowtier
Overwatch,removed,a guy pose doesnt look good on a woman character youre a moron op
Overwatch,removed,you just said you dont know then you go on to disagree lol full retard here
Overwatch,removed,that niga dead
Overwatch,removed,lol if doing something in a fucking video game makes you feel like youve achieved something kill yourself because you really gotta fucking suck at life for something so small to make you feel so big understand you are fucking bad that rank is a fucking number youre not fucking good youre benefiting from your fucking team its not fucking you this must be console because there are people new to fps and they have been in the top for the last fucking month this game in no fucking way demonstrates skill and your fucking proof of it
Overwatch,removed,what youre saying makes no coherent sense anyways since youre so insistent that fluctuating by ranks happens all the time and since youre clearly not listening to my arguments why dont you go ahead and share a master overwatch profile of you or a friend or your brother or whatever it was who has fluctuated by ranks master overwatch tracks this maybe then what youre claiming will hold some validity
Overwatch,removed,ah the classic i cant come up with proof so im going to start attacking the person im arguing with instead glad to see youve finally run out of bullshit to espouse good day
Overwatch,removed,seyeumi point hours ago this is kinda random but do you know if mccrees lmb is hitscan or projectile thanks in advance if you know god you literally know nothing about this game why am i even humoring you

Overwatch,removed,what the fuck is it with these entitled brats all over the fucking subreddit going uh blizzard pls dont repeat x mistakes other game company made like the people who make the game are some sort of vapid halfwits incapable of forming coherent thoughts of their own i personally dont give a fuck whether youre fine with the hero releases or not who determines quality is ana quality what if sombra is slightly underwhelming after all this is that quality too will you post on reddit kindly informing blizzard that theyre making the same mistakes as x again all these shitty threads represent is a highschool girl level hairtwirl leik omg dont fuck up my game okay thank you op for sharing in your inscrutable fucking wisdom that change might sometimes be bad good job and fuck the rest of you that upvote this base tripe shame on you
Overwatch,removed,i want to squat over her head and feed her my bowel chilli shed get so horny

Overwatch,removed,fuck console plebs
Overwatch,removed,yet you want to be opinionated on the topic not particularly i just dont enjoy people like you bitching about something so great you just embarrass yourself to no end coming from someone who only has insults to pull out of their ass kid im not even a kid id sooner pin that on you fyi kid console aka cross platform patches and updates have been synced since era little boy square enix has been doing it for over a decade fyi final fantasy is what is called a mmo it was released on and was cross platform with the pc and is still going and still a month subscription only this year did they finally cut support oh so by square enix doing it since you meant a singular game my mistake wasnt aware that the had such refined games with online support doubt it was even that good after all its an mmo nostalgia glasses and all that however ya you kinda need the internet for a mmo moron and kinda a lot of people played online especially for a mmo to be made for it moron do tell i never said mmos never needed the internet to function that was on you for assuming kinda a lot of people played online oh really please do tell me that despite all of my time being on reddit and on all of the subreddits i browse this is the first time ive heard it mentioned im aware the had online capability but i think saying a lot of people played it is a bit of a stretch im almost embarrassed for you at this point youve made such a fool of yourself kid missed out a comma between yourself and kid do continue with the childish insults those theyre amusing ive never done a death teleporter but for youd id meik an exception i find that hard to believe nice pun though go ahead and make a death teleporter anyone who falls for it this far into the game is either a new player or just plain bad theres a reason that videos or posts about them arent as popular as before sometimes the herd needs to be thinned taking on the mantle of grim reaper are we now i believe its called natural selection something you dont need to interfere with at this point youre starting to sound like a serial killer who picks fights on the internet with people for fun anyway you got what you wanted i made a valid point have a great day and dont waste your time on replying as ive already reported and disabled inbox replies lifes too short to be frustrated so perhaps you should lighten up boop

Overwatch,removed,ryuugawagatekiwokurau
Overwatch,removed,i used to cheat on a fps game called crossfire and the aimbot worked like this you press a key and your aim will automatically go into the enemys head then you shoot im almost sure that op is aimbotting and he uses the crouching key to aim then he shoots just a video so you can see clearly what im talking about the guy on this video is aimbotting and he uses the scope buttonright click for the aimbot key the scope button is the best for aimbot snipping but this is not possible on widowmaker because she cant quickscope so he is using the crounching key instead

Overwatch,removed,i am not ignorant at all actually i am smart enough to know that kids today think that everywhere should be a safe space from harm guess what the world does not work that wayin the real world you are going to experience racism sexism intolerance and countless other things that may make you uncomfortablegetting hit on in a video game by a nameless faceless idiot is not the end of the world it amazes me that every kid today thinks that they should be immune to the real worldand this is our futureif so we are fucked
Overwatch,removed,okay snowflakeenjoy your safe space and good luck with life in the real world when you get there i have been married to the same woman for years who i love deeplyand she is a gamershe gets hit on constantly and you know whatshe hits the mute button problem solved so the only ignorance i see is the fact that the op cant be smart enough to mute them rather than get on this thread to complain
Overwatch,removed,i agree with this
Overwatch,removed,yes im putting a doctoral thesis together on this issue right now when i decided to pursue my phd ii really wanted to make an impact thank you overwatch for finally giving me the opportunity to put my research skills and training to a truly useful and amazing study like this if youd like a copy of the results when finished sign up for my newsletter at httpgoatsecx

Overwatch,removed,well fuck that then you done ruined it guess its time to school your ass some more my post cannot be xenophobic either it is not a person go to fucking school kid
Overwatch,removed,firstly the necesity is fear or hatred not simply dislike secondly it was your post that was deleted likely because i reported it as youre another of these cancerous people trying to make personal attackswitch hunts you called me something i am not without even understanding what it is and you still dont once again idiot my post cannot be xenophobic it is not a person even by your logic seeing as the post did not say anything that would imply xenophobia once again go read a fucking book and go to school
Overwatch,removed,how can i be wrong about asking if it is possible jesus why does everyone here have to be a hatefull little fucking kid who just wants to start shit fuck off with your bullshit

Overwatch,removed,you say that as if it hasnt already been done nsfw obviously thats just one of many
Overwatch,removed,no offense but are you okay do you have autism or is there another reason why you say shit like really makes you think all the time genuinely curious
Overwatch,removed,you are a fucking worthless brainded scumfuck bastard pile of trash mental dickface that should be gunned down in the street like the degenerate you are
Overwatch,removed,are you illiterate i wasnt stating anything was a solution o anything i was asking if there was a way to do this read the fucking op you autistic cunt i havent downvoted anything save for the few toxic posts that are nothing but baseless personal attacks by illiterate fucks like yourself i fucking ask a question about the goddamned spoken language and get attacked by a bunch of u pc brah faggots who get upset that i dont want to hear some fucking gibberish in other languages randomly spouted by my characters it would be acceptable if they always spoke moon babble but they fucking dont and its annoying as shit for me i paid for the goddamned game lord forbid i can ask a fucking question in this toxic shitlord fucking community about adjusting my own fucking settings to see if its possible go fucking kill yourself you worthless piece of trash
Overwatch,removed,i also found this its a triggerbot you can download for free kinda sad they are so common now
Overwatch,removed,zayria is obviously a dyke
Overwatch,removed,not as delish as the liberal tears were when trump won i assure you of that
Overwatch,removed,and what exactly is there to be especially proud of in being gay heres a fun fact for you you leftist piece of shit equality means nobody gets special treatment which is what we have now in overwatchexcept mercy mains
Overwatch,removed,rchimichanga
Overwatch,removed,because so many people say that we shouldnt be happy or proud of ourselves that we should be ashamed to be who we are and love who we love and obviously youre too much of brainwashed socialistic conformists to have your own opinion and not give a fuck about what others say nobody shames you for being straight or for loving the type of people that society says you should lvoe quick example thats one of your pride defenders youas in the pride defenders say you want equality which by scientific definition means nobody gets special treatment if there would be any gay flagwhich isnt exactly standarised btw there would also have to be the straight flag and in a few years if leftists activity in europe wont be stopped the infants husband flag
Overwatch,removed,yes its caled res good thing your to stupid to improve your internet experience guess that comes with being bigoted huh

Overwatch,removed,your life is fucking worthless if you need a game to validate anything holy shit take a step back and run straight into the nearest wall seriously
Overwatch,removed,when the sjws are on your ass so much you feel forced to make a character in your game a dyke
Overwatch,removed,muh ess jay dubyus
Overwatch,removed,oh people like this shouldnt exist because one get fucked
Overwatch,removed,stop being an idiot and pretending sjws havent already influenced this game and specifically tracer to the point where blizzard caved to appease them and only them take your naive head out of your ass
Overwatch,removed,cancer
Overwatch,removed,because of the population needs representation everywhere
Overwatch,removed,being gay isnt normal and those people who say its not a choice are retarded the lgbt community should stay hidden for all i care theyre a bunch of degenerates ruining society and spreading diseases
Overwatch,removed,because they are special snowflakes and therefore feel they must have overrepresentation of the population doesnt necessitate lgbts being everywhere i say this as someone who couldnt care less about tracers reveal facts are facts
Overwatch,removed,teenage angst ha yet fags can complain when they dont get a gay character and get praised for whining
Overwatch,removed,shame i voted for trumppence on the basis that theyd crack down on lgbt rights and send queer kids to therapy
Overwatch,removed,who gives a fuck about his online comments nothing he said was inflammatory you super sensitive sjw pussies are the ones that are beyond help
Overwatch,removed,sjws are never happy they are professional victims

Overwatch,removed,youre still a thottie qho got wd ruinedfaggg
Overwatch,removed,how stupid are you you ask a question and get a straight forward answer but you still question it even though you have no idea about what youre talking about
Overwatch,removed,no they arent they arent people because they defy gods rule
Overwatch,removed,you know the world could always use more faggots
Overwatch,removed,kill me
Overwatch,removed,imagine if your mum wouldnt push you wouldnt be here typing stupid overwatch tips
Overwatch,removed,
Overwatch,removed,so if a white person said use of words like nigger and coon can contribute to the oppression that black americans face thats racist thats literally using a word academically to identify a problem
Overwatch,removed,nice strawman need a hat
Overwatch,removed,why do americans love fags
Overwatch,removed,i dont have an argument so i am just going to insult you then walk away furiousxgeorge
Overwatch,removed,so what does that have to do with anything are you triggered that the gay might actually support not letting millions of antigay muslim terrorists into the us
Overwatch,removed,no one cares if youre gay or pan or bi stop ahem shoving it down our throats
Overwatch,removed,and there you go injecting politics into a video game get the fuck off your soapbox
Overwatch,removed,its obvious that zyra is the dyke
Overwatch,removed,in a nutshell artist was horny
Overwatch,removed,fucking too many cool hip strong independent women characters in all types of media league of legends is full of em starwars main character in two new movies both fucking girls overwatch ruined some of the cooler characters by having them just have to be female but on top of all that he bullshit one just has to be a fucking lesbian too like god damn its disgusting
Overwatch,removed,tldr hi im an autist i will now sperg for you the song of my people its a god damn video game it does not matter what digital bitch is boinking who they are pixels and polygons goddam
Overwatch,removed,lgbt is a stupid fucking term she isnt bi or trans
Overwatch,removed,i hate fags
Overwatch,removed,lol its fucking stupid how they take what could be cool characters and just fuck them up to appeal to fag hots quuers and women all of whom are normally worthless and its annoying they send this message that womans can be cool too but its just not realistic women in general are useless pieces of meat whos only redeaming quality is that men can fuck there sweet vaginas
Overwatch,removed,the best part of this whole thread is you keep calling me him and he when i am a trans female thank you for assuming that much about me since i go against the narrative that has been painted for you my response was hyperbole to your exclamation that people can be fired for being gay when in fact that is false us lgbt folk have more protections under the law than a straight white male has what actually happens is people claim to be fired for being gay and when the employers have released the facts for their dismissal after they received copious amounts of hatred from people like you it is proven that they were bad at their job your persecution complex is a disease
Overwatch,removed,kys fucking faggot at this point im fucking done im bisexual and your gonna sit here and tell me im a homophobe try doing something other than bitching maybe thatll help the goddamn problem
Overwatch,removed,youre saying that like theres people with torches pitchforks outside in irvine picketing the place until these demands are met to shoehorn theyre creative vision how can that possibly be in this case tracers a been mostly established character shes been there this whole time theres shippeople everything but no ones actively demanding anything no ones unfurling banners at them telling them hey hey make tracer gay suddenly they release a comic thats completely tertiary to the game itself for the holidays in it it reveals this character oh yeah she has a girlfriend thats all and through all of that youre still here going well jeez i hope they werent forced thats the disconnect here nothing seems remotely forced at all its their creative vision ultimately their call you second guessing that is precisely the sort of thing youre angsting over here thats why i dont get your concern it seems completely contradictory also marvels been a pretty shit company anyway so dont hold them as a metric once star wars ramps up disney will lop them off like a vestigial limb
Overwatch,removed,stfu bitch
Overwatch,removed,youre the reason lesbians turn into violent time manipulating murderers
Overwatch,removed,go back to tumblr faggot
Overwatch,removed,now many of them will drop their work and end up being upset no they fucking wont what are you five
Overwatch,removed,so tracer is mentally ill friendly reminder apa in erased homosexuality from the list of mental disorders thanks to voting many members re harrassed and threatened and no every attempt at research into it is boycotted if it is not beneficial towards sodomites lobby that is extension of leftist agenda
Overwatch,removed,you dont care about the lore of a hero you bigot the lgbt community need this or they will kill themselves like you should for your hateful comments s
Overwatch,removed,enjoy the dicks up your ass cunt luckily in my bubble salty fucks dont complain that people dont like them i got news for you buddy we hate you because youre annoying as fuck not because youre gay
Overwatch,removed,i think theyre the worst part of this comic its like watching darth vader taking a day off and mourning his past tracer being gay is great for sure but i think the comic brings too many questions many scenes like coming from nowhere and looks like they dont care to explain we still dont know about widows husband or reapers family and the talon tho its the most frustrating comic i ever read i dont even know whats the main plot of this overwatch universe now apparently all heros are not fighting each other during holidays thats it
Overwatch,removed,
Overwatch,removed,no its a very nonretarded way of looking at it
Overwatch,removed,what is tracers favorite gay bar pulse cuz her ultimate is named pulse bomb
Overwatch,removed,no it is not great that she is mentally ill
Overwatch,removed,triggered fag
Overwatch,removed,fuck this stupid ass meta and fuck blizzard im so tired of soldier and roadhogs downsyndrome ass hook that can catch a fly out of midair with ease im tired of my dumb ass team mates powering up the enemy zarya because they too are mentally ill this gameis the same boring fucking characters now and it sucks donkey dick blizzard sucks ass
Overwatch,removed,nothing but gays ew
Overwatch,removed,stop derailing my thread you fucking ass hat
Overwatch,removed,i am a sensible person if something doesnt add up it doesnt register to me i would imagine going with the vagpenis dynamic one penis goes into the pee hole of another somehow but i guess logistically it makes more sense if one just cums into the others pee hole
Overwatch,removed,fucking good if you suck you dont deserve exclusives i hope they release skins that are limited time too fuck perfectionist collectors
Overwatch,removed,kys
Overwatch,removed,asian women are disgusting mercy
Overwatch,removed,two monkeys going bananas on the court great work
Overwatch,removed,no one said anything about switching characters you down syndrome
Overwatch,removed,the change was unpopular get over it and like how does that change the fact that potgs are low effort and low quality content lol just because you and the bunch of retards that make up this reddit enjoy shit quality content doesnt make it good sorry
Overwatch,removed,seriously fuck you
Overwatch,removed,youre making no sense listen do you play mercylucio or not if you answered no to either of these questions then you can happily fuck off
Overwatch,removed,oh yeah and they say that fuck boys like u get owned usually supports usually beg to join my party all the time because i carry
Overwatch,removed,kys and no
Overwatch,removed,i wonder if anything happens when he uses his ult in a gar bar
Overwatch,removed,wow i found out how to do it with almost no effort editing soon
Overwatch,removed,please stop analyzing how balanced the game is god d youre a female and only play meidvamercy d just stop
Overwatch,removed,either a troll or has some form of autism hanzo flair does this even need to be discussed rofl
Overwatch,removed,sick
Overwatch,removed,it looks more like a jackdaw to me you ignorant slut
Overwatch,removed,yup because youre totally not a pc player idiot
Overwatch,removed,do you even know how to read its not playing pc that makes you superior its the games you play plus the advantages from mkb that makes you superior
Overwatch,removed,then go to roverwatchuniversity where discussion is the point
Overwatch,removed,roverwatchuniversity rcompetitiveoverwatch bye
Overwatch,removed,kill yourself
Overwatch,removed,seems to me the most logical solution is to not play on console
Overwatch,removed,i dotn fucking care for those console players they got their aimhelper who sometimes feels like an aimbot
Overwatch,removed,nope we wont say goodbye stop being a sjw fucktard
Overwatch,removed,well you proved you are dumb as fuck no more work needed for me
Overwatch,removed,this works so long until youre not playing against retards anymore i dont know how mmr works but after level this shit didnt work nymore
Overwatch,removed,reasoning behind this is cause blizz thinks console players are faggits and should not deserve proper implementation of certain things and you should buy yourself a pc and become pc masterrace
Overwatch,removed,rofl buying a fucking fps game on console and then whining yeah im sorry to say it but you made your bed
Overwatch,removed,lul making fps games for consoles lul
Overwatch,removed,you all are too focused on karma and not content or what the people want you just want to shove discussion down everyones throat there are already subs for overwatch discussion like roverwatchuniversity and rcompetitiveoverwatch just let this sub be what it is nobody gives a damn about karma except the mods
Overwatch,removed,they admit they only saw diversity grow in the last hours of their one week rule thats a massive failure they just keep glazing it over as some sort of proof that it worked and were all wrong yet all theyre doing is manipulating words and data there are subs already for overwatch discussion roverwatchuniversity and rcompetitiveoverwatch exist for that reason there is literally no reason for this sub to change what it is at its core and try to be something the userbase obviously doesnt want
Overwatch,removed,its not blatantly untrue even the mods admit that it was all fan art and only within the last hours of their rule did diversity happen that can be contributed to the fact that there was a patch and there was actually something to discuss if there is something to discuss then it will happen organically it doesnt need to be crammed down our throats as they seem to want there is roverwatchuniversity and rcompetitiveoverwatch already this sub doesnt need to change and completely remove what made it popular
Overwatch,removed,hey man dont let those pc gamers bring you down theyre just mad because all that dried semen on the keyboard is slowing them down
Overwatch,removed,playing the game on a console is ruining your experience ftfy
Overwatch,removed,fps games on controllers are for casual video games need to be played on a scrubs torbjorn is op on console because nobody can aim without cancerous autoaim doing of the work for you its a stationary target for christs sake if you actually want to be able to aim you should have gotten a pc fun gifs of controllers without autoaim httpsimgurcomevvjojar httpsgfycatcompointedenragedcock downvote report ban me still true
Overwatch,removed,relevant httpsimgurcomgalleryimkqb

Overwatch,removed,stop being a vaccinated fucktard and throw taht piece of garbage out the window and buy a fucking computer you fucking ugly shitter
Overwatch,removed,yeah its hard to say something with pc basement trolls jumping down your throat
Overwatch,removed,well that is what you get for being a filthy console peasant
Overwatch,removed,but leave us console players alone if all youre going to do is be completely degenerate and rude how about you stop being a delusional ignorant consumer and use pc
Overwatch,removed,

Overwatch,removed,man console kids really are dumb
Overwatch,removed,consoles in lul
Overwatch,removed,you deserve every loss for choosing to play on a potatobox zero sympathy
Overwatch,removed,to make console peasants feel better blizzard will probably nerf turrets in every version of the game and remove mouse and keyboard support
Overwatch,removed,dont be silly the mods care about karma whores more than they care about you and the console player base
Overwatch,removed,howd i know there would be an edit with this console pleb crying that the master race is superior
Overwatch,removed,all the fanboys how many dev cocks do you suck in a day

Overwatch,removed,dva is still the tankiest character in the game and one of the most mobil welp thats wrong roadhog can attest to that the only people complaining about her are the people who abused her while she was broken climbed higher than they deserve ad hominem attack with zero backing also reaper flare hmm im sure thats got nothing to do with you abusing him while he is broken climbed higher than you deserve seeing how he deals with her friends who have mained dva since release and still kick ass in diamond and blantant lie because no pros plays heranymore the meta was heroes now its you are wrong and since you like to name call and never back up shit lets point you are a retarded subhuman fucktard who should never touch this game again you are not a master rank you should not make a guide because you and youre view are lies or just stupid as fuck just like you enjoy being wrong about this forever retard the forums and pros all laugh at you fucks on reddit circle jerking how you know better but all youre ideas make the game worse and have people leaving thats all you did here shitstain now shut fuck up and let the adults talk
Overwatch,removed,tldr type in ¯ツ¯ for proper formatting actual reply for the ¯ツ¯ like you were trying for you need three backslashes so it should look like this when you type it out ¯ツ¯ which will turn out like this ¯ツ¯ the reason for this is that the underscore character this one is used to italicize words just like an asterisk does this guy since the face of the emoticon has an underscore on each side it naturally wants to italicize the face this guy ツ the backslash is reddits escape character basically a character used to say that you dont want to use a special character in order to format but rather you just want it to display so your first is just saying hey i dont want to italicize ツ so it keeps the underscore but gets rid of the backslash since its just an escape character after this you still want the arm so you have to add two more backslashes two not one since backslash is an escape character so you need an escape character for your escape character to displayconfusing i know anyways i guess thats my lesson for the day on reddit formatting lol caution probably very boring edit as to why you dont need to escape the second underscore read only if youre super bored or need to fall asleep edit the reason you only need an escape character for the first underscore and not the second is because the second underscore which doesnt have an escape character doesnt have another underscore with which to italicize reddits formatting works in that you need a special character to indicate how you want to format text then you put the text you want to format then you put the character again for example you would type italicize or italicize in order to get italicize since we put an escape character we have italicize and dont need to escape the second underscore since theres not another nonescaped underscore with which to italicize something in between them so technically you could have written ¯ツ¯ but you dont need to since theres not a second nonescaped underscore you would need to escape the second underscore if you planned on using another underscore in the same line but not if you used a line break aka pressed enter twice if you used an asterisk later though on the same line it would not work with the nonescaped underscore to italicize to show you this you can type italicize and it should not be italicized
Overwatch,removed,the autism is strong in this one
Overwatch,removed,wow is he autistic or retarded or something
Overwatch,removed,nigger you are silver
Overwatch,removed,no theres a lot of people who get how things work it just so happened all you morons came in and circlejerked the same thing maybe take the hint everyone has given you your whole life and figure out youre just stupid lmao turning off notifications stay stupid

Overwatch,removed,i do feel like a big man being literally factually better than the moronic status quo that buy in to consoles and i bet you enjoy being a sjw for people who bitch about a problem theyre responsible for helping create having done so i looked through your sorry post history you should spend less time on reddit and youre always this abrasive go to anger management or something dude youre a soccer fan so you already contribute nothing to society enjoy playing overwatch on pc with your gamepad pleb

Overwatch,removed,to pc players remember that our pc community prides itself on being gracious what the fuck no i hate this faggy community its so gay that everyone is so buttfrustrated that once in their overwatch career someone said ez after a game and now they cant sleep well at night and have to post here telling people to stop being mean as if the mean people would be ones to listen in the first place jesus fucking christ
Overwatch,removed,you can always type some text using your keyboard that is if youre not part of the whole console gaming thing
Overwatch,removed,i hope you are raped by your closest family member then left to die
Overwatch,removed,learn to play retard
Overwatch,removed,this subreddit has too many crybabies what a piece of shit this place turned out to be
Overwatch,removed,because fuck pleb ass console fags
Overwatch,removed,i cringe at every console gameplay xd
Overwatch,removed,my fucking arse youre goddamn stupid aiming is imporant in games yes aiming like in all fps games about shooting stuff but overwatch has many other mechanics than cs go health armor shields how maps are constructed turrets health pickups ults etc well youre shit at cs go sir as mccrees revolver isnt the most similar weapon to cs go csgo didnt have til quite far during its lifetime you dumass the most similar weapon from overwatch to csgo would be actually soldiers rifle if you cant get this just hit yourself with a brick and do the world a favour and i am allowed to call you a retard since im getting a science degree in biotechnology in of best unis in my country following your ideollogy just like youre allowed all this piece of bs without any thought to it or waiting a bit for the community to apply to current changes in patch i mean youre so fucking dumb you couldnt even understand mario kart vs need for speed comparison you shitbrick and then you say both are fps games i despise idiots like you you should be put down in the name of homo sapiens sapiens for your degenerative dna in human gene pool seriously on the way try hitting your parents and even better teachers as both groups seem to failed miserably at raising a being with a logical pattern of thought
Overwatch,removed,cs go isnt actually a good comparison you shithead as its mostly about patterns and recoil not the true aim like cs so eat a cock on this one oh look i dont fucking care if you played cs go either youre so stupid that you cant get sarcasm well that hasnt changed in responses has it either youre terribly ill or something i feel real sorry for yer parents now as raising such a lost cause or even breeding one is just effin shameful
Overwatch,removed,you sound like a spic the way you talk about respect lmao
Overwatch,removed,fuck you texan cunt
Overwatch,removed,hey i heard that you lied once about seeing something when your sister was in elementary school but she wasnt in elementary school she was in middle school visiting the elementary school to help out i feel as though a liar such as this should not be posting in this subreddit liars beware
Overwatch,removed,listen up i have a mystery for you to solve and outside it there are walls with when the time comes with heart
Overwatch,removed,accept youre dumb dude youre sooo trying to be smart but it does not work out for you
Overwatch,removed,we just banged ur mom four of us put it into her pussy and two others went for her mouth they would switch their dicks whenever one of them was about to cum and our hard cocks were ravaging her hole nonstop we all came together on her and it was the best experience of my life cant imagine how much she liked that
Overwatch,removed,so shit shit shit and even more shit you must suck at life bro you bitch about anything thats new or youre just plain stupid
Overwatch,removed,i cant believe youre getting downvoted for this i feel you people are fucks as others have said just block anyone who is even slightly toxic and it cant hurt to report for harassment especially if they say something as intense as kill yourself
Overwatch,removed,pasta recipe since ive never written it down before and havent calculated the amounts youll have to go with however of each thing you think fits you best anyways here goes ingerdients spaghetti lemons tomato sauce not ketchup if you want more flavor buy some spices separately not ketchup parsley minced meat optional spices like pepper or what not first spaghetti since this recipe only works as a whole were taking the advantage of water and using it to get the flavor out of parsley right here alongside the spaghetti just rip them into smaller pieces and thats it cook your spaghetti till its ready with some parsley thrown in there when its cooked youll have the advantage of parsley being already mixed in with spaghetti second sauce squeeze out lemon juice out of those lemons mix it with tomato sauce it should be tomato sauce lemon juice add the spices if you want any thats it third meat youll have to fry the minced meat dont use a lot of oil youre not deep frying it only use enough oil so it wouldnt burn when you see that the meat is just about done add around of your sauce into the pan and mix it in the meat should absorb mostall of it after this is done pour your meat into the rest of your sauce and mix it up again when serving put some meatsauce on your spaghetti and thats it for a single serving i think its about of minced meat ml of sauce and g of spaghetti i think dont know how many lemons youll need maybe dig in
Overwatch,removed,console fags hehe xd

Overwatch,removed,if anyone finds something hidden about sombra that would be great this should have our next hint
Overwatch,removed,you inspired me to look at your post history httpiimgurcomundefinedpng im sorry i picked on you i didnt realize you were mentally deficient
Overwatch,removed,extracted images so far httpimgurcomawkwxx
Overwatch,removed,get over it sensitive cuck there is no such thing as cultural appropriation you are just a thin skinned spineless mangina who subscribes to a fantasy victim narrative
Overwatch,removed,ucouldbealien provided us with what looks to be an account name or at least an email address amandahoodbellsouthnet
Overwatch,removed,currently trying to see the email on httpswebchatfreenodenet sombra now cant be certain but it looks something like amandahoodbellsouthnet
Overwatch,removed,im about sure the first part is amandahood

Overwatch,removed,found this httpspamreportemailbahoodbellsouthnet it may be another email address related do amanda hood bahoodbellsouthnet
Overwatch,removed,so if you click no guest posts httpsangryaltwordpresscomguestposts there is this entry the masks we wear – nov on wtfcraftcom mssks you say puts on detective hat ok nvm wtfcraftcom doesnt seem to be active in fact red herring
Overwatch,removed,i dont know about that the blog poster has his email listed as angryaltgmailcom instead of amandahood his name also seems to be rajis he hasnt posted since either and the chances that someone who downloaded the pdf images was looking at this blog completely out of chance over years after it would even be relevant is small
Overwatch,removed,maybe blizzard totaly fucked up and this screenshot is not hint at all i mean the image is very old and the blog httpsangryaltwordpresscom where the screenshot comes from looks dead
Overwatch,removed,they probably took it down because of the personal information policy without confirmation that this is part of the arg the mods have to assume were destroying amanda hoods email for no reason
Overwatch,removed,this blog is actually from as are the photos
Overwatch,removed,this guy is a troll i found a
Overwatch,removed,i sent a battlenet friend request to the email address amandahoodbellsouthnet i will update if anything happens
Overwatch,removed,poor amanda hood her inbox might never recover
Overwatch,removed,i didnt see anyone posting the obligatory response here so go kill yourself d d d
Overwatch,removed,on that persons blog they offer their email to be contacted by which doesnt match up to the email people have found in the image angryaltgmailcom
Overwatch,removed,the hint said it was going to get harder perhaps this is another red herring to throw us off the trail keep emailing her kidding please dont do that
Overwatch,removed,lol keep playing your nintendo
Overwatch,removed,dont get mad peasant 😏
Overwatch,removed,poor amanda as someone who is itching for a good arg i can vouch for those emails definitely being in the thousands

Overwatch,removed,ehm you were wrong about the jackdaw thing so why would we believe you now lol
Overwatch,removed,will your new moderators do anything about people taking credit for another persons ideas the guy was gilded and got upvotes for restating my idea is this allowed on this subreddit
Overwatch,removed,heres the thing
Overwatch,removed,j a c k d a w s
Overwatch,removed,burn down the subreddit
Overwatch,removed,rekt
Overwatch,removed,outed
Overwatch,removed,his reply is pretty amusing
Overwatch,removed,
Overwatch,removed,qyb here we come
Overwatch,removed,there has been a lot of speculation on zenyatta recently and their ideas arent exactly the same it could be coincidence
Overwatch,removed,for shame op
Overwatch,removed,cant the guy just have the same idea i assume we can all think its not a pioneering idea to have those circling balls around him act as a shield thats the first thing that popped into my mind too when i saw he didnt use them as one
Overwatch,removed,thats an energy shield very different from what was suggested there even if similar in design the other post also focused on the specifics while this post focused on the idea if devs ever made a change in the game it would be based on an idea not numbers so that leaves us to the conclusion which is that the original post is similar has a worse design focuses on completely useless things mostly and this post can be boiled down to sentence and as an idea it might be similar but as a design its different
Overwatch,removed,angry at op want to join the mob ive got you covered come on down to rpitchforkemporium i got em all traditionalleft handedfancy eǝ i even have discounted clearance forks offmanufacturers defect fle new in stock directly from liechtenstein european models the eurothe poundthe lira €£₤ happy lynching some assembly required
Overwatch,removed,
Overwatch,removed,is an idea stealing phony
Overwatch,removed,im dubious of this assertion while i agree that its unlikely to be a coincidence this isnt the precise same idea the link you posted is talking about reducing his max ammo the op here is talking about consuming his ammo at a high rate your link seems to imply that you just sacrifice ammo and generically get a shield but the op here is implying that youre consuming ammo while the ability is activated to deflect attacks its possibly an idea inspired by what you linked and the source was unattributed but its hardly the same idea and even though its super unlikely nothing says that the guy in that thread you linked is the first person to think of this mention it or post it and its not impossible that our op had the idea organically on his own or heard it somewhere and improved on it and came here to post it without ever seeing that post i guess what im saying is i think stickying this assertion made by someone outside reddit when it cant be substantiated is pretty close to witchhunting if the guy has a beef he can come and post here about it himself imo
Overwatch,removed,how is this idea taken from that thread a deflect is different from a reflect and that is also different from an energy shield which is different from a zahrya style shield a deflect would be a brief period of invincibility against projectile attacks it probably wouldnt work against beams bombs or sprays zahrya junkrat or mei
Overwatch,removed,kys
Overwatch,removed,what ive seen a dozen variants of this idea here and on rcompetitiveoverwatch
Overwatch,removed,achievement fags lul go play wow or something
Overwatch,removed,well this is weird it seems i have no possible way to defend myself if somebody had a similar idea and claims i stole it theirs i understand the users frustration if he seems to think i took his idea but to me the only parts that were similar were the idea of an on demand defense based on ammo usage thats where the similarities stopped im amused that this was stickied but i guess this is the home of lynch mobs so i should have expected such
Overwatch,removed,to be fair this is an idea i have heard tossed around quite often lately bar the expending ammunition part of the idea though
Overwatch,removed,some on reddit stole my suggestion and it got upvoted times welcome to life kid
Overwatch,removed,why is a moderator inciting a witch hunt from a possbily taken idea from a different medium on a different site with different users and different discussions theres zero reason a mod flair or a sticky was needed for this post
Overwatch,removed,lmao yeah because coincidences are impossible better incite a witch hunt you have a big future over at rbadmoderators
Overwatch,removed,confused as to why this mod decided to sticky a post attacking op you dont deserve mod if you are going to sticky a claim that he stole an idea solely based on the fact that they are similar there are thousands of zenyatta suggestions did they all steal each others
Overwatch,removed,is the idea that similar that you need to incite a witch hunt there are literally no similarities aside from a replacement ult fire that is defensive in nature
Overwatch,removed,there are so many million plus players on overwatch there are hundreds of thousands on the reddit and even more total with the ow forum there are so many people that couldve thought of this idea and they dont even seen that similar to assume and accuse someone of stealing an idea and starting this hate was stupid and a poor sad job as moderator
Overwatch,removed,good to see moderation is shitstirring garbage here in this sub
Overwatch,removed,i saw the idea here as i dont browse the ow forums but having read the ow posters idea they are significantly different the only tie in is replacing the right click which has been suggested before by others implying which you do as a mod by posting and sticking this comment that the idea was or could be stolen is dramainciting and imo poor moderation please continue to strive for good moderation but avoid moments like these in the future and take time to think through potential impacts like this this comment being stickied to the top makes the reddit ow community seem more toxic and anticommunity than i believe is intended
Overwatch,removed,this mods all like my opinion should be a sticky and everyone should see my opinion first because im a moderator on reddit
Overwatch,removed,by parenthesizing possibly you heavily suggest that this post was stolen from the thread as a mod its disappointing that you would comment this and risk or cause as it turns out a witchhunt your post lacks the professionalism with which it could have been written to state that the ideas were similar
Overwatch,removed,who stickies and incites a witch hunt as a mod are you an idiot
Overwatch,removed,god i hate you people
Overwatch,removed,͡° ͜ʖ ͡°
Overwatch,removed,nigga please have you even experienced fps dark souls its a rhetorical questions clearly not you fucking peasant

Overwatch,removed,im the roadhog in the enemy team i created this account just to say that this wasnt a glitch or an exploit it was straight up hacks the mccree on our team was constantly spamming the chat with buy now name of hack is off at website this wasnt exactly what he said but it was something like that and proceeded to what seemed to be noclipping through the entire map and you could see him literally go from one place to another in seconds when i was dead i saw him under the point most of the time and im surprised you didnt get him on tape since he peeked his head through sometimes to kill people and he was saying on voice chat maps are so bad because they dont allow you to shoot through walls or something tldr mccree on our team was cheating and this wasnt a bug
Overwatch,removed,fapass pedos in this stupid subreddit you will go nowhere in life

Overwatch,removed,generally you dont offend its the other guy that gets offended take a look at feminazis they hear what they want to hear and get offended where no offense was meant
Overwatch,removed,did you not read anything i said or are you just too busy deepthroating blizzards cock to bother with reading comprehension
Overwatch,removed,are you gay
Overwatch,removed,its like you dumbshits cant even read and the best of all have never played quick play if you tell others to go play competitive because they want to take the game seriously its time to stop

Overwatch,removed,the complaint often boils down to mercy is really unfun in solo queue and zenyatta dies way too easily which pidgeonholes support players into lucio no it fucking doesnt solo queue healing is a thankless chore where no matter how great you heal your team can still fuck it up for you and there is nothing you can do about it it is nowhere near as fun to play versus the tank or even better the dps classes and that is clearly evidenced by the fact that few volunteer and as time progresses even those few do so begrudgingly mercy is fine and fun to play so is zenyatta and lucio symmetra is as well while we are at it because lucio is more effective for the group as a whole doesnt make playing support suck and fuck you for saying it

Overwatch,removed,now that all the widow hate is finally reaching the front page i can say in fill confidence suck the fattest part of my cock buddy your nerdy wet dream of playing op as dicks widowmaker is coming to an end at last
Overwatch,removed,your use of developed vocabulary in many contradictory statements provide nothing to my suggested changes list your word choice is poor at best and only serves to piss others off telling me to contemplate my life choices from creating a requested overwatch changes thread just shows your stupidity afterall you were here to read it as well werent you kys
Overwatch,removed,go to rcompetitiveoverwatch or roverwatchuniversity then the people on the defaults dont tend to give good discussions anyway at least not on launch
Overwatch,removed,mercy on my face please ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°
Overwatch,removed,havent browsed it much myself so it may not be what youre looking for but rcompetitiveoverwatch is more serious than this subreddit is
Overwatch,removed,very well then besides actually giving feedback youd rather be a fucking nigger about it in what way is this a shitpost
Overwatch,removed,i could say kill yourself you retarded moron in my own living room and it would have impact on you mute accomplishes exactly that
Overwatch,removed,nobody gives a fuck about what u wish actually
Overwatch,removed,foreign accents are considered racist i knew europoors were stupid i just didnt know they were retarded
Overwatch,removed,this is my comment on how to nerf her

Overwatch,removed,sigh how do the same retards end up moderating so many large subs this idea is dumb as fuck and is clearly the result of someone on a powertrip with not enough to do
Overwatch,removed,if u gonna be such a pussy then plz unplug urself from the web its a game and emotions tend to run high people tend to play games to decompress but sometimes shit adds up and we all slip up once in a while also nothing wrong with a bit of dark sense of humor gezzuz christ some people are not made to be in some placez
Overwatch,removed,cockfags they genji main always because were cockfag noobs
Overwatch,removed,because youre a selfish little shit
Overwatch,removed,probably best not to make a post like this when you clearly have no idea what youre talking about just makes you look like a complete fuckwit
Overwatch,removed,please just kys
Overwatch,removed,glad to hear an opinion of a dense as fuck individual
Overwatch,removed,lol my main argument is everyones complaints arent valid there are ways to counter widow plain and simple your only argument is the masses have the same complaint so numbers validity the huge amount of people supporting donald ttump mean their point of view is correct then right and everyone else is an idiot its the same argument numbers dont equal validity if you could have an argument that doesnt reference number or the jews of pros who are in a league well above any of ours please do your arguments are shit and you claiming mine hold no water is laughable
Overwatch,removed,yeah you are clueless and a fine representation of the dumpster playerbase as evidenced by pretty much the obliviousness of that entire comment and i dont know why you mention trash like cod just to put in some moronic meme drivel in your comment but thats okay i shouldnt expect ow to be anything more than a casual fun minigame
Overwatch,removed,you legit need to fuck off and die
Overwatch,removed,yea youre retarded if you want the front page to be stupid potgs im sorry if we expect to be able to discuss the meta of the game and not see some shitty junk rat kills all the time have fun being shit at the game and never getting better because they dont allow discussion on this shifty subreddit

Overwatch,removed,httplmgtfycomqoverwatchcompetitiverewards
Overwatch,removed,lol youre an idiot its hilarious how mad you get when the truth is stated of course cheaters are a problem in every game not to the extent of csgo where matchmaking there has multiple cheaters every single game of nonprime and most games of prime you have to pay for a subscription based service from a third party company esea to play with the least amount of cheaters and people still cheat on there the video i provided there holds plenty of facts by itself youre such a completely oblivious moron that no matter what i say youll just disagree out of pure willingness to be stubborn there are not plenty of strange looking clips from overwatch not nearly as many as compared to csgo

Overwatch,removed,i play overwatch on the with my uncle who has alzheimers his arthritis combined with his epilepsy causes him to have frequent seizures so he doesnt have the dexterity to play on pc it saddens me that you think of analog stick console users as a joke because you know what my uncle is the best damn winston youve ever seen due to his ongoing gambling addiction the rest of the family cut off from him long ago and his wife sadly passed away last year i am the only one he speaks to and we really connect when we play overwatch sure it might not be as pro as the pc version but we have fun and its that what its all about nothing wrong with panicking because analog sticks man uncle craig cant play dva because her boosters trigger his ptsd from when he was flying the bell xtdl airacobra fighter plane in world war he hasnt been the same ever since but to each their own i guess
Overwatch,removed,maybe youd like it if i repeated that joke to my disabled wife no i thought not she was born a paraplegic and has led such a brave life so far shes highly intelligent and can only communicate by blinking morse code and yet despite all that shes still as beautiful as the day i met her we were childhood sweethearts met when we were in middle school and as soon as our eyes crossed paths shes crosseyed i knew that she was the one people have been tough to us over the years and i stood by her through thick and thin because i know that she doesnt deserve this crusade of abuse she might forget about the hurtful things people say about her mainly because of her dementia but i wont show some consideration before trying to be cool with your gamer friends

Overwatch,removed,lol good for you and the other retards im actually going to keep complaining about it but thanks for your useless opinion
Overwatch,removed,are you serious instead of deleting his misleading comment you say that theres alleged brigade but the truth is that hes completely wrong and people are pointing out his bullshit if he was spreading misinformation about blizzard it would be instantly removed yet attacking a person is perfectly okay

Overwatch,removed,translated go back to lol you fucking retards
Overwatch,removed,i found nonsupporting blizzard ie you to be fucking retarded and think you are forced to buy boxes who the fuck is forcing you to do anything you have weeks weeks days to get whatever youre trying to get now if you a casual players hours a day you should be able to pull in levels a day now you do that for days you come out ot have or summer loot boxes thats more than enough to have a fair balance chance at getting we the fuck you think you need to spend money on to get now if youre a hardcore no lifer or close to leve you can easily pull in boxes in the day timeframe which is also more than enough to have a fair and balanced chance at getting what you want stop complaning and fucking play the game and see how the even plays out

Overwatch,removed,stop posting bullshit honestly its tiresome you could pick one of the hundreds of other threads to continue to praise oh almighty blizzard we dont need another oh and to respond to your point youre fucking wrong not one person has said they want everything every fucking dissenter thinks this no one is acting entitled everyone simply wants it to not be so fucking punishing to get duplicates or to make it so ungodly difficult to get the one item they want not everything you are the problem here not the people actively voicing their concerns over the event
Overwatch,removed,your argument still makes no fucking sense in fact you added to what i was saying nobody is asking you to click on a thread yet you do because you obviously feel the need to assert yourself on the internet oh the irony in saying that im the one on a high horse
Overwatch,removed,
Overwatch,removed,videos in this thread videocomment yeah ive learned to alternate between overwatch matches and minutes of star trekcleaning the house to keep myself level and its been real helpful edit also these i like the insight about feeling embarrassed in real life because you see reactions but not having that same deterrent online it reminds me of what louis ck said on conan a few years ago a lot take your anger as an example you become angry you vent that anger in your case you often vented it to others most of them reflect those emotions back to you in one form or another fueling the fire as the anger takes over your mind it b sometimes when you get very very angry you actually can enjoy that sensation its like a drug this helped me learn to not to be an asshole in pvp games its only game why you have to be mad im a bot working hard to help redditors find related videos to watch httpsnpredditcomrsubtletvwikimentionedvideos get it on httpschromegooglecomwebstoredetailmentionedvideosforreddfiimkmdalmgffhibfdjnhljpnigcmohf httpsaddonsmozillaorgenusfirefoxaddonmentionedvideosforreddit

Overwatch,removed,riddle me this why would someone pay for the privilege of simply looking at a picture of a year old girl answer to make connections with fellow offenders for the purpose of engaging in illegal activity offsite why would a website need that massive disclosure unless it was to attempt to head off issues google image search of that name makes it damn clear where the rest of the photo shoots are heading sure they dont focus on genitals and the children are depicted in not unnatural poses with the focus on feet or a look of longing that would made a dead man uncomfortable aint no one signing up for this because theyre appreciating the backgrounds in the photos man is it legal sure in the sense that the authorities probably cant bring a successful action against the website owners themselves however its also legal for the authorities to use visitation of this website as an excuse to take other action for them to sign up for the site under false pretenses to find evidence and so on
Overwatch,removed,id smash his face not complain about it on reddit

Overwatch,removed,assuming the team knows about team chat and isnt opting to turn it on when theyre playing with you theyre clearly enjoying competitive mode enough to keep playing without letting you in on it why should their fun be subject to your sensibilities are you mentally handicapped because its called competitive for a reason if they want fun go play quick play like the rest of us the only fun to be had in competitive is finally reaching that new rank tier the premade i go with even if were down a person because theyre offline or theyre busy even if we have five we still go ahead and enable team chat why because were not dicks like you
Overwatch,removed,i agree we as a society seriously need to do something about the way young women talk nowadays like nails on a chalkboard

Overwatch,removed,yeah riots bad nonviolent protest good heres how to make it effective what everyone needs to know about nonviolent protest now with new stuff nonviolent protest is not simply a protest in which protesters dont physically aggress that is lack of violence is necessary but not sufficient for nonviolent protest nonviolent protest must be provocative if nobody cares nobody will respond gandhi didnt do boring things he took what after rigorous self examination he determined was rightfully his such as salt from the beaches of his own country and interrupted the british economy and provoked a violent response against himself must be certain not to justify the violent reactions they receive it cannot succeed without rigorous selfexamination to make sure you the protester are not committing injustice hurts like all fighting hurts you will not deal blows but you will receive them from the movie gandhi demands respect by demonstrating respectability the courage to get hit and keep coming back while offering no retaliation is one of the few things that can really make a man go huh how about that does not depend on the what the enemy does in order to be successful it depends on the commitment to nonviolence a lack of violence is not necessarily nonviolent protest nonviolence is a philosophy not a description of affairs and in order for it to work it must be understood and practiced since martin luther king few americans have done either blm included i suspect part of the reason the authorities often encourage nonviolent protest is that so few citizens know what it really entails both nonprovocative nonviolent protests and violent protests allow injustice to continue the civil rights protests of the were so effective because of the stark contrast between the innocence of the protesters and the brutality of the state that is what all nonviolent protest depends upon the assumption that their oppressors will not change their behavior and will thus sow their own downfall if one does not resist protesters must turn up the heat against themselves while doing nothing unjust though perhaps illegal and receiving the blows from the movie gandhi for example how to end zero tolerance policies at schools if youre an innocent party in a fight refuse to honor the punishment this will make them punish you more but they will have to provide an explanation because he was attacked or stood up for someone who was being attacked etc continue to not honor punishments refuse to acknowledge them if youre suspended go to school make them take action against you in the meantime do absolutely nothing objectionable the worse they punish you for literally doing nothing the more ridiculous they will seem they will have to raise the stakes to ridiculous heights handing out greater and greater punishments and ultimately it will come down to because he didnt obey a punishment he didnt deserve the crazier the punishments they hand down the more attention it will get and the more support you will get and the more bad press the administration will get until it is forced to hand out a proper ruling step disobey unjust punishments laws step be absolutely harmless polite and ruleabiding otherwise step repeat until media sensation this is exactly what gandhi and mlk did more or less nonviolent protests are a lot more than declining to aggress theyre active provocative and bring shit down on your head this is how things get changed part it is worth mentioning that this is a basic introduction to clear up common misconceptions its purpose is to show at a very basic level how nonviolent protest relies on psychological principles including our innate human dignity to create a context whereby unjust actions by authorities serve the purposes of the nonviolent actors notice how bernie sanders is campaigning the concept of nonviolence as it was conceived by gandhi called satyagraha clinging to truth goes far deeper and requires extraordinary thoughtfulness and sensitivity to nuance it is even an affirmation of love an effort to melt the heart of an oppressor but now that youre here id like to go into a bit more detail and share some resources nonviolence is not merely an absence of violence but a presence of responsibility it is necessary to take responsibility for all possible legitimate motivations of violence in your oppressor when you have taken responsibility even your oppressor would not have had you take but which is indeed yours for the taking you become seen as an innocent and the absurdity of beating down on you is made to stand naked to practice nonviolence involves not only the decision not to deal blows but to proactively pick up and carry any aspects of your own behavior that could motivate someone to be violent toward you or anyone else explicitly or implicitly nonviolence thus extends fractally down into the minutest details of life from refusing to fight back during a protest to admitting every potential flaw in an argument you are presenting to scrubbing the stove perfectly clean so that your wife doesnt get upset in the practice of nonviolence one discovers the infinitebutnotendless responsibility that one can take for the world and for the actions of others the solution to worldimprovement is virtually always selfimprovement for more information here are some links i highly recommend working definition of nonviolence httpmettacenterorgnonviolenceintroduction satyagraha wikipedia httpsenmwikipediaorgwikisatyagraha synopsis of scientific study of the effectiveness of nonviolent vs violent resistance movements over time httpncronlineorgblogsroadpeacefactsarenonviolentresistanceworks free excellent ebooks on nonviolent protest and civil disobedience httpwwwaeinsteinorgfreeresourcesfreepublicationsenglish if you read one thing read this httpsaeoncoessaysnonviolencehasreturnedfromobscuritytobecomeanewforce and of course rnonviolence what happens next what happens next depends on a case by case basis what the protesters are trying to achieve generally the process looks something like this have a clear set of concrete measurable and just demands and protest nonviolently until the establishment agrees to meet them demands need to be specific and have limits that is they cant be improve x forever there needs to be a way to decide together at a future time whether they have concretely been met and if not start protesting again demands cannot percolate into a whole set of new ones as soon as you have the upper hand its unjust to demand a minimum wage of an hour while protesting and then when the government is cornered by embarrassment and just wants this to stop to demand a minimum wage of an hour and free tomatoes for everyone demands must be just note that unjust demands will not work by principle it would be unjust coercive violent to use the spirit of nonviolence to try to extract a concession that would be damaging humiliating or otherwise destructive to the state or to other groups of people the mechanism that nonviolent protest relies on for its effectiveness the moral high ground would not be able to bear the contradiction of pursuing unjust demands the point of nonviolent protest is to create a harmonious new relationship with the former oppressor so to be able to work with them see their point of view and have a plan that acknowledges their capabilities and limitations is essential furthermore it is infinitely better if demands are for something rather than against something for example make and enforce a new police accountability law that accomplishes x y and z rather than stop letting police get away with murder the reasons for this are multiple first being for something gives everyone involved and society at large a specific target to aim at it presents a vision and puts it in public consciousness this helps to coordinate action and make that shared specific vision real by contrast being against something leaves open the decision of what to do instead the government could well pull a captain barbosa and say i promised id let you go it was you who failed to specify when or where second being for something automatically implies that the absence of that thing is a mistake in other words forness has within it what againstness was trying to achieve dont do x if youre for make and enforce a new police accountability law that accomplishes x y and z then not doing that or arguing against that will look like a failure just as much as if youd said dont do p and they went ahead and did p i know reddit hates mother teresa but she was very wise she said i would not attend an antiwar rally i would attend a propeace rally it is interesting to note how positivity and negativity interpenetrate positivity accounts for negativity within it but negativity does not account for positivity within it this seems to be what led one famous philosopher st augustine to say evil is that aspect of good which if it were all there was there would be nothing please help get this info out there it is important all of of this and more is written up at httpprotestfyi an easy

Overwatch,removed,poo will be placed in loo
Overwatch,removed,ah yes its you again the guy who thinks mercy is an attack hero listen youre definitely a good mercy but there are times in this video when you stop healing people in order to get a kill you need to play the game with this priority anyone who needs it boost those who are fighting only if nobody is around for you to damage boost your damage boost is almost always better than using your pistol watching your videos makes me think that you play with oh man the reddit will love watching me kill this guy in mind thats not how it works you need to accept that you play support youre not the star of the show and you wont get appreciated for doing a good job you seem to know this as youve begun playing poorly in order to get karma and views which isnt a good thing for your team sure its satisfying to get those pistol kills sometimes but isnt it so much more satisfying to keep everyone alive and rack up those assists tldr i think you need to reprioritize helping your team over getting flashy kills you play mercy not tracer sincerely someone who knows what hours of mercy looks like and for some reason it looks better than this
Overwatch,removed,this way is just not being a lecherous creep maybe if you grew up cleaned the dorito dust off your fingers left the confines of your mothers basement maybe talked to a woman your ass wouldnt be so twisted back around to think being a fucking creep is acceptable you fucking creep
Overwatch,removed,no its cool i mean i know youre not smart enough to actually try argue how being a fucking lecherous creep is somehow acceptable but i didnt think me calling you one would get you so huffy youd start to threaten my life way to blow things out of proportion creep

Overwatch,removed,this proves youre not equiped to even begin to think about possibly trying to argue with me even if youre going to be the pissy brat that gets that hung up on semantics to distract from the matter at hand at the end of the day theres nothing wrong with the semantics there youd know that if you maybe cracked a book instead of fapping it to video games like the sad sack of shit you are
Overwatch,removed,i accept your concession fuckface
Overwatch,removed,to be fair if illegal aliens were to attack london they would probably speak arabic
Overwatch,removed,anyone see the glitch of stationary shield anyone knows how to do that it happens to mee too but idk how i did it sorry caps
Overwatch,removed,and yet you felt the urge to dig this far down dont feign apathy you piece of shit it just makes it more apparent that you ran out of pertinent shit to say in which case you should probably just run along junior
Overwatch,removed,how sad are you that you go into every other clip post and project a shitty and elitist attitude this isnt rcompetitiveoverwatch nobody gives a fuck what your experience or rank is or what you think is good or bad remove the stick from your ass and get off your soapbox here you are days ago saying youre level and bitching about quickplay pretty hilarious
Overwatch,removed,you dont tell anyone you lvled that up you fckn fggt
Overwatch,removed,soif you are level and you are doing your placement matches for ranked well you can fuck off and die d you hardly have enough experience and the people you play with are way more experienced than you are so you are fucking up a win for the team each time you play mfckr this is why in my placements in both season ive been put in the lowest fucking ranking possible because of leavers or just players who dont know shitlike you so fuck off and learn the game first before you intend to fuck someones rank up my response to you scrub when will you learn that your actions have consequences here is my idea if blizzard would ever read this bring up the max level allowed to play competitive to plz or fuck off all together brainsinoverwatchareararespecimenindeed

Overwatch,removed,although his spin is quite smooth why does the aimbot react so late after the first kill he clearly needs time to think where you are then he flicks around and aims for either one of you he luckily hits every shot thats all his predictions where very spot on def not an aimbot
Overwatch,removed,work the owls with your hands then lick and suckle on the bees bite em a little bit but not too hard then kiss your way down her fat donkey and gently tongue the starfish until you hear purring now the cat is fully primed and ready for your attention if the whiskers bother you too much politely suggest that she wax the clam so you can more easily find the pearl watch out for crabs geez i hope i wasnt too subtle 😓

Overwatch,removed,yeah that happens to me on a daily basis me and the gf got a situation rn where she has a fetish for me walking around in my underwear with a boner but the only way i can keep a boner up is if shes around the house doing chores so i watch from the kitchen window while she takes out the trash and i stand in front of the window wearing nothing but my underwear with a rageing hard on then she comes back in the house and i grab her and carry her gingerly up to the bedroom and suplex her down on the bed and then she uses her teeth to rip off my underwear then i fall down like leaning tower of pisa into her fuckin pussy flaps and hump her hard core that pussy hits the spot slowly increase intensity till im jackhammering her in a nice little place i like to call pound town as she screams and has multiple orgasms then i flip her over and shove my mushroom tip into that sweet balloon knot of a butthole just piledriveing that ass as i bring my rod in and out i see more and more speckles of dookie on my massive cock until i pull out and spray a load of cum all over her back and then examine my hand theres blood poop and cum on it i make her lick it off then we high five and order papa johns

Overwatch,removed,hmmmm good very good ending looks familiar though
Overwatch,removed,lol riiiiiight
Overwatch,removed,do you want me to carefully explain what the word petition means and how it doesnt appear anywhere in this fucking post or should i poorly draw an image in microsoft paint showing the differences between a petition and this post your choice i personally think the second option would be best for you as i dont think your brain can actually comprehend the first explanation
Overwatch,removed,aaaaannnnnnnndddddddd here we get the basic blizzard asperger who just likes to have fun buy playing dps in competitive game mode jackpot
Overwatch,removed,retard this autistic kid is saying why cant i play heroes i cant play for fun in ranked this is just what i am complaining about the community
Overwatch,removed,yep you are damn right only kids and autistic manchilds use reddit
Overwatch,removed,ive explained simple things like this to idiots like you many times before and ive learned my lesson degenerates dont comprehend facts if youre really eager to figure out why youre an idiot go look up what a petition is
Overwatch,removed,i see you still havent looked up what a petition is since this is apparently too complex for a simple person like you to grasp on your own ill spoon feed it to you we need people to not use petitions as their default i want this random feature request because they soon become associated as exactly that random feature requests avoiding the use of the word petition for insignificant things like that takes that subconscious association away so that blizzard employees dont glance over petition posts without fully acknowledging what the petition is for with that problem over with having people use hey blizzard is appropriate since the casual connotation with hey fits with insignificant requests which then causes no blur between relevant and irrelevant requests but of course despite me spoon feeding this to you youre probably too arrogant to accept the facts and will probably continue acting like a fucking twat am i right with that assumption or do you understand now
Overwatch,removed,
Overwatch,removed,do you have nothing else to do your flair and recent posts constantly suck that genji cock and youre extremely in denial that he is in fact overpowered no dash reset would fix a lot of bullshit the jump cooldown is fair too because if genji can stay in the air longer than a hero who basically has a fucking jetpack then you know somethings wrong well you dont because youre a blind genji main which by itself is a very stupid thing having mains you onetrick pony ho wants to feel like a super pro when there genji is literally the scout in you dont need to be super skilled as is the common train of thought of people like you you just need to know that you must spam lmb and space
Overwatch,removed,the server crashed you dipshit
Overwatch,removed,only noob tube fags play junkrat
Overwatch,removed,nah im doing juuust fine partner now clinging to a fleeting crutch at all costs to get by thats just pathetic hey i get it if you can barely manage with genju now its going to be a bitch to play when hes not broken i might be tempted to put blinders on and go scream at everybody too
Overwatch,removed,too autistic for jokes there thats great now tell me every other alt in the game requires another alt to counter it hint they dont lol
Overwatch,removed,lmao youre probably like rank at the highest you literally know zero dog shit about this game kid see me im a fucking asshole and youre a pretty boy if you wanna be good at ow you have to be a god damn prick and stick your fat cock inside the asses of your enemy no matter if they make racks a day or do it for free good luck to you and your rank brotha
Overwatch,removed,draws a pig on her stomach probably gets mad when someone calls her a pig irl
Overwatch,removed,god damn thats disgusting
Overwatch,removed,they should nerf her diet
Overwatch,removed,wow something a slob can actually cosplay as gross but good
Overwatch,removed,excuse me i identify as an attack helicopter respect my identity you fucking cis scum
Overwatch,removed,its like that so you dont have to see her cottage cheese belly rolls
Overwatch,removed,my eyes hurt
Overwatch,removed,she is a fat hag look at her arms absolutely disgusting
Overwatch,removed,i misread the fan content tag as fat content
Overwatch,removed,overwatch the game where being a fat fuck is encouraged this is either some real hardcore method acting or a lucky coincidence eitherway its sad
Overwatch,removed,no shed require actual willpower to work out and fatties cant muster that
Overwatch,removed,well first i was just pissed because we were in the last round and the dude left prompting my post but you seem like a cunt so fuck you and i hate when the other team leaves because you just have to play a round or two while the others leave and its boring and shitty then you have to spend the next minutes loading and finding a game and getting into a shit skirmish just so you either gets kids with no thumbs or more leaving cunts often these two are the same
Overwatch,removed,gross
Overwatch,removed,massive kek
Overwatch,removed,neat the perfect cosplay for all the feminists out there
Overwatch,removed,gross
Overwatch,removed,i dont like fat people
Overwatch,removed,i mean i guess its effective if they sit on you
Overwatch,removed,probably because no one wants to see her gross flabby stomach
Overwatch,removed,great cosplay shudders
Overwatch,removed,disgusting yet accurate at the same time
Overwatch,removed,fat people ruin everything
Overwatch,removed,more like ill hook em and eat themall
Overwatch,removed,what a grotesque abomination of a human people this fat need to be put down
Overwatch,removed,barfs
Overwatch,removed,nah just have that reaction when a that looks sticky to the touch bet she smells like salty garbage
Overwatch,removed,celebrating obesity hooray
Overwatch,removed,i vomitted inside my mouth i hate fat people so gross and sweaty and disgusting ohh wait thats the perfect girly roadhog cosplay
Overwatch,removed,tbf i doubt anyones penis is feeling anything in regards ot that cosplay lol
Overwatch,removed,roadhog is cute because hes an animated character morbidly obese people are not irl this is fucking gross
Overwatch,removed,repulsive tbh
Overwatch,removed,fuck thats disqusting

Overwatch,removed,take a breather is an insulin inhaler

Overwatch,removed,logged on to comment fat cow
Overwatch,removed,actually nauseating she looks like she smells awful
Overwatch,removed,cosplay doesnt exist just to show off tits you fucking retard jessica nigri is a cancer in the cosplay community
Overwatch,removed,i guess thats one pro to being a fat disgusting slob
Overwatch,removed,thats nasty why
Overwatch,removed,i like how there is a pig on her stomach it lets everyone know that she is a pig
Overwatch,removed,i dont need an md to tell you this bitch is going to have the beetus soon enough i dont really care if shes healthy or not though just thats shes aesthetically awful and just another byproduct of our hedonistic consumerist culture
Overwatch,removed,you are a terrible teammate fuck you
Overwatch,removed,yea i just looked up her master skin and came across this picture
Overwatch,removed,i posted a link but no one else seems to be able to see it
Overwatch,removed,a aim precision hero who deals around damage per grenade aoe is good at all ranges because of his shift ability has a trap and a one shot hero comboall he has to do is land one grenade even if you dodge he will kill you if he lands one grenade with is combo now the only time he is vulnerable the only time you can actually counter him they buff his ult and now you want more go suck a fucking cock

Overwatch,removed,anyone with brains would realize thats the perfect time to reveal her you know when she confirms shes actually do something personally rather than make cryptic hints you do ignore a lot of the arg and you being too stupid not to realize that does mean my tiny brain comment was correct very good job trying to sound smart in order to somehow prove your point though at least its good to see you can do that

Overwatch,removed,sry but u are dumb as a doorknob your core content that actually fking matterseg heroesmaps is free and handed to you on release the cosmetic shit lootboxesskins is still fking free if u level up or u can pay for itbut that doesnt affect your gameplay so who gives a fuck plus if ur parents taught you how to readit says buy or earn the new lootboxes so stop shitposting u retard
Overwatch,removed,holy shit the retards in this thread
Overwatch,removed,except in that case those were items that affected gameplay these are just cosmetic items youre being a crybaby
Overwatch,removed,yes i am against it it simply encourages the garbage tier mainers in overwatch to continue playing only one character you know at least half the people crying are people who just main one or two characters and want a way to just get the items for those characters well fuck those people
Overwatch,removed,i am totally down with making it coins as long as the time limit stays mainly to hear even more crying from the manchildren on this sub
Overwatch,removed,but at that age a hole is a hole and you stop caring that its your stepdaughter
Overwatch,removed,soooo wave feminists the current generation of liberal arts college students and blm d
Overwatch,removed,so ok hol up you claim you want a system to literally force players who you deem not good to not be allowed to play their chosen character and youre calling me toxic you are such a retard its not even funny can we downvote you off of this sub
Overwatch,removed,the irony is that hackers drink your tears all day long you get to enjoy it when some of the more autistic ones whine about getting the hammer the rest come back and continue to rape your tears out of you p
Overwatch,removed,httpwwwownedcorecom here is the site they use
Overwatch,removed,im gonna buy a lootbox for every crybay cmplaint in this topic we have enough problems with people maining heroes in this game last thing we need is to encourage people to continue this by allowing them to get all the cosmetic items they want for one specific hero
Overwatch,removed,stfu faggot
Overwatch,removed,spot the steroid russian who cant take a fucking joke
Overwatch,removed,shut the fuck up you stupid crybaby you fucking people are will whine about anything
Overwatch,removed,as always reddit is an echo chamber of infantile retards most players will see it as a blessing that blizzard is adding new seasonal content patching a game that theyre under no obligation to do

Overwatch,removed,and based on your post history you seem like a highly intelligent human being worth having a civil discussion with wait just kidding
Overwatch,removed,lol thats so weird because i am playing overwatch on console and currently at a skill ranking of it has been a long ride to climb my way from the initial skill rank of but ever since i have been playing my placement matches i have been faced a problem of my teammates being a nuisance all because of my age i would go in to voice chat because as all of you know voice chat is a key necessity when playing competitive i talk and my teammates basically trash on me and a lot of them dont take me seriously its kind of ironic since people usally take kids being the toxic ones but in my case its the people with the superior lower voices that are toxic i can politely ask someone to switch i dont usally ask people to switch to a certain hero more than once may i add and then they start to mock me it basicaly made me stop talking in voice chat until i got to approx skill ranking and it does happen quite a bit but not as often from when i was around since some of the players i am matching up with now dont care one bit i am not nessicarily sad when my teammates trash talk on me it is just an annoyance but it does make me happy when people can actually treat me equally from someone who is older and i even have found some people who tell the person or people who are trash talking me that they are being childish etc basically standing up for me and i wish the whole community was like that but it is not possible to have a perfect community
Overwatch,removed,people were mean to me on the internet dab your pussy with some tissues and get over it noone cares what your rank is or who is being mean to you
Overwatch,removed,you didnt provide any information or links just a typical reddit fag answer calm down with our assumptions lol kill yourself telling me what i can and cant think about then trying to say you cited evidence and i refuted it

Overwatch,removed,dude fuck off
Overwatch,removed,fuck you feminazi piece of shit
Overwatch,removed,sounds like you need to get a fucking life
Overwatch,removed,you hold is your brain that small you havent figured out you dont have to hold down at all do you even play the game can you fuck off towards that one moba you play can you try to suck on a broken crate of beer bottles
Overwatch,removed,when you cant give a retort and instead rely on insulting things that arent a problem nice keep on bein an idiot my dude

Overwatch,removed,he took this facetious quote out of context to build up a straw man of my character to make his character assassination stronger more effective in other words say i said i really love the kkk s and then he takes the i really love the kkk part makes it a quote and then says this guy is a total ass hole with the quote adding weight to his words the straw man is not the argument but a fake person the effect is similar to how people will call donald trump racist and many of them cant give you a single example of him being racist the straw man that has been built up is this image of donald trump as a racist by his opponents so that its easier to dismiss him as a viable candidate straw man has more meaning than just as a logical fallacy
Overwatch,removed,its in your blood you sound fucking retarded

Overwatch,removed,sub reddit is growing exponentially things are progressing great how the hell do we as mods fuck it all up i know the whole fools notion is based on the flawed premise that discussions are somehow more worthy or desirable than potg or quickly accessible content if that were true the history channel would be the top grossing network you bunch of retards number one rule for modding stay out of the way as much as possible way to sabotage the fastest growing sub reddit with some nonsense about it being a trial period

Overwatch,removed,supreme beings denied
Overwatch,removed,despite his huge health pool he is quite squishy because of his huge hitbox and his lack of damage reduction i wouldnt call him a tank thats the problem that blizzard created when labelling these heroes they are very rough guidelines not hard and fast rules it reminds me of sexuality labels and hilarity of watching a straight guys mind explode when i describe a scenario in which two guys have sex enjoy it and neither of them are gay
Overwatch,removed,thank you very much for your time gives handshake thats like the most basic thing there is interviewer was being a nigger

Overwatch,removed,do u think ur funny kill urself
Overwatch,removed,all sjw should just die they are useless and a waste of oxygen
Overwatch,removed,i demand red dead redemption for a few years ago youd very likely have no overwatch to play at all it wouldve been a pc exclusive in fact if i were blizzard id keep it a pc exclusive and use the remaining money to buy popcorn and watch console princesses rage just like you do on a big screen also since majority of the subreddit are pc gamers patch just hit is true for the majority kudos to blizzard for actually doing that instead of just releasing the patch without worrying about what it may break or not one interesting fact two months of ptr beta still failed to catch the ranking issues caused by shitters leaving games as soon as they start losing rejoice ye peasants for we the pc mustard racers hath the patch thoroughly tested in real life conditions so when it finally reaches the cinematic experience hell it will actually be a much more stable release than what it would be if updates to all platforms were deployed at the same time maybe they just put the pc release of the patch on hold until consoles get it this is exactly what other devs do and thats why releases of acunity and several other titles over the last few years were total failures to the point of pulling it from the shelves nothing tests your software better than tens of thousands of atechnical bads also why didnt you post tens of butthurt shitposts when rockstar decided not to postpone until the pc version is ready we had to wait for that now you wait for ana seems fair to me even if they do theres no reason to not do the same for overwatch theres also no reason to do it because a pc has always been blizzards main target b there is no possibility to ever introduce crossplatform play between pc and consoles because of platformspecific balancing c hero stacking patch was needed fast to cater for the pro scene which uses pc i really hope that when ana gets released on consoles there will be a weekly brawl that will include her but also limit her to anas per team youll probably get something like the current pc brawl
Overwatch,removed,sweet peasant tears
Overwatch,removed,how is that selfish are you actually retarded there is a reason why its on pc before consoles and its not because of anyones selfishness

Overwatch,removed,lol fag who gives a fuck what u do in pleb ville kys
Overwatch,removed,we get it tracer likes pussy and unlike cara delevingne shes not bisexual shes a lesbo you read that right tracer is a dyke
Overwatch,removed,no actually you said journalistic integrity isnt a thing anymore in main stream media you quite literally said all media is lying shes right too youre just going full angry neckbeard with hilariously fucking pathetic comments like i enjoy shitting all over your trash opinions and stay ignorant this is coming from someone who is actually defending that theres nothing wrong with a playboystyle magazine almost as if implying that people are taking it way too seriously yet here you are offending her vehemently and with taste its amazing it really helps your point little buddy really does
Overwatch,removed,it is you who dont understand dont try to justify ur throw you started widow thats all teams morale down nobody wants to play with troll no motivation lots of bad trolls somebody starts to rage because they see no point in playing anymore it was triggered instantly your fault go qp and troll there with ur sombra you is a cancer of todays competitive community simple enough for u
Overwatch,removed,jeff is gay
Overwatch,removed,no ana and phara are arabs that doesnt necessarily mean theyre muslims learn to not take everything in your life so literally especially video games if thats not being overly dramatic for you im not sure you know the definition of it googling the number of muslims is stupid can you please google me the amount of monkeys there are on the moon what do you know overwatch is a fictional game set in the future for all it cares it can have as many christians in egypt as it wants what are the chances for tracer to be gay im sure theyre even lower than that and what do you know she is a hero being a certain way isnt dependent on the stats you provide it depends on the people who created them this is pretty easy to understand if you were competent enough next time you should make an effort not to sound like the condescending cunt that you are im done with this youre just wasting my time
Overwatch,removed,youre not even reading the meta reports you illiterate retard quadruple and triple tanks absolutely dominated the line ups everyone who wanted to be special butterflies in the games that actually mattered lost of the heroes had less than percent usage rates heroes had less than percent of the team comps at mlg were triple quad tank in combination of iem and mlg the team combinations were triple tank quad tank

Overwatch,removed,you never made a specific claim heres a specific claim you made low iq confirmed
Overwatch,removed,i dont think someone with your intelligence even realized the irony of that comment
Overwatch,removed,it is the fault of the user for getting it on console version and you can get a refund then get it on pc
Overwatch,removed,i guess not you never even addressed the blatant contradiction i pointed out my claim that you have a low iq is very well founded at this point
Overwatch,removed,its not racist simple fact there is nothing somebody with disability can do on a console that they cant do better on pc
Overwatch,removed,sorry bub but when you willingly support companies whos only business strategy is hostageware on underpowered and overpriced garbage you get zero sympathy

Overwatch,removed,im level and ive seen hero stacking in only matches maybe its more common on pc because pc players are faggots this barely happens on
Overwatch,removed,hey this mechanic is done lets push it to the test serverlive server whoah whoah whoah its not done you need to go through the microsoft patch checklist and ensure you meet the requirements but its done and it works fine can we just send it out to our pc base first and then go through that checklist and send it out to microsoft after whoah what do you think this is you want a patch to be more than a week or two apart fans will outrage we will lose playerbase and sales dont tell the pc its ready and they wont be none the wiser get your shit together tom tom goes home how was your day honey not good dear i suggested a great idea at work but all i got in return was a tongue lashing about smoke and mirrors well did you assert yourself and explain your sid pow bam blap did i ask for you to talk back sally get your ass over here when im talking to you you think i am not a man well ill show you just how manly i am whack pow boom you start mouthing off thinking you know everything i am just trying to make a living and get us by but no its never good enough smash crash boom helhello i i think someone broke in my wife she isnt breathing please hurry ties rope to support beam hmph stupid console jumps based on the last dev diary i read

Overwatch,removed,yeah buy it for pc
Overwatch,removed,im tired of console people always complaining you should have known better before buying an fps game to play with a controller
Overwatch,removed,you were literally proven wrong about older pcsdoing the same thing consoles do downscaling to i proved that consoles dont have to do that especially for overwatch and you come back with more bullshit using big words in your broken english doesnt make you smart also using words that arent used in conversational english doesnt make you smart nothing youve said makes you smart attacking my character doesnt make you smart it makes you desperate because you cant actually come up with solid evidence to back your bullshit up with pcs are cheaper because i said so thats your entire argument my god youre denser than most fedorawearing neckbeard basement dwellers that subscribe to pcmr and call people peasants so you should be proud of that

Overwatch,removed,that argument is so bullshit that im surprised people who are stupid enough to believe it still exist but here you are let me break it down real simply before getting into the weeds with it quality over quantity or the weakest link argument in essence it doesnt matter how many bad players are on each team rather it matters how bad the individual worst player is a team of very mediocre players will absolutely destroy a team with one really good player and one brain dead monkey the rule of large numbers fails here because your team objectively has fewer idiots yet will still lose because you had the single biggest idiot working as a saboteur also theres the bullshit argument that if you were so good you could carry that is false for several reasons character role and relative level of skill for you to carry ridiculously well and work yourself up to a competent level you by yourself have to basically be better than every other player on the opposing team combined in a role which would secure victory basically youd have to be a one man army most players are not that and very frequently get stuck in matches with players slightly lower than their own intended rank meaning youre the best teammate but not the best individual in a team game this shit matters even diamond players who intentionally tank their ranking to smurf or do a climbing challenge take much longer than they should if they run into a team that works together regarding character role this is also important since each hero is designated into certain roles the best lucio in the world wouldnt be all that useful for a team that doesnt stay alive long enough to be healed to full and the best genji clearing out a defensive blockade wouldnt be useful if his team refuses to push the advantage also say the best genji is a mediocre zarya but the team really needs a zarya do you think him switching to a role hes bad at will work out well chances are it wont because while he might have game sense he lacks the mechanical skill to make the most use out of the character in short the argument is flawed and youre an idiot

Overwatch,removed,gportero in the forth email in gporteros inbox he repeats the same statement twice also mentions november como dorado es mi hogar y por supuesto el hogar de lumérico pensé que sería apropiado conmemorar la ocasión como dorado es mi hogar y por supuesto el hogar de lumérico pensé que sería apropiado conmemorar la ocasión edit english translation as dorado is my home and of course home to lumérico i thought it would be appropriate to commemorate the occasion as dorado is my home and of course home to lumérico i thought it would be appropriate to commemorate the occasion could the repetition mean something

Overwatch,removed,
Overwatch,removed,thats funny i actually get paid to play on peoples accounts and rank them up i honestly have no idea how anyone struggles to beat people in that rank range you might be delusional and think youre better than you are because neither me or anyone else i work with has any trouble solocarrying low ranked games
Overwatch,removed,but if youre interested in paying good money i could direct you to the site i work for
Overwatch,removed,as long as delusional people like you keep paying money because they think they belong at a higher rank ill keep taking their money youre just not good its okay to admit it maybe practice some and youll realize how dumb you sound i only soloq and have two accounts i ranked to its super easy

Overwatch,removed,hey congrats on your first sale but did you mean your first sale of this design i just went through your shop and you have stars as well as some reviews yet i cannot seem to find any of the items that you have sold in the past your reviews also seem to state that your stuff is overpriced and usually late which judging by your items as compared to other shops on the same site they are i apologize if it may seem as i am poisoning the well i feel my gf would find one of these cute but given that i also own a few online businesses one of them deals with many of the products that you sell i kind of wanted more information on why your items have disappeared and been replaced by many different types of products with the same graphic design ps i kinda also gotta add that what i think youre doing is kinda dirty ive seen people get banned from reddit for simply posting a link to their online shops yet here you straight up changing the entirety of your online ship and advertising really only one product on a reddit sub at pretty high markups at that
Overwatch,removed,or could we just not have these stupid ass cartoons at all this is a video game not a girlfag guy place to show off their stupid unfunny shit

Overwatch,removed,this is utterly disgusting you didnt forget to ask for her number or game tag you didnt have the balls you never do you have got to be fucking kidding me so this stereotypical socially inept neckbeard this fedorasporting friendzoned niceguy has a brief conversation with ms cosplaymanicpixie and decides that her brief polite conversation as he has received from so many female cashiers and waitresses is a sign that they want an immature selfconscious sexist to mate with genius so since she coyly did not give out her name phone number battlenet id email twitter handle or any other identifying information with which he could stalk and harass her he instead launches an embarrassing and horrifyingly objectifying internet campaign to enlist the help of his fellow redpill mras to help him stalk and find this young woman with polygon and other news outlets adding to the implicit pressure that this trophy i mean young woman come forward so she can be claimed as the prize that she is and fulfill his fantasy having earned sex that she is obliged to give through the white knights valiant quest to stalk mlady online yet another reason women dont go to cons they would love dont cosplay dont even play female bodies or named characters or use voice chat online thank you making viral for enforcing this harmful dehumanizing narrative towards female gamers this is why we cant have nice things this is not now normal people behave this is why gamersnerds have a horrible reputation as rapejoke making basementdwelling year old virgins if only you could just enjoy the fun moment you had you say you can live without this person but youre the one who couldnt let it go and built it her up in your mind while dehumanizing her believe me im a total gamer nerd magic player wow player im part of this community and this is not who we are or how we act if someone your sister or girlfriend randomly saw was jerking off to her in the shower and trying to find her online you would be creeped out

Overwatch,removed,i dont have to buddy i can just go over to rthedouchebag and get all of the racism xenophobia and misogyny that i need its called guilt by association
Overwatch,removed,sorry but i am tracking down people who post crazy shit in the rthedonald since we cant interact with them there and most of them rarely post outside of that subreddit it spills over to other places on the site
Overwatch,removed,shitty thing in a shitty section youre calling it fan content so why the hell you put this into news discussion instead of fucking fan content
Overwatch,removed,this is your base racism xenophobia and misogyny in one package there are shittons of these guys out there i grew up with many of them if you want to associate with people like this go for it but youre going to get shit from me and other people like me because we are tired of narrowmindedness and hate were tired of some unqualified asshole using fear to pander to the lesseducated and that is what he is a fearmongering demagogue who has tricked you into thinking that he is on your side but he isnt he doesnt give a fuck about you or anyone else he was born with a silver spoon in his mouth and somehow bluecollar white americans thinks that he represents them and that is only because social issues get in the way they are too homophobic to scared of minorities to realise that they are voting against their own self interests it is pure madness
Overwatch,removed,because your other sub doesnt permit opposing viewpoints and spams the fuck out of rall with inane bullshit if you want to fix that stuff take that up with your mods otherwise im coming after you guys in other places sorry if you dont like it see the left isnt so docile after all

Overwatch,removed,the prevalence of pornography related to overwatch astounds me the game isnt even fully released yet now we are getting models made yeah those types of models the ones with bodygrouped erect cocks models with bouncy tits and asses while they get fucked with plenty of space to add on shiny iridescent semen models as they get fucked in a plethora of positions there are also a bunch of variants boys girls dickgirls crazy flopping genitals and penises with the inclusion of vaginas also which is commonly referred to as futa pornhub and the front page of common distributors such as reddit are flooded with these posts and reports have arrived that the prevalence of overwatch porn is reaching into the thousands percentage wise popular characters include widowmaker who is a spiderthemed feminine opponent who is commonly portrayed in various dominant positions with or without a penis while the character tracer is liked as a jolly fuck toy indeed the boundaries of internet porn have been changed as different artists on tumblr have been using different animation software to create looping animations commonly in webm format of these characters engaged in violent sexual intercourse synced with female moaning sounds from sound libraries authentic drum and bass music and slapping effects as the balls flop under the asses of such characters one could go as far to say that these artists are actually paid marketers who use sex the industrys largest selling point to sell the game which has already payed off considering the recent purchases these animators the ones that you send your paycheck on patreon to are simply pawns in an elaborate marketing scheme never before seen the likes of which could potentially rival the fox news mass erect controversy of its release the prevalence of the porn can only be the product of a large campaign a conspiracy if you will by rightwing libertarianconservative sexaddicted millennials for those of you who simply take the game for granted you are being controlled by an elaborate scheme which can only be the result of antisemetic newage marketers taking advantage of your sex addiction to sell a mediocre game
Overwatch,removed,to skinny need dat onion booty

Overwatch,removed,roverwatchporn
Overwatch,removed,then why are you constantly talking about it
Overwatch,removed,no one is free to harass anyone for any reason so yeah youre way of thinking is the same as a toxic hateful child learn to let people like whatever they want
Overwatch,removed,httpyoutubemfhcbooslk press the subscribe button and youll be saying in people blogs views since jan httpwwwredditcomryoutubefactsbotwikiindex
Overwatch,removed,oh man and you know this because oh right you dont know shit
Overwatch,removed,calling a retard retard is not projecting but of course a retard such as yourself wouldnt know that
Overwatch,removed,people hating others and harassing them just because they like something is completely retarded and childish them liking something doesnt hurt anyone it doesnt ruin lives it doesnt affect others what youre saying is just bullshit that would mean someone could go around yelling racial slurs at people and that no one should care if they do i just dont know how you can be this fucking retarded honestly
Overwatch,removed,yes learn arabic so u can communicate with all the terrorists
Overwatch,removed,its not according to your logic they have to accept that that person doesnt like for example mexicans and therefore there can be no repercussions they have to just sit there and take whatever that person is saying because they have to accept that that person does not like them cant believe that youre this retarded youre telling me theres no reason to hate someone who harasses people because they like something then you see someone getting bullied and shit because theyre a man who likes other men or a woman who likes other women and thats awful but somehow not the same someone liking something is never a reason to harass them that kind of childish toxic thinking is fucking absurd
Overwatch,removed,you actually try to justify harassing others because of what they like you actually try to make it seem like its an okay thing to do and to top it off you dont even understand what youre doing you dont understand what youre saying just because you dont get harassed because of the things you like you feel like its okay youre a sad pathetic person
Overwatch,removed,think this is appropiate here httpsyoutubebhkajzcrls

Overwatch,removed,i dont blame them for getting mad at retards
Overwatch,removed,blizzard fix overtime make it the way it use to be the current overtime system is pointless and useless and fucking stupid fix it now you cucks
Overwatch,removed,you still dont get it do you its like talking to a wall except worse walls cant reply with stupid bullshit you dont get to decide how much someone gets to like something its not up to you the fact that that word exists at all and is used at all is the problem here thats like yelling racial slurs at someone and people telling whoever is being harassed that they should just stop caring and get over it youre a sad person
Overwatch,removed,oh yea because uploading some dumbass potg takes so much more effort im not against the spirit of this rule but the wording is godawful seriously rewrite your rules that is embarassing
Overwatch,removed,first
Overwatch,removed,nah i dont give a fuck about the morale of my team i know that im carrying and thats it if i legit want to advance despite retards like you in the queue ill go with mates that are like le in cs but still manage to win with them instead of the trolls you meet in soloqueue lost in a row and deranked from to in just under hours solo queue is just impossible with kids like you running rampant in ranked when the only place you belong is quickplay and what makes you assume im mad this is overwatch probably even more casual of a shooter than cod is from a competitive esports standpoint you cant take this game too serious to begin with way too many factors playing against it
Overwatch,removed,end your life cancer troll fuck you

Overwatch,removed,theres the smug troll we know and love i had a feeling youd go back to the tried and true method no hard feelings i understand that simple logic is pretty hard to refute and i appreciate that instead of just vanishing in embarrassment youve chosen to continue to keep me company this is my favorite part the part where you read plain and simple logic have absolutely nothing reasonable to say back so your only recourse is to pretend you were too good to read it that alone would be satisfying enough but then you also pretend your inability to format a comment is on purpose i know youre just doing that to make me feel good but wait theres more in the same point you attempt to refute something i said in my comment and simultaneously claim to not have read it httpiimgurcomqfiffempng you went to so much trouble to get me something and i didnt get you anything what can i get you on such short notice the only thing i really know about you is that youre insecure perhaps then you can wake up inspired every day i know it doesnt really compare to everything you got me but i have to get you something or ill just feel terrible xoxo

Overwatch,removed,jewceo
Overwatch,removed,funny some cuck kept on going afk last night because he ordered pizza reported his ass real quick
Overwatch,removed,
Overwatch,removed,yes hooray you fucking tard
Overwatch,removed,reminds me of darksydephil wow how was i supposed to know you dont run straight at a bastion bugged mechanics thanks blizzard manbabies cant take any responsibility for their actions i swear
Overwatch,removed,is that cheater still on your team
Overwatch,removed,lul bad at kids games lul
Overwatch,removed,dont listen to the cunt at the bottom of the thread op wallpaper looks pretty dope would love it if you made one for hanzo seeing as he is my favorite character
Overwatch,removed,the things i have seen
Overwatch,not_removed,what was the play here
Overwatch,not_removed,should have uploaded with sound but ana actually says back off at the end there
Overwatch,not_removed,it was just the completely necessary sleep dart and crotch punch
Overwatch,not_removed,i also met a cool ass ana using stay as a group function then we proceeded to crush games in a row haha
Overwatch,not_removed,i made a six stack today and won in a row its awesome meeting people like that
Overwatch,not_removed,yeah ive met tons more people like this i think its really helpful for shyer folk who might be a little cautious about outright adding people or asking to group up its also kinda morale boosting especially if you feel you coordinated and played well with your team my only complaint is the frustrating groupteam chat bug where it doesnt automatically readd you back to group when you leave a game
Overwatch,not_removed,glad we seeing some good orisa plays watch everyone think she weak now but once a streamer a use her everyone goin know she the best big thing
Overwatch,not_removed,recently ive been coming across a lot of players who are not going to try and just be afkpick torb and cry the whole match because we have picked a team that means we dont want to win and this is in quick play honestly people need to just fuck off and lemme play my video games
Overwatch,not_removed,well if anyone would be good at rolling the tire it would be
Overwatch,not_removed,shame these are not in the same games though
Overwatch,not_removed,calls you bad on kings row wipe is on numbani i am mildly suspicious edit pause on the chat screenshot at the start notice the curvy lines on the floor thats only on numbani i was mistaken theyre not on different maps
Overwatch,not_removed,junkrat used to be my frustration pick when teammates were just not protecting the healers or slowing their tanks at all overtime i now routinely pick him and without question i will get someone asking me to change before the game even starts junkrat is a viable option for killing flankers weakening tanks and just causing mayhem in traditional routes people brush him off as being weak or easy to be countered but he can do a great deal to disrupt the other team if played right my favorite thing to do is to pick junkrat to counter a poorly organized meta where the tanks are either out of position or overly aggressive
Overwatch,not_removed,he meant bad as in badass obivously s
Overwatch,not_removed,i tell you ive about had it with all the bitching i see in game chat if its not my own team griping about my pick of hero its the opposing team griping about it youve never played with me if i pick a fucking hero its because i feel most confident with that pick if it looks like my pick isnt working for the strat ill change it but i wont change it because you told me to and if youre on the opposing team dont gripe about my pick either just because you dont know how to properly counter my hero doesnt mean i should play someone else
Overwatch,not_removed,this is why i never tell someone to switch to someone you dont feel comfortable playing
Overwatch,not_removed,doubt youll see this but i just played with you said id come check it out and here i am
Overwatch,not_removed,the taunt is perfect for the situation its like junkrat is pretending the bear trap is
Overwatch,not_removed,what i hear just ai fighting ai
Overwatch,not_removed,and thinking
Overwatch,not_removed,do they have iqs of
Overwatch,not_removed,huh whats wrong with torb i have a win rate with him in comp and im diamond
Overwatch,not_removed,well if you want to play attack widow so much you have no right to be mad at me for picking torb or hanzo
Overwatch,not_removed,well i mean by picking torb hes just playing his video game albeit in a childish way
Overwatch,not_removed,it is i only have windows movie maker and im bad at it so i took screen shots when i was watching my capture in full screen then cropped them using paint
Overwatch,not_removed,looks like numbani to me
Overwatch,not_removed,it is numbani i dont have video editing software so i just took a screenshot shot then cropped it out in paint
Overwatch,not_removed,lol how can you tell tho i had no idea haha
Overwatch,not_removed,i honestly hate junk — i feel like he mostly charges healer ults and zarya damage unless he is played well as in better than the skill level of the game that said there is a rein in almost every game and hes amazing versus rein so you cant be too negative anything can work lord knows if you play a lot of rein you get pretty annoyed when you see a defensive junk facerolling nades at the choke losing to cheesy spam defenses like torbsymjunk is the most demoralizing shit
Overwatch,not_removed,you can pick anything to counter a poorly organized meta the problem with junkrat is that it is only good on defense not useful on attack and koth and yet his ult is not very useful when enemy attack with multiple ults
Overwatch,not_removed,junkrat is love junkrat is life
Overwatch,not_removed,i find junkrat is an amazing pick when you are getting stomped on an escort map and they are just stacking together if i get a good flank i can cause a ton of damage before they know what happened worst case i distract them all for my team to clean up while quickly charging my ult
Overwatch,not_removed,ive been using junkrat in qp a lot lately and hes really grown on me wouldnt be instapicking him in a ranked match but he does have use i especially like breaking reins shield with him
Overwatch,not_removed,i dont have a problem with junk its when the enemy team has both a phara and a zarya and junk doesnt switch to a hitscan to help counter i would dps but then no one heals lol
Overwatch,not_removed,im so with you the community on this game is toxic the number of hateful messages i receive from players on my own team before the game even starts is ridiculous
Overwatch,not_removed,this is honestly why im afraid to try new heroes in qp im a soft person and i have issues blocking out the hate
Overwatch,not_removed,if i pick a fucking hero its because i feel most confident with that pick what you may not realize is that this is very often not the case there are way too many trolls and derankers floating around
Overwatch,not_removed,some people often dont understand that their pick isnt working for specific reasons for example some people dont realize that the enemy zarya is getting massive amounts of charge from their junkrat spam these people will just run this strat into the ground without ever realizing what the problem is if you dont tell them the fact they ive never played with you is exactly why im asking you to switch i have no idea whether youre competent enough to realize this so id rather not take the chance
Overwatch,not_removed,yes i saw it was on enchinwald spelling my friend who is new to the game was playing junkrat and i didnt get to play him
Overwatch,not_removed,nigga youre in silver
Overwatch,not_removed,im pretty sure people think youre rating if you pick him or something because that would be logical being in diamond and all
Overwatch,not_removed,attack widow defense widow every time especially early on hybridpayload maps with sightlines kings row
Overwatch,not_removed,you can pick what you want to play i couldnt care less about the comp its more them saying that we want to loose and therefore act like an ass the whole game no problem with picking torb its the attitude that they are going to pick torb and not do anything with him
Overwatch,not_removed,i appreciate the effort you put in to entertain me for seconds
Overwatch,not_removed,my bad they are both on numbani
Overwatch,not_removed,to play junkrat effectively you need to be able to put someone down instead of charging ults that is what people fail at doing when playing him or playing against him flankers and healers are easy enough to kill with a trap mine and maybe an additional grenade tanks on the other hand i would agree that a bad junk could just feed ult charge to tanks and healers if they are not finishing the kill i will only be firing at tanks either when my tanks or other dps are around to finish the kill im in a solo situation that im confident ill win or if it is a last ditch desperation to push them back while my team spawns junkrat usually starts to be a non factor in higher ranks such as master but even at lowmid diamond ive used this strategy to be very effective people just seem to ignore him and assume junkrat cant be effective because he is never part of the meta obviously the best way to be effective as junkrat is to have a supporting team around but that is no different than any other character i love feeding my tanks and other dps kills so all our ults charge
Overwatch,not_removed,i am a tracer junkrat player i know when and where to shoot
Overwatch,not_removed,people started to play rein again idk about comp because i didnt played it this season but in my qp games its still all fucking roadhog and zarya
Overwatch,not_removed,at higher ranks surebut i would suspect most of us in this sub are not all grand masters and what not most of us are probably around the platinum level where junkrat can be effective as with any character there is a time and place junkrat is good at defense and he can be effective in some koth maps not so much on offense but ive used him when my team is falling apart because they are not giving support back to the healers or no one is bothering to at least slow up the enemies flankers
Overwatch,not_removed,join in qp press p leave both text chat and voice chat enjoy a chill game while you try a new hero
Overwatch,not_removed,just get into a stack and just banter all match super easy to block out hate when youre just chilling with friends
Overwatch,not_removed,youre fine hey maybe you should try playing in a full stack of friends it feels much better to fail as widow with friends because at least you get to laugh at it with them and you also get to hear all the stories they have to tell and you end up not focusing on the game but rather on the story theyre telling because its so interesting and funny at least thats my experience p just today i was playing with this guy whos a friend of my friend and he started talking about a comp match he had where he was at one win away from diamond and one of the randoms started rambling about final fantasy hey guys do you like ff yeah i like ff i think im gonna play ff the random then quits out to play and it makes him lose the match and so his losing streak started this guys at mid plat right now and every time we play i dont know him hes just a friend of my friend he starts saying wow you me are so high up you actually got to masters im still at plat or hey i got kill participation but if me was playing tracer shed get is just uhhh average poor guy he plays widow so much in qp but when i check his comp stats he only plays meta lúcio rein tracer his problem is his game sense really when we play qp it feels like he forgets about whats going on around him and only focuses on what he is doing he trickles a lot tldr sorry about rambling about what happened to me today but try and get a group of kind friends set up and youll be able to play anything you want ive been trying out sombra in qp and they never talk shit about me this guy i was talking about above always seems to go widow and nobody says anything however when we lose a little voice in my head says it was his fault p
Overwatch,not_removed,first telling someone else what to do is pretty jackassey in general in a game asking is much better and much more likely to get a positive response as in zarya just blasted me at energy and shes charging off your grenades can you counter with reaper first youre asking not telling so youre not being a dick second youre asking for help which shows you value their contribution third youre asking for something specific so youre more likely to get a response its a win all around youre not a jerk and youre more likely to get what you want all it takes is a little psychology obviously this works mostly in voice chat i honestly never read text chat anyway
Overwatch,not_removed,this
Overwatch,not_removed,i know right especially when paired with hanzo torb sombra bastion and soldier as solo healer i think we played some games together today
Overwatch,not_removed,actually theres not if you play to win its exactly the same the reasoning behind the pick is irrelevant if you afk then that is an entirely different situation
Overwatch,not_removed,isnt rein mandatory for most team comps on capture points
Overwatch,not_removed,no one plays rein in qp because your team wont back you up hes pretty much necessary in comp though
Overwatch,not_removed,does midgold count as plat p
Overwatch,not_removed,playing on console helps everyone is equally badand by bad i mean not heart crushing like pc accuracy no text chat and i dont join vc
Overwatch,not_removed,i understand this but its just an internalization kind of thing right now the only characters thatd i say im remotely competent with are mercy and roadhog but im trying to learn reinhardt d va zarya ana and zenyatta in quickplay so that i have a broader lot of characters that i can be good with but my teams seem to always be vocal when im not playing to their standards i cant stop them from getting under my skin and ive even had days where i had to drop mid match because of it
Overwatch,not_removed,yeah my biggest problem with all of these sorts of players is how demanding and whiny they are about it i get it you have an idea in your head about what a good team comp is that being said spewing nonstop rage and whining about it is just about the least effective way to turn your ideas into reality
Overwatch,not_removed,did i say it was good when the rest of your team comp is complete shit no if you get even kill as widow you can change a fight on attack simply because you are now fighting and the opposing player has to walk all the way back if you had hanzo torb sombra bastion and soldier as the healer on attack widow was least of your worries torb is no where near as useful as widow on attack in fact id say the biggest problem was the torb bastion combo with no tank and no proper healer
Overwatch,not_removed,apparently in qp he isnt widow and hanzo are tho
Overwatch,not_removed,oh i totally agree its also condescending and probably wrong there was that guy who was diamond i think and decided to just play torbjorn every game in comp and he did great its all about knowing your character and playing them all this stuff about meta and countering is really only relevant to a very select tier of top players for of matches its best to just play the character youre best with
Overwatch,not_removed,did i say it was good when the rest of your team comp is complete shit and did i say that attack widow is worse than defense widow
Overwatch,not_removed,just because your turret auto targets and hits each enemy for damage doesnt mean your having a big impact its really easy to get gold eliminations as torb while at the same time having very little impact on the game plus gold means nothing when you lose youre team throwing because you picked torb is shitty and stupid but in all honesty if youre playing to win torb isnt a good pick except very situationally against flankers that your team cant keep track of or in cheese defense strategies usually that just means theyre bad though
Overwatch,not_removed,im not sure why i was downvoted but id like to clarify that i did not at all mean to sound like rage and toxicity was a solution
Overwatch,not_removed,well if you want to play attack widow so much you have no right to be mad at me for picking torb or hanzo why are so mad about attack widow why are you specifically mad about attack widow why are you playing torbhanzo instead of a tankhealer secondly especially when paired with hanzo torb sombra bastion and soldier as solo healer why are you not more mad that your entire team comp is shit
Overwatch,not_removed,found the guy who is toxic ingame
Overwatch,not_removed,i play torb on defence only and with a good spot on toa i can effectively get rid of flankers and cover the point with turret leaving me free to go to the front lines and provide fire on the enemy teamprovide armor
Overwatch,not_removed,that damage keeps all flankers at bay and attracts fire and thats just his turret his weapon is one of the strongest in the game
Overwatch,not_removed,if youre platinum arguably diamond or below hero choice doesnt really matter much a vast majority of players barely have the mechanics down let alone the map awareness to play around a torb turret dont assume that the meta at high elo applies to all levels of play it really really doesnt
Overwatch,not_removed,i assume you mostly got downvoted for this line i have no idea whether youre competent enough to realize this so id rather not take the chance you come off a bit there as sounding like you assume youre better more competent than your teammates because you dont like the hero they pick im not saying you mean to say that but you could read it that way
Overwatch,not_removed,why are so mad about attack widow why are you specifically mad about attack widow im not specifically mad about attack widow hanzo torb doesnt matter widow was first thing which came to mind i typed just widow but then added attack because i also put torb in a sentence and defense torb is okay right now youre missing the point and act like youre mad because i offended your favourite hero or smth why are you playing torbhanzo instead of a tankhealer because when its game in a row when i get widowhanzo in my team i dont feel like tryharding and then being disappointed again only way to still have fun is to give up and go full retard too stop caring about win just have fun with silly picks why are you not more mad that your entire team comp is shit at this point nope when it already became a full troll party i can just have fun i get mad only when me and people are trying to win the game but feel helpless because some dude with avg accuracy decided hes playing only widow today the point is when you pick shitty heroes or pick them in bad situations or refuse to switch when they dont work dont expect your team to tryhard and carry you dont be a hypocrite like the guy to whom i originally replied aka mr i will only play x but fuck you if you pick torb because of it you should be carrying me wtf dude you want to have fun accept the fact that other people want this too play whatever you want but if you are not trying to win dont expect that your teammates will full troll games have their charm its like arcade trying to do your best while one dude just refuses to care isnt its like playing football with some random guys on the schoolyard its not professional game no one expect you to be messi you can make mistakes you just play for fun but if you decide that today you only want to practice shots and refuse to pass the ball to anybody on your team can you honestly blame them for thinking that youre an asshole and acting accordingly
Overwatch,not_removed,using the word toxic in reference to computer games makes you sound so stupid
Overwatch,not_removed,yeah that was a mistake i only meant that i cant know in this case if junkrat will continue to spam charge zarya in this case id much rather say something than to mind my own business and lose im the kind of person who doesnt mind if someone calls me out for something detrimental im doing especially if i dont realize im doing it id rather win than my team spare my feelings
Overwatch,not_removed,moderate opinion and it still gets downvoted this sub shuts down discussion harder than any gaming sub ive seen
Overwatch,not_removed,in what other contexts is it regularly used swamp gas the word has a very defined meaning when it comes to online gaming and hes using it correctly
Overwatch,not_removed,yeah im with you i think talking about comp in the game is just smart even if its qp thats good communication i guess my point is theres a way to do it and be an ass and a way to do it and not be an ass cricketdrop ffs switch off junkrat hes trash zarya is raping me is being an ass cricketdrop zarya has you countered can you swap to dps is not being an ass i wish i saw more of the latter and less of the former
Overwatch,not_removed,you need to use the humor flair even if it isnt funny
Overwatch,not_removed,
Overwatch,not_removed,the devi skin comes with golden turrets
Overwatch,not_removed,torbjörn does too
Overwatch,not_removed,i main symmetra and would love to see her turrets and teleporter goldenbut as you said she needs a highlight intro or a pose to showoff her weps
Overwatch,not_removed,junkrat needs a golden riptire then too d
Overwatch,not_removed,i main her but cause of working at gamescom i couldnt manage to hit the to stop at aug managed to get to otherwise i wouldve bought it
Overwatch,not_removed,i cant wait to get my first golden gun i am going to get symmetras as well
Overwatch,not_removed,roadhog gets a golden hook and shotgun jealous
Overwatch,not_removed,i want mei to have golden walls and i dont even play mei
Overwatch,not_removed,i think symmetra just needs a buff in general
Overwatch,not_removed,i main her and i plan on getting her golden when i rack up enough points think i need like or so more for the very reason that its likely unlikely
Overwatch,not_removed,i have golden symmetra gun but would be dope if her turrets were gold too
Overwatch,not_removed,symmetra needs mains her golden gun almost pointless show off her gun worthwhile investment dude
Overwatch,not_removed,i didnt even think of this
Overwatch,not_removed,lol
Overwatch,not_removed,what make them more conspicuous nah they need to blend in with the concrete dont nerf symmetra
Overwatch,not_removed,devi skin
Overwatch,not_removed,what about a golden left arm since thats what she uses to make her turrets its kind of like torbjors hammer it seems like a weapon to her
Overwatch,not_removed,saw gold symetra turrets the other day arent they gold with gold weapon skin pretty sure they are
Overwatch,not_removed,wouldnt that just make them stand out more i meansure go for itbut id never use that
Overwatch,not_removed,i was totally down to get her golden weapon but then they nerfed her torrents on console and i havent played her as much because i feel less effective on a team
Overwatch,not_removed,i main her with gold gun symmetra is my love check my global pro god symmetra end of season
Overwatch,not_removed,they could make her beam golden
Overwatch,not_removed,precisely
Overwatch,not_removed,yes please we need an all gold torb turret blizz plox
Overwatch,not_removed,i specifically bought and use her vishkar skin because the turrets are black my hope is that theyre harder to see when theyre not firing
Overwatch,not_removed,zenyattas golden weapons o my gawd
Overwatch,not_removed,ganymede needs to have his beak talons and monocle golden
Overwatch,not_removed,dva should have a golden meka
Overwatch,not_removed,you must have had a really high win rate otherwise id expect normal win points to have gotten you there
Overwatch,not_removed,do you need to buy them separately
Overwatch,not_removed,and i want mei golden showers
Overwatch,not_removed,dual wielding
Overwatch,not_removed,do you work for fox
Overwatch,not_removed,listen they said the golden gun is almost pointless because none of her animations show it off whatsoever its only shown off when shes in game read the fucking post its basically almost pointless because unlike every other hero she doesnt show off her gun in any of her victory poses or highlight intros
Overwatch,not_removed,that gives it an acctual in game benefit because ensues wont easily know if is a friendly or unfriendly beam
Overwatch,not_removed,impressive
Overwatch,not_removed,how am i spposed ter give it all oive got vithout a golden turret
Overwatch,not_removed,skins give advantage pay to win confirmed s
Overwatch,not_removed,bva but really the golden weapon and junebug skin were like made for each other
Overwatch,not_removed,winrate
Overwatch,not_removed,same with me rank but only had around comp points and didnt have the time to play more before season ends hopefully ill have more time to play this season so i have two at the end symmetras and junkrats
Overwatch,not_removed,nope
Overwatch,not_removed,hand of midas
Overwatch,not_removed,but how would you shoot the balls
Overwatch,not_removed,people downvoting you are retarded this guy and people who upvoted him did not read what the op said they just quoted random bits that made op look like a moron
Overwatch,not_removed,i noe rite also how else would ardvark pay off if we dont get a golden turret nothing has payed off
Overwatch,not_removed,cough wolf hanzo cough
Overwatch,not_removed,oh yeah man they fit perfectly the gold guns work pretty well with carbon fiber too i love the black and gold
Overwatch,not_removed,puke em
Overwatch,not_removed,oh ive read the post alright here have the version for sarcasm immune people she doesnt need golden turrets cause cosmetics dont affect gameplay balance no one mains her because the whole concept of maining in overwatch is stupid to begin with every golden gun is almost pointless by definition given theyre cosmetic options you want golden turrets cause her gun doesnt show up in introsposes guess what neither do the turrets an investment per se implies the expectation of benefit in exchange for your resources allocation there are no worthwhile investments in golden guns
Overwatch,not_removed,xddddd
Overwatch,not_removed,okami yo waga teki wo kurae
Overwatch,not_removed,yeah its sarcasm okay thanks for explaining that because theres no way to tell its sarcasm on the internet also your points still suck and you fucking editted the original post it originally said symmetra needsbolded golden gun almost pointlessbolded show off her gun worthwhile investment dude now it says symmetra needs mains her golden gun almost pointless show off her gun worthwhile investment dude nobody needs anything nobody needed golden weapons it was a thing of niceness given to the community by the devs that doesnt mean they should just say fuck off its free they should address the service theyve provided if a golden weapon flat out didnt work they could just pass on fixing it using that logic maining a hero means you pick them over most heroes when theyre a viable pick if you have the option to play them youre going to play them at least at first most people who main in overwatch dont do it like they do in mobas they actually will gladly switch especially if asked only exceptions are genjihanzo pickers the golden guns are pointless but by definition so is competitive so are loot boxes so are cosmetics who cares right a lot of people actually you cant go pretend that this shit doesnt matter to some people otherwise it wouldnt be in the game and this game would still be the same way it was at release people wanna see this game be the best it can be golden turrets would solve the issue of her golden weapon being mostly unnoticeable she spends most of her time putting up her turrets finding the teleport spot and peaking corners to spam orbs people rarely get to look at her unless shes just dead people do get to see the turret and teleporter the fact none of her weapons at all show in any of her animations outside of the games pretty lame but theres no fix unless they make the arm itself gold which wouldnt work on certain skins an investment implies the expectation of benefit in exchange for your resources allocation this is literally putting in time and effort to buy something nice to look at that alone is worthwhile if you enjoy it if you can show off the fact you care about symmetra enough to have a golden weapon for her it means you like her and youre serious about playing her if you cant see the point of any golden weapon period why are you even discussing them just fuck off lol they were not made for you therefore they should not be tailored to you tldr fuck off this shit might not matter to you but it matters to others stop being a cunt
Overwatch,not_removed,yes i edited my post to add the stupid quote about maining in overwatch now solve the issue of being mostly unnoticeable people rarely get to look at her effort to buy something nice to look at that alone is worthwhile fuck off this shit might not matter to you but it matters to others stop being a cunt i dont think you need golden guns i think you need love man symmetra is not important you are go out take a walk get some fresh air ♥
Overwatch,not_removed,that was nice to hear but im ok i dont really get how quote and relate to me needing some fresh air though s
Overwatch,not_removed,i hope i never get to play against you would be so annoyed
Overwatch,not_removed,i appreciate how well done and put together this along with the editing and music i think it was a slight misstep though to accentuate the sound of the arrow firing as hearing it repeatedly just makes it feel less fluiddetracts from the music as far as the game play is concerned i felt you could further break up shooting arrows type scenes further with not only ultimates but maybe wall run type scenes examples dodge enemy earthshatter with wall run drop back down to scattershot enemy riendhart or flanks you you wall run over the other sidemedkit wall run back over scatter i know youve managed a few of these and they feel truly kickass when you pull it off so why not include them and break it up a bit well done overall look forward to your next one
Overwatch,not_removed,i like the editing but the end was out of the blue
Overwatch,not_removed,holy crap dude i think i have to start practicing some archery beast
Overwatch,not_removed,ana just accepts her death
Overwatch,not_removed,im the kind of guy that would jump off the ledge just to not give dva a kill
Overwatch,not_removed,i was thinking the same id rather not give dva more ult charge for the next one
Overwatch,not_removed,the kill that she get with her ult dont charge for the next one tho would still jump off hehe
Overwatch,not_removed,heh i just posted a sym vid where the ult came in seconds
Overwatch,not_removed,whole enemy team is dead and still only person on payload classic
Overwatch,not_removed,hanzo should really have a spray that says thanks zarya

Overwatch,not_removed,try quick scoping with her sometime it really helps when getting a final blow to help your team or getting a quick heal off on someone when needed most the hitscan for scoped shots means you wont have to lead the shot which is nice though youll want to shoot from the hip more often when healing teammates
Overwatch,not_removed,im powered up get in there grandma finally going senile
Overwatch,not_removed,jeff pls
Overwatch,not_removed,yourepoweredupgetinthere

Overwatch,not_removed,shokk
Overwatch,not_removed,yeah youre definitely right i started working on this last week and knew that it was already getting stale but i liked how it turned out regardless
Overwatch,not_removed,lol the anthem of solo genji mains everywhere
Overwatch,not_removed,thats okay ill turn up the volume upload hours remix on repeat ad nauseam everyone reposts want the fake points on them man thats awesome
Overwatch,not_removed,gonna take you out with an over used meme

Overwatch,not_removed,touche it does make it funnier whenever i hear ana say that line in game to a pharah i always think bedtime ya bish
Overwatch,not_removed,i dont want you to be frustrated with me but you know itll be interesting to see your reactions that are rather iffy
Overwatch,not_removed,i went to ow subreddit my iq dropped all ur dead memes its time to stop

Overwatch,not_removed,lul nice censor btw git good edit im sure next time blizzard tries to match him against other
Overwatch,not_removed,get out
Overwatch,not_removed,i think she might be looking for a working version of the or guns
Overwatch,not_removed,branford is one of the whitest names in human history and the previous doomfist is not that so its much more likely that its a roboticsterm probably a weaponmount
Overwatch,not_removed,thats my guess the is depicted with a full arm variant of the doomfist
Overwatch,not_removed,the hell did you say to me
Overwatch,not_removed,the video versions sound effects are not safe for work httpsclipstwitchtvpaulinkhilariousponyosfrog
Overwatch,not_removed,paulink is a famous redditor
Overwatch,not_removed,are you the hanzo player of the year
Overwatch,not_removed,defense matrix used to be a second duration with a second cooldown right now if you use defense matrix for all seconds it will still take seconds for it to fully recharge
Overwatch,not_removed,okay so question for how it was before you were not able to reuse the defense matrix while under cooldown correct
Overwatch,not_removed,press ability duration seconds wait seconds for cooldown press ability nbsp you can use it again sooner now but it nothing fundamentally changed about how it works just how often you can press the button
Overwatch,not_removed,okay thanks for informing me
Overwatch,not_removed,uh whats the problem
Overwatch,not_removed,are you high diamond near masters
Overwatch,not_removed,do you remember the exact average number though was there that much difference
Overwatch,not_removed,try playing during prime time if its that much of a deal to you
Overwatch,not_removed,scott mercer says when we do put you in a match that we know isnt a we adjust your sr gain or loss based on your calculated change of winning so if you did get placed into a match with only a chance to win and then you lose you shouldnt lose much sr nbsp if you never had a chance to begin with you wouldnt lose any sr if you were not supposed to win and you did you would reap astronomical rewards
Overwatch,not_removed,i was about to say if you are high diamond that seems pretty fair but did you look at your team and their teams sr
Overwatch,not_removed,thats a fucking sweet zaryareaper combo good shit my man
Overwatch,not_removed,if you dont care about doing well then just dont play ranked dont insult people for wanting to do well at their hobby or for being angry when you go into a competitive atmosphere and choose not to play competitively
Overwatch,not_removed,no you clearly want to belittle players for taking the game seriously you did it in your post you deleted telling me you couldnt wait to crush me only to turn around and say i just want people to have fun people have fun playing competitively people have fun winning still only the best at a video game is still just insulting people who enjoy playing the game in a competitive atmosphere whoever got mad at you tonight for playing perfect with the skills of a thousand isnt on this sub isnt reading your post and is indeed calmed in the boobs youve just taken to the overwatch subforum to implicitly insult the entirety of the player base to make yourself feel better im just saying chill out
Overwatch,not_removed,but i didnt mention that in the first sentence
Overwatch,not_removed,congrats
Overwatch,not_removed,submit a ticket to blizzard customer service not reddit if you think something was removed from your profile
Overwatch,not_removed,because she would be absurd with good mobility
Overwatch,not_removed,im trying to get away from mei not have her outrun me as well thats nightmare fuel
Overwatch,not_removed,because shed slip and start rolling shed become a big snowball then kill the whole enemy team while simultaneously winning the objective
Overwatch,not_removed,what time zone
Overwatch,not_removed,i think we need the number in your battletag too also eu or na
Overwatch,not_removed,i would play with you but sadly i am nowhere near you time zone eest good luck on finding people to play with though i also recommend getting a mic pretty quick because it is alot easier to communicate in the in game chat or discord
Overwatch,not_removed,yeah they should just drop and drag some of that long payload run out drag one of the ends in ya know use that colour pick thingy to copy the same colours from the image then select that spray can tool type thing and airbrush some new textures in problem solved
Overwatch,not_removed,thank you
Overwatch,not_removed,i think the use of the simplistic font is due to it being more legible and for quick glances at the kill feed its a much more legible font to read if we take your font as an example some one that glances at the kill feed very quickly might mistake the for a b where as with the original font there is no room for mistakes sometimes you have to account for user experience and not just the graphic design
Overwatch,not_removed,good idea i know ill accidentally press the wrong one but it would be nice to have the feature
Overwatch,not_removed,get curse it over lays

Overwatch,not_removed,everything can be boop
Overwatch,not_removed,i love this looks nice
Overwatch,not_removed,except for beeps beeps cant be boops
Overwatch,not_removed,hack the boop
Overwatch,not_removed,i dont have a second account but im a bit over level so i could easily fuel two accounts with that i have a regular job but i play since release and i do so regularly hours a day after work more on weekends it doesnt take much honestly i assume the same goes for people with multiple accounts now why would someone have a second account at all is what i ask myself just for the noobstomping is everyone a famous youtuber really whats the point someone tell me
Overwatch,not_removed,the great thing is you get nothing from playing long on one account at level you unlock every mode in this game so you can spend your time on whatever account you wish without missing progress
Overwatch,not_removed,i dont have two accounts and im not even high level on one but i can tell you that i play different games for like hours a day more on weekends the secret is not to sleep much hours usually and dont do much beside playing in general all i do in the week is play games and spend one day during weekend to hang out with gf and my friends
Overwatch,not_removed,they dont have a job maybe or they are doing nothing else
Overwatch,not_removed,weekends
Overwatch,not_removed,do you mainly just play overwatch im always amazed how overleveled players are in overwatch titanfall and gta v but i guess if you play it regularly and its you only game how you get there i play games probably two hours a day monfriday and six on weekends but im always switching it up every week
Overwatch,not_removed,smurfing usually is the reason can be cancer from what i understand
Overwatch,not_removed,do you mainly just play overwatch its currently my most played but its far from the only game i play although to be fair being single leaves me with a lot of time on my hands so gamings pretty much all i do once i get off work
Overwatch,not_removed,youre wrong and an idiot

Overwatch,not_removed,add me too psn xaicarl
Overwatch,not_removed,man i got one of those for christmas i think its pretty obvious how that christmas was
Overwatch,not_removed,i like the idea of a contactjuggling zenyatta even though he specifically says he will not juggle but dont associate it with the fushigi company who trick people into thinking that they invented contact juggling and that its easy to learn
Overwatch,not_removed,if its anything like the commercials then it must have been an amazing time
Overwatch,not_removed,thats the thing it was nothing like the commercials all the tricks are done by masters and have camera magic
Overwatch,not_removed,to be fully honest why should you give a single shit if some nameless and faceless person on the internet is mad at you i have played league for years and so far what ive seen in ow is toxicity in its baby shoes still i didnt reach diamond talking shit about every person who did sub par in any game thick skin and a good humour is what you want to have agains ragers make them look like an idiot with a good joke or call them something unusual which has no connection to the situation my personal favourite is to call flamers buckets d
Overwatch,not_removed,i agree this game has toxic players and nice players but i feel like many players are coming from the casual side of wow and simply can not handle anything but a gentle pat on the back
Overwatch,not_removed,my goto insult is horsefucking cockbat no one can make heads or tails of that one
Overwatch,not_removed,i appretiate your thought process
Overwatch,not_removed,yeah a big ddos is going on right now mostly because of the wow release

Overwatch,not_removed,yep see httpstwittercomblizzardcs
Overwatch,not_removed,it is funny because it is true i wish my badass mech would do more damage than my little gun
Overwatch,not_removed,that pistol combined with the tiny hit box makes me wish you could eject on command shes great fun to play out of suit
Overwatch,not_removed,soldier oh no mercy oh no dva oh yeahhhhhh
Overwatch,not_removed,unleash the hana
Overwatch,not_removed,seeing as her hands stick out from under her mech she may as well just use her pistol from inside the cockpit does more damage and has better range then those useless cannons
Overwatch,not_removed,the armor i use to seal my all too powerful strenght is now broken
Overwatch,not_removed,this is so real every single dva ive ever faced gets more deadly out of the mech somehow
Overwatch,not_removed,i sometimes stay in human mode when my call mech is charged just because the handgun is so strong
Overwatch,not_removed,i get more kills outside of my mech
Overwatch,not_removed,mercys gun turns out to be pretty damn good as well i have killed multiple people who thought i was an easy target with it
Overwatch,not_removed,she should just stick those mini guns to the meka instead would probably do more damage
Overwatch,not_removed,one of my favorite things in the world is killing that mech and snagging dva out of the air with chain hook when she pops out
Overwatch,not_removed,playing zenyatta lol this dva is pushing guys rip her mech destroyed oh god soomeone please help
Overwatch,not_removed,i got a potg the other day for finishing off a wounded hanzo with my mech right as he destroyed it then taking on a soldier and killing him with my adadadad spam everyone apparently thought it was hilarious saying things like dva and were all apm lords now but i just felt embarrassed that i got my fullhealth mech destroyed by a lowhealth hanzo but hey that pistol can output some serious damage if you chain headshots
Overwatch,not_removed,yeah sadly this is so very true watch the trailer and be all omg i can be an awesome high speed mech pilot and then this i love her but the mech feels so useless atm on foot dva is so much more dangerous where are those buffs
Overwatch,not_removed,this is not even my final form
Overwatch,not_removed,as a dva main i approve this comic d
Overwatch,not_removed,actually her pistol is my favorite weapon of the game am i weird
Overwatch,not_removed,here have a manual upvote too ↑
Overwatch,not_removed,reaper is so cute
Overwatch,not_removed,ya i feel the same way when a sniper manages to pop me out of my mechi can chase them off with some dodging and my pistol almost better than flying at them w defense matrix which just lets them run off before i can finish them and setup elsewhere
Overwatch,not_removed,once on temple of anubis i flew over a wall and got stuck in the niche in front of point b with the little health pack with a junk rat and road hog they destroyed my much i jumped around spastically and killed junk rat got a new mech which was destroyed instantly jump speraticaly around some more dosging hooks and got a second mech this time i was able to fly away i typed in all chat muauauahhhahaha i liiive the road hog responded with i dont thinknk have ever missed so many shots as just now before
Overwatch,not_removed,its true some characters can reliably destroy her mech but then are almost always killed by her pilot form
Overwatch,not_removed,i feel like they could fix dva by letting us exitenter the bot whenever we want
Overwatch,not_removed,love it although is a great way to counter hoppy squishy dorks
Overwatch,not_removed,yknow dvas mech was made for the korean military but i swear that she is the korean military for being able to deploy them so much
Overwatch,not_removed,as a mccree this is what i save my flashbang for
Overwatch,not_removed,itd be cool if you could eject at will and the mech would either follow you around or went sentry mode
Overwatch,not_removed,match i had yesterday was in mech vs out of it and holy shit it was a party good red team comp kept a lot of pressure on me but once i wasnt roboed up it was like they didnt know how to handle the gremlin that had been unleashed melee kills headshots galore kill streak etc i contemplated going the rest of the match without my mech but thatd be kind of silly even if it was just quick play my team and i were having a ball
Overwatch,not_removed,now i need to remake that evangeline rebuild scene where the eva breaks free from its restraints and goes insane in he enemy
Overwatch,not_removed,i almost prefer being mechless dva headshots with that pew pew fuck people up gud
Overwatch,not_removed,i also find that other players are able to fire dvas pisol so much faster than i can its like pewpewpewpewpewpewpew and me its like pewpewpewpew
Overwatch,not_removed,last night i actually waited a bit to call my mech because i was hitting so many longrange pistol shots that thing is deadly and is better than having the mech in some situations
Overwatch,not_removed,this is so very true unless we are in immidiate need of a tank i often just stay in true form for a short extra while that gun does rediculous damage at long range if you can aim
Overwatch,not_removed,i am a fan of this
Overwatch,not_removed,i like this form of hers its a one shot form really this gremlin outside of its den was never problem to me
Overwatch,not_removed,i love this also just being naked dva and shooting around the point usually lands hits and its like damage youll get in there after a little and start sweeping up kills then you can call another mech dvas pretty cool
Overwatch,not_removed,i wasted a roadhog with my pistol the other day in like seconds then his little friends genji and torb bet they wished id stayed in my mech
Overwatch,not_removed,i agree except if reinhardt destroyed the mech because by the time dva disengages from the mech a hammer is rapidly closing in on her head
Overwatch,not_removed,heeeey thats not a gremlin
Overwatch,not_removed,when i play junkrat i just spam nades at the mech even after its dead to get her with splash damage then finish her off with a mine
Overwatch,not_removed,die die dieeee
Overwatch,not_removed,and because as a released dva i tend to jump around and fire so damn erratically that its like well a child on a doritos and mountain dew diet its a completely valid strategy
Overwatch,not_removed,am i the only one around here that just flat out ignores her if there is anything else i could be doing likeif theres a symettra turret i prioritize even that over killing this annoying little childits too frustrating to try and kill her with the characters i generally choose
Overwatch,not_removed,ironically the easiest way to kill her for me is with reaper
Overwatch,not_removed,suggestion for dva make her ult be stages first q press sets up detonation second bails out secondly make her able to shoot while boosting suddenly her ult isnt garbage and she can actually shoot at people point blank for at least a second
Overwatch,not_removed,videos in this thread videocomment oh yessss i find it absurd when compared to dragon quest im a bot working hard to help redditors find related videos to watch httpsnpredditcomrsubtletvwikimentionedvideos get it on httpschromegooglecomwebstoredetailmentionedvideosforreddfiimkmdalmgffhibfdjnhljpnigcmohf httpsaddonsmozillaorgenusfirefoxaddonmentionedvideosforreddit
Overwatch,not_removed,not that this is controversial pretty well accept actually but dvas hitbox out of her mech is fucking bullshit
Overwatch,not_removed,at last after years im free
Overwatch,not_removed,there are nets in this game i would love a tracer catching net hello new character idea
Overwatch,not_removed,i always feel like such a killjoy when i just casually microwave her as symetra build up the damage on her mech before she ejects and her pilot form just instadies
Overwatch,not_removed,nice
Overwatch,not_removed,doesnt need the explanation is funny
Overwatch,not_removed,zero suit dva is the chosen form of the destructor
Overwatch,not_removed,i was so confusedi was like thats a shotgun not a holy hand grenade
Overwatch,not_removed,as dva gets sorta stunned coming out of the mech landing a rocket on her as soon as she hits the ground kinda makes her a worse hero
Overwatch,not_removed,so much truth
Overwatch,not_removed,i actually get more kills as zero suit dva
Overwatch,not_removed,one thing i really love when playing symmetra is my ability to charge up on a dying mech then immediately kill dva before she can cause chaos when i play dva not only do i live longer as dva but i also deal more damage than meka cant wait for the buff to the meka drone personally im hoping for a tighter spread why would you put shotguns on a highly advanced drone any way even after it was gutted to be a mech dva has the reaction time to shootdown projectiles with her defense matrix you ever watch her when you use that shes shooting those projectiles out of the air
Overwatch,not_removed,honestly zero suit dva should just be her own character
Overwatch,not_removed,deadly dorito shrapnel moving at near relativistic speeds baby
Overwatch,not_removed,whenever someone destroys my meka i like to just say you are only making me stronger
Overwatch,not_removed,this is why i hate playing dva it seems she does no damage at all
Overwatch,not_removed,can we remove the mechs fusion cannons and then duct tape dvas light gun instead maybe put some strings on the triggers so hana can shoot inside the mech
Overwatch,not_removed,symmetra here what mech pilot edit for those who dont understand symmetras autolock dps beam vaporizes her the instant she pops out and if there are turrets around well
Overwatch,not_removed,she should just duct tape her pistol to the arms of her mech
Overwatch,not_removed,when my mech gets destroyed im always like fk it im gonna die anyway and start shooting erratically and thats when i get kills
Overwatch,not_removed,its the combination that i love me as winston kill torbjorn turret get shotgunned in the face by torb or take so long killing the turret the whole enemy team is now on me get mad that nobody is shooting the turret that shuts me down constantly me as dva take no damage entering point blank range of turret due to defense matrix kill turret in seconds flat pop out of mech and kill torbjorn from a safe distance with headshots get enough for an ult to nuke torbjorns second turret off objective b
Overwatch,not_removed,a buddy of mine spent like minutes trying to convince me seriously that dva is a really strong hero because she has the fastest ult gain in the game when outside of her mech
Overwatch,not_removed,easy just stay as close to your target that your guns penetrate him already he definitely wont be able to outrun you x
Overwatch,not_removed,i wish she could get an alternate fire where she lifts the blast shield on her meka and fires the pistol it can be balanced by allowing double damage to her while doing so or straight damage to her hp if something like that is possible
Overwatch,not_removed,it does crazy damage at point blank
Overwatch,not_removed,imagine being able to pop out of your mech and it stays wherever you are and you could charge up another one while out if you get good at hiding mechs youd have some back ups thing is your teammate or enemy dvas can take them too
Overwatch,not_removed,mercy is basically same altho with a slightly bigger hitbox
Overwatch,not_removed,seriously have you seen that dps for the pistol you could melt roadhog with one clip to the head
Overwatch,not_removed,introducing zero suit dva
Overwatch,not_removed,
Overwatch,not_removed,
Overwatch,not_removed,now i must listed to black sheep to get it out of my head haha
Overwatch,not_removed,reaper oh no
Overwatch,not_removed,hello again friend of a friend
Overwatch,not_removed,would you say that the meka broke out in song ill see myself out
Overwatch,not_removed,ryuu ga waga teki wo hana hanzo shoots out zerosuit hana from his arrow antmanhawkeye style hana proceeds to wipe entire enemy team on point while shouting winky face
Overwatch,not_removed,
Overwatch,not_removed,she actually uses her mech for the safety of the other team
Overwatch,not_removed,i guess i need to watch one punch man because i automatically thought of bui from yu yu hakusho
Overwatch,not_removed,i think its because dva suddenly becomes very accurate at medium range so people dont react accordingly when theyre too used to her being short range
Overwatch,not_removed,i generally stay in pilot form until someone starts focusingchasing me then switch to meka form to turn it around on them once they over commit
Overwatch,not_removed,yeah this is actually a legit strategy if theres no one on the pointcart you can do a lot more damage at range with little dva
Overwatch,not_removed,one of these days im gonna use the call mech to kill someone kirby stomp style
Overwatch,not_removed,yeah its actually pretty situational i dont call down the mech immediately if i see use for her high midrange dps
Overwatch,not_removed,i get more deaths outside of my mech wait a minute
Overwatch,not_removed,say ah
Overwatch,not_removed,its so satisfying too when a tracer or genji just strolls up thinking youre an easy kill
Overwatch,not_removed,yeah in many respects mercy can be treated like a better version of dva when out of her mech their pistols are pretty similar mercys does more damage per hit dvas fires faster and honestly while it doesnt always pay off im not that afraid of the or less heroes and will engage them if they threaten me also as a side note mercy can pop dvas mech super quick whether thats a good or a bad thing is up to you to decide
Overwatch,not_removed,i got a triple kill at the point with mercy i was healing a and realized that i wasnt going to make it so i switched to pistol in an attempt to take one of them with me got all three of them
Overwatch,not_removed,they would actually be a lot more useful
Overwatch,not_removed,does that mean zero suit dva would get a mechsized gatling shotgun to lug around in return
Overwatch,not_removed,lmb fusion cannons rmb plasma guns id never play any other hero
Overwatch,not_removed,or just killing her by happenstance because hammer
Overwatch,not_removed,
Overwatch,not_removed,tbh soldier does more damage if he can chain headshots as well just spray the origin of their movement the lag compensation and hitboxes will take care of the rest its what i do with dva pistols and anything that doesnt spread
Overwatch,not_removed,she seems to be pretty good as is i honestly dont think she needs a buff i play her a lot and found out a lot about what makes her useful
Overwatch,not_removed,no you are not
Overwatch,not_removed,thanks
Overwatch,not_removed,die die die pilot d va pops out sorry sorry sorry sorry
Overwatch,not_removed,maneuver like a reaper or genji fly to a location that takes you around behind them
Overwatch,not_removed,what do you mean by fix
Overwatch,not_removed,you do know its full auto right
Overwatch,not_removed,i often just stay in true form for a short extra while the best part is that your selfdestruct ultimate starts to charge once your call mech ult is charged i once decided to stick to my pilot form for a good few minutes ended up getting two selfdestruct ults without being in the mech for more than seconds
Overwatch,not_removed,yeahhhhh against symm id rather be in the mech
Overwatch,not_removed,hurtbox
Overwatch,not_removed,that was exactly my thought after playing a couple ai rounds last night unless you are right on top of someone her mech is very weak but once you bust out that pistol you are a killing machineprovided you are light on your feet and keep your distance
Overwatch,not_removed,in some situations i suicide my mech so that i can have a real gun
Overwatch,not_removed,i personally love sniping with dvas pistol ive killed a few torbjorn and bastions defending on anubis because they either just refuse to move or they only decide to move when ive already let off enough shots to end them
Overwatch,not_removed,i switched to dva on anubis payload against two torbs bastion reinhardt pharah and genji boosted up to get the turret and bastion off the payload ejected crouched down and started shooting out turrets and ankles from beneath the payload
Overwatch,not_removed,me as dva take no damage entering point blank range of turret due to defense matrix kill turret in seconds flat pop out of mech and kill torbjorn from a safe distance with headshots i rarely looses turret as dwarf to dva two rmb and mech is gone and turret is really good at targeting pilot d
Overwatch,not_removed,you need to play against some better torbjorns ill shotgun your mech to hell before you get the turret down then youre stuck dealing with both me and the turret while your skinny ass futilely tries to dodge edit oh looks like we have some salty bastards in here edit seriously people wow i know there some serious torb hate here but the issues usually arise when hes stacked hes pretty balanced solo and i personally like to take advantage of typical player behaviors a single torb is not that hard to take out if hes not covered by his team i play with a good team of people and dont camp the turret the whole time a team that knows how to apply pressure wil drop the turrets and never let them back up in fact thats usually my roll on offence i will play pharah or junkrat and focus on breaking the defensive wall the key is learning the maps learning where the choke points are and the most effective ways to break them without getting taken out classes are made to be strong in their respective roles some are stronger than others note i also play on pc where torb isnt a gib win like on console
Overwatch,not_removed,you know i rather like dva though her gun does do crap damage but her ult gain inside the mech is soooo slow because you spend so much of your time charging your mech personally that my main problem with her
Overwatch,not_removed,i may be wrong but im quite sure if you charge up meka call but die before using it youll keep your ult charge as self destruct when you respawn need to test it
Overwatch,not_removed,thered just be forty at the base because people would only play her dps
Overwatch,not_removed,we titanfall now
Overwatch,not_removed,that would be dope
Overwatch,not_removed,this makes me wonderwhere do dvas mechs come from is there just a huge airship full of mechs that hovers high above the battlefield wherever dva is
Overwatch,not_removed,if they do let you purposely eject id imagine that you wouldnt be able to stockpile them since you could just hide an army in your base what they could do though is since your meka is still alive it could continue to charge your nuke ultimate and if someone does find and destroy your meka you then start charging your meka callin ultimate
Overwatch,not_removed,and a sign above her head saying hey kill me before everyone else
Overwatch,not_removed,her rate of fire is slower though but individuals shot does more damage i think d vas gun is still better though
Overwatch,not_removed,diva does flips and her model moves more erraric though
Overwatch,not_removed,was playing d va for the first time last night and a roadhog hooked me and destroyed my mech i immedieately started shooting at his head and he was dead in seconds then i did the exact same thing to kill him again a minute or two later way faster than with the mech
Overwatch,not_removed,someone photoshop kool aid guy with dva mech please
Overwatch,not_removed,damnit take my upvote and go you monster
Overwatch,not_removed,hana ga waka teki wo kurau which translates to let the hana consume my enemies
Overwatch,not_removed,zerosuit hana now im imagining dva in zero suit samus outfit
Overwatch,not_removed,while shouting winky face it tilts the enemy you see
Overwatch,not_removed,yea but pretty much everyone can just walk out of her effective range before they do much damage
Overwatch,not_removed,yeahim not sure why roadhogs hook me i just smack them with my melee and then hold left mouse click
Overwatch,not_removed,but i really dont know why pick dva for such play style tracer and genji do that job dashing to enemies and quickly bursting them down before fleeing much much better imo and unlike dva can easily linger behind enemy lines constantly doing damage dvas huge mech gets spotted instantly so her flanking is more like fly in kill maybe one dude and fly out that doesnt sound too effective
Overwatch,not_removed,i dont get the complaints about her jump jetting into people and shooting them is pretty much a guaranteed kill as long as they arent mei not to mention your ability to bully people with the jump jets is insane
Overwatch,not_removed,but if you fly in there you wont be fly out to escape and probably die
Overwatch,not_removed,yep i almost always die when i hook the enemy dva no idea why i keep doing it
Overwatch,not_removed,better version
Overwatch,not_removed,
Overwatch,not_removed,people also ignore squishva for some reason its like if suddenly people started ignoring a slightly worse because oh she could never kill me and shell die in like hits then i use their soon to be corpse to fill my ult and it doesnt matter that i was at becasue now im at full hp inside a giant fuckoff mech thats the best part about dva you get to play super aggressively because youre essentially immortal
Overwatch,not_removed,when im at long range ill stay in pilot form once the enemy closes then i go back to meka
Overwatch,not_removed,you can die in your mech if you fall off the map in some games thats the only way i die
Overwatch,not_removed,httpsstreamablecomcsyl
Overwatch,not_removed,thats because your mechs head is the size of the moon
Overwatch,not_removed,yes
Overwatch,not_removed,whenever she fires shed not only be slower shed actually get pushed backwards
Overwatch,not_removed,this is the buff she needs
Overwatch,not_removed,everyone does more damage if you chain head shots for those who can do so its just surprising how much damage dva can do with her pistol
Overwatch,not_removed,i love everything playing dva when your flair is on my team and they give me all the shields bahahahahahahahaha
Overwatch,not_removed,sorry sorry im sorry sorry
Overwatch,not_removed,ya i do my best to be an agile tank but sometimes they have their back to a wallcorner and theres little you can do but at least rush them out of there so they stop pinging your team i just wish we had better postengagement pursuit
Overwatch,not_removed,well the community has been saying shes underpowered i agree that her meka is a bit squishy and her ult takes so long to explode only idiots end up dying from it though its really good at clearing a waypoint i personally think that without changing her damage or hitpoints she could be buffed by just letting people eject from the meka whenever they want and reenter the meka when you eject the meka would be a squishy wall this would add a totally new dimension to her gameplay
Overwatch,not_removed,wut that would explain a lot
Overwatch,not_removed,seriously holy crap til im suddenly a lot less eager to get back in the safety of my mech
Overwatch,not_removed,what wait really are you sure about this ive never heard of it before but holy shit i think i need to test it asap
Overwatch,not_removed,it only charges at the natural passive charge rate you dont get charge for damage dealt
Overwatch,not_removed,ive had more than a few situations where ive ulted and then spent the next minute gunning people down before i realized i could call a new mech usually when i see pharahs come back again
Overwatch,not_removed,anubis payload
Overwatch,not_removed,til you can crouch in ow
Overwatch,not_removed,youre probably right hey why even get involved with the fight at all just pop molten core and then go make a cup of tea while your turret does all your aardvark for you you knobheaded swedish gnome signed a reaper main
Overwatch,not_removed,oh wow you are so cool please inform us on how easily you ruin the fun for everyone while i take notes
Overwatch,not_removed,yeah i have a lot of fun playing her but having a hard time deciding if shes just crap or im just crap
Overwatch,not_removed,that and the actual ultimate itself is preeeety lackluster junkrats ultimate charges faster and has more impact
Overwatch,not_removed,thatd be stupid as hell yes pilot dva can be super fun and its the contrast between the mech and the pilot thats really fun too but come on pilot dva on her own is easily the worst hero in the game only reason why she feels so good is that you have nothing to lose youre only trying to do enough damage to get your mech back still being able to eject on command for clutch pseudosniping or whatnot could be a lot of fun
Overwatch,not_removed,i am okay with this
Overwatch,not_removed,is it really worth it running all the way back to base though by that time you could have probably just charged another mech while fighting going back to base for another one would just be a detriment to your team that would only really work on attack on payload maps and only for the first part of the map or for the end for the defending team
Overwatch,not_removed,me playing mercy dammit i wish theyd stop killing me first when i see an enemy mercy kill that blonde bitch
Overwatch,not_removed,mercy is slightky higher dps much higher damage per magazine and slower projecticle dva is faster rof so it is more forgiving
Overwatch,not_removed,her projectiles feel like they travel slower too but youre usually gunning down someone whos in your face so that doesnt matter as much but sometimes youre countersniping
Overwatch,not_removed,yeah its amazing i get hooked by roadhog start gunning him he kills my mech and im like ha jokes on you cant hit me now with my super small model and then shoot him in the head kill him and get a new mech
Overwatch,not_removed,httpiimgurcomhfwfnaxpng
Overwatch,not_removed,gremlin dva breaking out of her meka holding a liter bottle of mountain dew code red
Overwatch,not_removed,damn weab u must be genji main s
Overwatch,not_removed,someone always has to be that guy today you are that guy
Overwatch,not_removed,i get the opposite experience unless i can somehow sneak right to a roadhog hes probably going to grab me and empty a full body meatshot right into my crit box thus completely negating any health i may have had his burst damage is insane
Overwatch,not_removed,because if all is right roadhog gets the first action and you have a massive head hitbox can easily shoot from afar pull shoot up close and melee to immediately take a dva out of her mech
Overwatch,not_removed,dva is different from tracergenjireaper theyre all flankers but not all flanking is the same dva is good at pulling units out of position and giving your team advantages reaper hovers around just beyond the front line and kills tanks that are out of position which gives your team an opportunity to push genjis and tracers specifically fly around and kill high priority targets like mercy in order to keep a team from always having an optimal composition you could almost look at it in the sense that reapergenjitracer are built to take advantage of the chaos that dva creates
Overwatch,not_removed,roadhogs altfire does insane damage to dva especially since hooking her practically aligns her for an easy headshot but it is really on whoever is the most prepared two huge targets both with weapons designed to shred huge targets i can think of better things to hook as roadhog
Overwatch,not_removed,i dont have this issue playing roadhog two shots should break her mech shell do some damage to you though but you should win and snap her mech heal up then break her face
Overwatch,not_removed,never happens to me hook shotgun melee shotgun
Overwatch,not_removed,i always save my hook so i can use it on her outofmech form immediately i dont play around when it comes to roadhog vs other tanks
Overwatch,not_removed,exactly its like meh someone will accidentally kill her while shooting someone else but they underestimate that naked dva has a hitbox thats always facing degrees away from you
Overwatch,not_removed,and boosters combined with their knockback ability will get you out of almost literally any situation
Overwatch,not_removed,people ignore you when youre out of your mech i wish my enemies were like that as soon as i pop out of my mech i seem to become their highest priority target ive had many people usewaste their ult on me even though they had a very clear shot to use it on my team
Overwatch,not_removed,i thought it ejected her then she died
Overwatch,not_removed,
Overwatch,not_removed,oh yeah i know its actually one of the main things that convinced me dva really needs a buff i even did the math on it accounting for the damage reduction from armour assuming you get all headshots not difficult at mediumclose range you can pop a full health mech in just under seconds i do not feel i should be able to do that so easily
Overwatch,not_removed,thats no moon
Overwatch,not_removed,sweet a mobility buff
Overwatch,not_removed,so you shoot backwards and use the kick to move super fast
Overwatch,not_removed,oh i didnt mean to be an ass although reading my post makes me sound like one i was just going to talk about aiming in the center of adad spam if its not wide enough youll easily murder the other player because of the help netcode provides
Overwatch,not_removed,i use boosters to chase after reaper they recharge fast enough and ive surprised many who thought i would have given up the chase defense matrix should buy you time to recharge boosters to escape too
Overwatch,not_removed,i think that might leave to some other problems though the way she uses her mech as a second chance is one of her best attributes she might as well not be a tank without it its why she has more staying power as well you get your mech killed and you can either run off or take out an enemy that usually underestimates you i dont think being able to leave the mech when ever would actually improve her
Overwatch,not_removed,yeah every weapon in overwatch can be fired without by just holding the mouse down even if it seems like its wouldnt
Overwatch,not_removed,its actually so powerful that gun you can take out an unshielded bastion from the other side of a map in seconds if youre not being shot at how many other heroes can do that at long range that fast
Overwatch,not_removed,its slower but yeah it still charges
Overwatch,not_removed,this is true and im glad they gave her a pistol that is so powerful outside of her mech
Overwatch,not_removed,mercys pistol does that damage dva does slightly less dps soldier will do more in of situations though
Overwatch,not_removed,or when you finally decide to go push the payload again begrudgingly
Overwatch,not_removed,this guy on some next level ptr invite only shit
Overwatch,not_removed,sorry its the one with the doomfist numbani has lots of little ramps on the roadway that makes this work it was at the second to last corner too
Overwatch,not_removed,honestly one of the few times where is was useful zenyatta floats lower which amusing when hes pinned behind the payload
Overwatch,not_removed,not always for example dvas meka cant crouch
Overwatch,not_removed,sadly crouch jumping still not a thing
Overwatch,not_removed,i actually like to split the field with my turret so to engage it you have to give me your back i play very aggressively with torbjorn and typically use the turret more as a distractiondeterrent it presents the highest visible threat and leaves attackers wide open to me flanking them at close range the shotgun melts tanks and they are usually too busy fighting the turret to notice if they do turn around the turret shreds them i also try to place my turret that covers an area without being directly exposed to the line of advance it means you have to now break out into my teams controlled space to attack it you cant just easily shoot it from range i force you into my killbox
Overwatch,not_removed,wow just wow so playing a class well means you ruin the fun for everyone else cry more
Overwatch,not_removed,depends on what youre using her for i love playing her too but ive found shes terrible for things like trying to hold a point or escort a payload shes a huge slow when using her guns target in her meka and melts immediately under focused fire shes also very easy to hit with things like reinhardts charge or roadhogs hook where she really shines is sniper hunting boost defense matrix means you can usually get right on top of a widow or hanzo without taking any damage and theyll have a really hard time dealing with you at that point i love hunting down nesting widows a lot of the time theyre so focused on their scope that they dont even notice the huge robot flying in from the side
Overwatch,not_removed,so dva despite being grouped into the tank category is a flanking harasser you can user her as a tank but roadhog or reinhardt are just going to make better damage soakers until someone fixes her ridiculous crit box that can be hit by a full clip by a standing at max range while a ten year old plays him i may be a little salty about how paper thin her mech seems dva functions the best when paired with another dva or another tank one from the front and then dva from the back and you can just ruin anyones day boost in nab their flankers on their way out boost out rinse repeat kill the flankers who make it past you by camping your mercy after boosting back into your team there is nothing better than watching a genji come around the corner to kill mercy and doing a wave emote at him while you wait for his reflexive reflect to ware off and then just unloading in his face boosting him into a corner and then unloading in his face again and if a flanker ults you can boost out providing mercy an arch angel target to latch onto so she doesnt get ultd in the face you are the anti flanker who is also capable of harassing the entire other team like a flanker its glorious
Overwatch,not_removed,once you realise shes fat tracer you should start doing better
Overwatch,not_removed,hardly junkrats tire is really easy to destroy sure it is easy to avoid dvas mech but you still have to leave the area and it is an incredible way to clear an objective junkrats tire is loud as fuck easy to kill and he is a sitting duck while controlling it so unless you are at your own spawn or playing against a team with zero flankers junkrat is probably dead by the time you are done ulting sure there are definitely ways to use his tire effectively driving up against a wall to idle the engine for a second to make it quieter can help climbing over walls and killing from above can help but the simple fact is that dvas ult will always be helpful whether it kills someone or not it will clear the objective for several seconds junkrats ult can certainly have more impact but it can also have literally zero impact like when a pharah spams her rockets and instantly kills it
Overwatch,not_removed,im just joking i do think shes quite strong in the right hands though infuriatingly slippery against the right champs and the dps is really up there but youre right half the fun is the mentality of fuck it i already lost the mech
Overwatch,not_removed,its also her recovery ability take enough damage and you get a damage boost then if you do enough damage you get your mech back eg selfheal and powerup
Overwatch,not_removed,being able to eject on command to hide a mech for a delayed ult would be both genius and insanity
Overwatch,not_removed,nothing better than a mercy on mercy pistol brawl screw healing this bitch is mine
Overwatch,not_removed,mercy ones are about slower from my crude tests
Overwatch,not_removed,holy shit ahahaha
Overwatch,not_removed,youre truly making this world a better place
Overwatch,not_removed,this is too good i think it deserves its own post
Overwatch,not_removed,dva loses the pointblank fight to roadhog and reinhardt those crit hammer smashes in the face just end her
Overwatch,not_removed,hes probably going to grab me and empty a full body meatshot right into my crit box ooh
Overwatch,not_removed,defense matrix as soon as you get off the hook and then set up for a favorable fight
Overwatch,not_removed,when in doubt fly straight upward and then ideally over a building or around a corner or right around into their back
Overwatch,not_removed,this is what happens to me get hooked get wrecked if defense matrix isnt up then jump out of the mech and ruin roadhog so he has to go hide and heal by then i almost have my mech back just from doing damage to him
Overwatch,not_removed,i wonder how often those enemies had a lot of time playing dva its like second nature to me hunting her down after i take out the meka because i know exactly what happens if i dont
Overwatch,not_removed,fair enough
Overwatch,not_removed,yea reapers usually an easy kill my concern is more often widowhanzos
Overwatch,not_removed,mercy does the job as well though not as fast
Overwatch,not_removed,i love the light pistol only issue is that the only times that the enemy team manages to get me out of my mech im surrounded and theres a reinhardt on standby ready to play whackamole or the enemy team has a winston that id really rather not get zapped by
Overwatch,not_removed,there still needs to be a slight buff though
Overwatch,not_removed,i mean she has no passive no skills no alt fire so her gun has to fill that enough that you can get your mech back
Overwatch,not_removed,numbani
Overwatch,not_removed,you should edit your comment youll get downvoted to hell just because of the accuracy its already marked as a controversial comment on res
Overwatch,not_removed,you make it seem so dramatic youre placing a turret and shooting people please get over yourself
Overwatch,not_removed,the amount of salt in this thread is absurd
Overwatch,not_removed,youre not outlining a strategy youre just saying that youre a great player without describing how
Overwatch,not_removed,nobody cares who you play its just the incredibly douchey tone that your comment has
Overwatch,not_removed,for point holding your job as dva is to dive the enemy healers you basically pull a little reinhardt and push them away from the enemy team and kill them while your team fights the now support less enemies
Overwatch,not_removed,on ilios i love to wait inside the point a for an unsuspecting enemy to walk past the doors on either side then boost bump them off the map
Overwatch,not_removed,for things like trying to hold a point or escort a payload shes great for the final stretch when shit hits the fanbut not a moment before that you want to be in there to do all the ult denials with defense matrix and then self destruct to buy your team like seconds seconds for explosion and then time for the time to regroup at objective
Overwatch,not_removed,there is nothing better than watching a genji come around the corner to kill mercy and doing a wave emote at him while you wait for his reflexive reflect to ware off i so need to start doing that good way of relieving yourself of how annoying he can be stop moving around damnit i can only take step a second while im firing these damn water hoses at you
Overwatch,not_removed,not so fun when on korean servers control point maps are sometimes dominated by dvas and lucio god that is a nightmare to win against
Overwatch,not_removed,they actually makes a lot of sense both about why i love playing her and why im crap at her tracer is my favorite to play and im absolutely garbage with her
Overwatch,not_removed,i have the feeling that junkrats ult is much easier to deal with on pc than console for dvas ult though most contested points come built in with cover either with a giant ass pillar in the center or something right outside its annoying when you only get them to scatter for second before they are back on the point at least junkrats forces the team to go on alert and kill and or spread
Overwatch,not_removed,i disagree the full heal that accompanies getting your mech back is huge your enemies have to get through your defensive matrix your armor health then if you get in enough good shots you can even get hit for another damage a rocket to the face is less than pilots hp and then remech to heal back up to with defensive matrix and boosters both available pilots pistol is one of the best weapons in the game treat it like a plasma rifle from doom
Overwatch,not_removed,why just do a fuck ton of damage while you retreat back behind your allies you can get in some pot shots at range before getting your mech back
Overwatch,not_removed,agreed that or managing to take out a tracer as mercy
Overwatch,not_removed,me everytime i see an enemy mercy
Overwatch,not_removed,youre flair is pretty relevant
Overwatch,not_removed,reinhardt doesnt have crit ability his hammer does damage flat per swing when up close dvas mech gun does dps for headshots which is easy to do against other tanks if you lose to reinhardt at point blank range that is your own fault roadhog on the other hand is a bit more tricky if you cant get around to his side or back before unloading then you just have to unload for three seconds until he destroys your mech and then easily finish him off in zero suit form really though dva should never lose a point blank fight to another tank she is even guaranteed a second chance when the mech is destroyed
Overwatch,not_removed,crit hammer
Overwatch,not_removed,i was waiting for someone to mention that
Overwatch,not_removed,shes really predictable popping out of hte mech if a rightclick doesnt kill her or drop her low i immediately duck in cover if she wants to goof around until my hooks off cd again though thats fine by me
Overwatch,not_removed,very true though a mercy usually has her hands full with the entire team while a true form dva just has to wait for her new mech to arrive
Overwatch,not_removed,isnt her passive that you effectively need to kill her twice
Overwatch,not_removed,so what she dies in like two hits has no movement and doesnt shoot helix rockets
Overwatch,not_removed,i dont edit comments to changeremove something commented upon
Overwatch,not_removed,in a game about shooting people what part of this are you missing
Overwatch,not_removed,i actually did in a lower reply
Overwatch,not_removed,in response to the incredibly whiny reply
Overwatch,not_removed,awesome ive never tried that approach with her on koth but i definitely will next time im online
Overwatch,not_removed,dvas job list be fast and keep your boostshield cooldowns on lock and in good rotation flank snipers flank torbjorn flank healers get in their face disrupt backfield avoid mccree avoid mei move and zigzag like a mfr to keep your massive crit box safe know where all the healthpacks are boost tofrom them and usedeny them constantly ult is crap but is still good at making opponents move off point and get distracted or launching a surprise bastion etc
Overwatch,not_removed,i dont know why but dva is a just nightmarish when in groups its like she suddenly becomes a tank because theres of her baring down on you
Overwatch,not_removed,watches mech immediately get melted when recalled say what now
Overwatch,not_removed,dont get me wrong i do that a lot as well its just not nearly as entertaining
Overwatch,not_removed,just start prefiring down a hall you know the tracers going to take so satisfying hearing dinkdinkdink
Overwatch,not_removed,so what youre saying is mercy is op pls nerf
Overwatch,not_removed,didnt know the hammer didnt crit wish the game told you these things rest of it well i tend to find roadhog just hooks me shoots me shoots again and im out of the mech there isnt even really seconds to go around
Overwatch,not_removed,didnt know it didnt crit
Overwatch,not_removed,note to dva players hit jump and move left or right as you eject if you just land where you normally do people will kill you for it
Overwatch,not_removed,i must be doing a good job then xd my teams always topped off to the point that i can whip out my pistol and shoot baddies for a little bit
Overwatch,not_removed,my point was that as long as shes out of her mech she has nothing but her gun she no longer has lives as she used up already at this point her only ability is to get back into her mech but for that she has nothing but her gun
Overwatch,not_removed,wut
Overwatch,not_removed,just use the strike tag to show the edit surround anubis with and then write numbani afterwards
Overwatch,not_removed,not missing anything youre making my point everyone is shooting guns and youre pretending to be sun tzu and the aardvark of war or some shit
Overwatch,not_removed,sorry on mobile and it doesnt load all replies
Overwatch,not_removed,independent pov no dude this is all you
Overwatch,not_removed,it works best for dva because she punches through the enemy distracts them and unlike reinhardt when she dies shes not dead yet when reinhardt charges without an ult hes just gonna die
Overwatch,not_removed,yeah dude shes meant for booping not shooting
Overwatch,not_removed,its because when there are so many dvas its hard to focus any one down quickly without coordination and then you have a bunch of skinny girls running around even when you destroy them a whole bunch of them can simply outlast most team comps and take the point while the defending team run back dva being super mobile for a tank doesnt hurt either
Overwatch,not_removed,i am saying that she destroys everyone in the weekly brawl
Overwatch,not_removed,your best chance against roadhog is to either sneak up on him or have him hook you from far away if he hooks you from far enough youll be able to activate the defense matrix before he is able to shoot his stun lasts longer than your hook stun if far enough away
Overwatch,not_removed,you dont get it they pop out of hte mech in the same general spot its not hard to whack you there
Overwatch,not_removed,shes fast and has a small model although squishy with hp but her gun is very good with its firing rate and perfect accuracy just have to stay alive long enough to call down another mech
Overwatch,not_removed,which is still insane she gets two lives a super powerful secondary weapon and the ability to regain another healthbar by getting her mech youre complaining that her second life which is triggered after a hp destruction isnt powerful enough come on
Overwatch,not_removed,well the laggy bit is just your computer fast is not true jerky um i guess she can be but so can mercy or any other character thats up to whoever playes it the no damage drop off thing is nice as it allows her to kill things like torb turrets from out of range but its not tooo bad for mobile players as they travel rather slowly maybe if they gave it damage drop off and faster movement it would be ok but i think she is in a nice spot out of mech right now if you really need a problem its widowmaker all the above problems small fast jerky whatever u want no damage drop off one shots most every character but then add in super high mobility and immunity to flanking
Overwatch,not_removed,this whole conversation confused me until i realized i was also confusing those two maps
Overwatch,not_removed,aardvark of war i love it
Overwatch,not_removed,i find her great for the initial push on route that shipping container with a bastion and torbjorn boost out of the gate and defense matrix and elims within seconds of the round starting
Overwatch,not_removed,i guess i needed a s it would still be kind of cool to see how an all mercy team plays out in the brawl
Overwatch,not_removed,well theyre both from the same continent so i guess its fine
Overwatch,not_removed,my team needs an aardvark like u
Overwatch,not_removed,if i used anyone but soldier for attacking it would be mlgva
Overwatch,not_removed,genji gets one shot winston gets headshot during the leap widow grapples away headshots him two more times hanzo can kill her if he is a better player but widow is a better character in general and they just goes with the only counter to a sniper is a better sniper but yeah i totally agree the tick rate is horrible nothing worse than getting to cover two seconds in advance and then getting shot anyway
Overwatch,not_removed,fair enough and wow your good anyways though if widowmaker is that easy to take care of how is dva any worse
Overwatch,not_removed,im a bot if you have any suggestions you can message my creator here
Overwatch,not_removed,literally
Overwatch,not_removed,quality shit post thanks for constructive criticism popular in what quick play bronze high elo meta is tanks supps and soldier or reaper to counter tanks if no dva thanks for trying though tell us who you main that takes so much more skill
Overwatch,not_removed,you literally have to leftclick rightclick or q for the win with any character sometimes asdw helps as well when you sayi experience character x as overpowered do you understand that you have narrow view of games you play and developers get global statistics in real time they see win percentages on all characters and all maps so i bet they have a better picture of which characters do better or worse so relax and wait for the next patch if he is op he will be nerfed
Overwatch,not_removed,original nonpotg
Overwatch,not_removed,this is from beta right
Overwatch,not_removed,i remember that name fliptoe
Overwatch,not_removed,not a beta play i just dug it up on my old hdd apparently its from the of june im just so glad they patched the hitboxes since
Overwatch,not_removed,i front paged here a little while ago with a pharah potg
Overwatch,not_removed,is not that im pretty sure i played with you twice or more that name and hanzo on def if i remember right pharah or genji on atk maybe junkrat
Overwatch,not_removed,five times today i played with an ana that wasnt me four of those times i played with an ana that didnt heal me a single time yes she is a good healer forgive many many people for never ever getting to see that side of her character
Overwatch,not_removed,i tend to find people getting crapped on even in qp even though shes only been out less than a month only a couple weeks even so its good to know that according to some people were not allowed to work at getting better at newer heroes nope just the predetermined best combinations from the original from here on play her as a secondary healer would be a fantastic concept if it wasnt hilarious double support in qp solo queue is a fantasy most times lots of times ive had games where someone chose lucio or mercy and i went oh this is a good chance for a secondary ana and as soon as i chose her they swapped to dps and none of my suggestions for running double support are heeded so if you want to learn ana and do it seriously you almost have to learn to solo heal with her do it efficiently and learn to win that way if youre always waiting for a main healer to play her youd never play her and god forbid trying to do this in comp which i wouldnt because again still trying to learn her
Overwatch,not_removed,she may not be worthless by design but many ana players make her so that was my personal experience with random solohealer anas anyway
Overwatch,not_removed,console ana is the worst and shes in almost every game in level elo hell aiming is garbage andor they spend the whole time shooting at the enemy and never actually do any healing i have never once seen an ana get any card at the end of the game
Overwatch,not_removed,patience dude its like with widowmaker two months ago as a hero she was one of the best but had bad rep due to many players picking multiple widowmakers and proceeding to miss every shot or use only full auto
Overwatch,not_removed,i play alot of reinhardt and when we only have ana in team i sometimes say after we need another healer then ana starts complaining that i do not stay in her los and thats why she can not heal me but in the middle of a fight without good voice communication i can not turn around look where ana is try to stay in her los that would insta kill me at that point i do not care if the ana is good or not when i do not get enough heal to do my job then ana is the wrong pick but then i also had this other games where ana do all she can to stay in my los and i get the heals and it worked then i like ana its still harder without voice com because you never know if you will have the heals when you need or not with a good mercy player i know i can count on the heals
Overwatch,not_removed,her fire rate boost was a really good buff and definitely brought her to around the level of other characters
Overwatch,not_removed,ana is much more of an offensive healer her ult even reflects this by allowing an ally to go on the offensive ana should be played as an off healer alongside another such as zeny
Overwatch,not_removed,i agree i have wins and losses with ana compared to wins and losses with mercy its a team game so maybe ive just had better teams while playing ana but still in my opinion ana is more fun and just as effective as any other healer if not more so besides if everyone else is picking other heroes and leaving me to heal im going to play the one i find most fun and effective if they wanted something different they could pick it
Overwatch,not_removed,ana is not a bad hero but she is bad at defense she also solo heals poorly and is heavily reliant on having a lucio biotic grenade amp it up heal is insane the main reason shes bad at defense is if your opponents have transcendence and sound barrier and all you have is nano boost sound barrier youre going to lose if youre really really good on ana she can do some clutch stuff and maybe in limited situations but only if you are exceptionally good i have only seen ana that would qualify for this at this point people are tired of giving random people a chance i can play this hero just wait and see when half of them then still refuse to switch off or do horribly or it doesnt work out for outlined reasons im tired of losing games because someone wanted us to trust their hanzomei and most other people who play comp are as well picking a bad hero or a hero that is a bad fit either because of counterpicks or mapmap location bias or fits poorly into the team or on wrong side in this case playing ana on defense is the easiest way to crater your team into the ground and whats worse its a conscious choice that players make and have complete control over people are not going to be happy about someone willingly throwing the match and you cant expect them to be edit to add to this the chances that our random pub lucio is going to contribute is insanely high same with zen and if mercy wasnt so overnerfed it would be the case with her as well for ana however theres a good chance she wont contribute anythingvery little so it shouldnt come as a surprise that there is some antiana bias on top of the fact that she needs somewhat specific compsnanoboost targets and attack side to be viable basically shes not nearly as flexible as the other healers and this cant be ignored
Overwatch,not_removed,id rather have a clutch mercylucio ult than an nana boost any day
Overwatch,not_removed,the way i see it is that shes much harder to play than the other healers and requires much more strategy considering some team comps completely waste her abilities
Overwatch,not_removed,i got over healing done with ana yesterday in a payload match
Overwatch,not_removed,not half as good as lucio or zenyatta
Overwatch,not_removed,she can be a good offhealer but she is absolutely no substitute for a lucio or mercy
Overwatch,not_removed,while she may have high hps capabilities the main drawback to choosing ana as a solosupport is that your team misses out on a strong support ult lucio and zen have strong ults for pushing in and mercy can reset bad team fights anas ults usefulness is mostly reliant on her boosted ally picking up kills essentially making it another offensive ult
Overwatch,not_removed,to be fair she was pretty useless before her buffand she still hasnt received that buff on console so until she does get that buff please stay away from her but nowyea she is a respectable choice
Overwatch,not_removed,ill take any other healer please
Overwatch,not_removed,shes a good healer which cant reliably save your team from a bunch of ultis which lucio and zenyatta can simple as that you are giving the enemy team an edge before the game even started would you be pissed if someone picks bastion because he can outdamage other dps too following your logic everyone should be aok with having a bastion on team
Overwatch,not_removed,if ana was crazy good she wouldnt have the lowest win rate she wouldnt have half the healing of lucio and less dps virtually everyone is terrible at her and she is usually the main reason why your team will lose
Overwatch,not_removed,ive never once had an ana out heal me when i played film time healer hell even when i switch halfway through the match i usually end up with gold healing
Overwatch,not_removed,shes not a good solo healer if theres only one support on the team ana is a bad choice
Overwatch,not_removed,whenever i play ana and intend to heal people it is a nightmare because my teammates go rambo on the flanks get low on hp and dont come back to get healed if you watch high skill streamers play they pretty much stay together as a unit and have or maybe people branch off to flank and when those flankers get low they go back to where they know is in line of sight of the ana the ana will stay behind the main unit in safety but in solo queue people arent understanding that you need to play around your ana
Overwatch,not_removed,ana can totally be a main healer after the buff she just received if you watch any high skill team play with her then you could see this her problem isnt healing output she can output more hps than lucio and mercy right now
Overwatch,not_removed,and mccrees not as reliable a dps as winston symmetra or torbjorn because he can miss which is why we call him a secondary dps and make sure to have torb on every team before adding a mccree if theres only the mccree he should switch to torb its not as though ana is only barely capable of outhpsing mercy or something either anas got to miss half her shots or worse to output less healing than mercy worse heals then zenyatta please youd have to be drunk off your ass to get outhealed by him even with his ult you actually have to hit or less shots per to lose to his orbs healing his ultimate exists sure but youd need to have some serious balls to talk about consistency and then try to bring an ult into the conversation you cannot compare anas averages on these sites to other characters you know who picked up the game on launch and picked lucio mercy and zenyatta out of the entire roster available to them people who wanted to play support you know who picked up ana when she came out fucking everybody weve had over months to play the other supports for people to say i like this and i want to get good at this or this just isnt for me lots of us have had even longer watching the closed beta videos and getting a feel for the different strategies and abilities of each character all of those play into the characters average stats but beyond that just look at the average damage done by mccree and torbjorn mccrees got an average damage per game of notice that torbs is at well i guess that settles it doesnt it torbs just the better more reliable more consistent pick than mccree
Overwatch,not_removed,saying ana is unreliable because she has the potential to miss a shot is a bit silly hitboxes are extremely generous on allies and its pretty hard to miss them even when theyre jumping all over the place takes a bit of practice sure but its definitely reliable she is more than capable of solo healing
Overwatch,not_removed,this seems like something you could complain about with mercy and zenyatta as well since they have to target you too
Overwatch,not_removed,yeah really i play with friends and one of them seems to have a quiet hate on for ana and i dont know why hes always pointing out when we have ana as our sole support as if its a bad thing but hes curiously quiet when its me as the sole ana his dislike of ana pisses me off a little simply because he refuses to acknowledge how amazing her single target healing is and when you throw off a grenade when youre already healing youre getting a burst heal that nobody else can beat initially since lucios amp it up will overtake it after seconds he also bitches about ana having better dps than widowmaker solely as a sniper but thats a whole different can of worms right there ana as a whole generally has my most rounded wl ratio when factoring in time played per hero and i feel more effective with her than the other supports except on control maps where lucio is a god
Overwatch,not_removed,my replies to trying to play ana and it resulting in a loss is always you ruined the entire moral of the team its your fault we lost because they spent the entire first minutes bitching at me and usually on coms telling the teammates hwo were all going to lose over me this was me lowering the team moral i actually have had people go mei and ice wall me out of team fights to prove im doing a terrible job as a healer literally throwing the game while again bitching me out on coms onto your argumentwhat how does the enemy team transcendence matter when the enemy team literally cant be healed by it final point the fact youve seen people perform poorly with her means you feel in the right to bitch people out of playing her i refer back to the first point youre the one degrading the entire teams moral to be the stuck up asshole who knows better
Overwatch,not_removed,i agree she is stronger on attack but ever used anas nade vs trascendence where people try to group and you possible hit people
Overwatch,not_removed,the main reason shes bad at defense is if your opponents have transcendence and sound barrier and all you have is nano boost sound barrier youre going to lose are you forgetting that biotic grenade prevents enemy targets from being healed ana is amazing against zenyatta for that very reason
Overwatch,not_removed,that even though ana is my favourite support now she cant efficiently outheal a lucio unless divine intervention is involved
Overwatch,not_removed,this isnt even close to true ana probably has the best single target heals in the game right now you just get a lot of people that try to play the nonheadshotting sniper as a damage character that occasionally shoots her teammates
Overwatch,not_removed,i want whatever your smoking after the last patch where her rate of fire was increased shes become exceptional as a healer
Overwatch,not_removed,the character is brand new with everyone trying her and only just got a major buff of course shes not going to have comparable stats to literally the best healer in the game virtually everyone is some super hyperbole because those stats are going to be slanted heavily when shes only been out for two weeks and people are still learning her
Overwatch,not_removed,its not even needing to play around ana though its just healers in general mercy zen or lucio cant heal them either its not as though if you were playing a different support you could have saved them youd still need that line of sight in fact anas the only one who maybe could heal them from out of los with her grenade so dont say its that they cant play around ana theyre worse than that they cant play around healing in general
Overwatch,not_removed,its also true that ana works extremely well with another healer people underestimate her but just her sleep and her ability to counter enemy healing make her viable offensively not counting her own dps
Overwatch,not_removed,high skill is the problem not a lot of anas can aim very well
Overwatch,not_removed,i want to marry this comment
Overwatch,not_removed,thats really not a fair comparison mercy has a consistent stream lucio has an aoe and even zeny just has to be in line of sight and heals will aimbot to them every time ana attempts to heal it runs the risk of an enemy running into it and turning it into dps or just missing altogether and being completely useless if consistent dps was king bastion would be amazing and hes not support wins games you can tickle someone with winston all day but if they have zenys orb theyre not dying you can pick at someone with soldier but if mercy is on them theyre not dying thats why you always target the support first mccree is popular because of his burst damage he can damage faster than healers can heal and thats why your comparison is unfair healing dps great supports who can keep the team alive is more important than hypothetical potential healing and burst dps that can out damage healers is more important than tickle damage edit ana also relies a lot on burst healing which is amazing but not great for sustained team fights it doesnt matter if she can hypothetically heal the most if a reaper for example is being focused in a team fight ana literally has to miss one single shot and that reaper is dead in a chaotic team fight you cant reasonably expect accuracy shes an interesting asset and after the nerf im sure shell see a lot of high level play but shes objectively weak as a solo healer even if shes viable shes still the worst option
Overwatch,not_removed,im actually at wins and losses now games unbeaten with ana she just seems better and better the more i play her splashing a grenade at allies and filling them with heals is so bloody satisfying and the ult is such a game changer it charges so rapidly and has such an impact that im worried about a nerf ha i have friends like that but kinda the other way one friend is adamant about how op some heroes are but not ones youd ever hear mentioned on here like pharah for example
Overwatch,not_removed,once again the most important aspect of the game is coordinating with the team if the team wants you to switch switch even if its simply to appease them and get along their request is not unreasonable its one thing if you want to state your case but if they are still insistent after hearing you out you should switch as i outlined before there are problems with giving it a shot you also strike me as the kind of player who wont switch off even after theyve seen its just not working for your second point while it may not be your intention you are effectively trolling them it should come as no surprise that they try to troll you in response this is yet another reason why its so important to coordinate with and in some cases coordinate means appease the team its not the fact that ive seen people perform poorly with her its the fact that on a more difficult hero there is a far greater chance the player cant handle them its also the fact that shes outright bad in a lot of situations and inflexible im going to complain when someone plays ana on defense because even if they play her well she will be a bad pick simply because she is naturally badunsuited at defense that doesnt mean she cant win on defense it means she isnt an optimal pick if your team is significantly better than the opponent you can win with anything but in an even situation a bad pick wont cut it furthermore picks are something we have the most control over so its an easy thing to fix also its players on the team asking the other players to switch so you cant say degrading the entire teams moral im also not trying to be a stuck up asshole who knows better some heroes are simply bad in certain situations either without other heroes against certain heroes at certain places in maps or on certain sides this is a fact of the game and theres no avoiding it i get that you like ana shes a fun hero to play shes unique and interesting spam her as much as you want in qp and pick her when she fits in ranked outside of that you cant expect people to not respond to you negatively as there is no faster way to willingly crater the team into the ground should it be like this maybe not but this is how the game is designed and were stuck with it its not on the onus of the players to overlook design problems its on the developers to fix them if they deem it a problem being successful in ranked is about being coordinated and flexible it is not about instalocking your favorite hero the other players who are serious about the game do not deserve you throwing the match if you want to instalock your favorite hero there is an alternate game mode provided for that quick play also dont assume that the others dont have favorite heroes my favorite hero is pharah who right now is nigh unpickable you dont see me spampicking pharah as i know its going to cause my team to lose and its something that i can easily control and avoid
Overwatch,not_removed,people rarely group up enough during a transcendence for her biotic grenade to actually work ive have yet to see her grenade result in someone dying in a transcendence even if you hit one or two the rest of the team is completely in your face and pushing hard is there a chance on paper that biotic grenade will totally shut down the transcendence yes absolutely but in practice this never happens the only time it could possibly happen is during zarya ult making ana once again extremely dependent on which heroes your team picks transcendence is massive the enemy team wont group up much
Overwatch,not_removed,everyone likes to say this but its not true biotic grenade has a very small radius at most youre going to hit heroes and its not going to do a damn thing it has mild use in a zarya ult but useless outside of that and they still have sound barrier
Overwatch,not_removed,if you can hit every single shot yeah she has the highest hps unfortunately no one is capable of doing that in general let alone against heroes that zone block and kill you her strong point is her utility not her heals
Overwatch,not_removed,the single target healz guys trolololol soundbarrier and transcendence are just times better at turning the tide in a teamfight genji ulti and ana is dead in seconds but ignoring all the blantant problems yes she can single target heal so gud just like bastion can single target damage so gud
Overwatch,not_removed,thats what i said
Overwatch,not_removed,all healers work well with another healer
Overwatch,not_removed,not a problem with ana
Overwatch,not_removed,my aim isnt the best but i still have almost no problems at all healing with ana
Overwatch,not_removed,you can miss when applying zens heal sometimes i want to heal the genji who is hopping about on the point but our stupid junkrat lands to the left of me just slightly in front of me and he gets the orb instead even if i had clear line of sight to the genji
Overwatch,not_removed,so what if you dont connect a couple of shots even with a few misses ana still heals more than mercy or zen i call that more reliable in the healing department yes the other healers cant possibly miss but they also cant possibly top her output even with those misses
Overwatch,not_removed,if i have accuracy every attempted hit on an ally was a hit and i missed a few shots aimed towards enemies you understand that she shoots at enemies sometimes too right of her shots fired are not intentionally pointed towards her allies
Overwatch,not_removed,biotic grenade has a very small radius at most youre going to hit heroes and its not going to do a damn thing a few days ago i hit four enemies with a poorly timed biotic grenade killed one and weakened the rest and then immediately stunned another the other day and got potg seemed to do a damn thing for me
Overwatch,not_removed,if you can hit more than half your shots yeah she has the highest hps fixed that for you its actually even less than that when factoring in her grenade but we
Overwatch,not_removed,right because zenyatta is going to survive those genji ults wait no he isnt
Overwatch,not_removed,most players dont see it that way though its always the onehealer and done routine
Overwatch,not_removed,i know it sounds great in theory you are probably right but when im as mercy with ana in my team gold for healing every single time and im not even average mercy player according to my stats do ana players consistently suck in my matches then too busy dishing just a bit of damage for the red i dont know but that was my experience since ana came onboard dont misunderstand though i dont dislike ana or anything its just what i see onscreen
Overwatch,not_removed,confirmation bias it worked once so it must be good every time its rarely going to do anything its actually going to do nothing if the enemy team has a dva which is one of the most popular attack heroes in comp queue atm or a rein or a shield of any kind transcendence is massive they dont need to group up on the offchance they dont have a tank they get zarya ulted and you land the biotic without it getting blocked by something then its good this is rarely going to happen transcendencesound barrier is going to crap all over your team and youll have no response its all about consistencyhow frequently something is going to make a difference
Overwatch,not_removed,guaranteed healing per second versus healing a shot where it depends on both the shooters precision and the enemy not body blockingzoningshielding the shot and relies on the interp not being complete garbage really hard decision
Overwatch,not_removed,transcendence ever heard of it
Overwatch,not_removed,given she literally just came out id argue that really skews the average down since the vast majority of stats will be from people who just tried her out and have no experience with her kit
Overwatch,not_removed,those heal stats are garbage low like less than a third my avgs i have no issues landing heals as ana and i find her to deffinately be my fave supp however lucio has utility in his kit that causes me to frequently question if i should be her over him the issue is that while she with out a doubt is the best healer isnt the best support her utility gives her a single target peelanti tank that can be countered by her team her big upside is her healing output and ult mercy and lucio are able to be slightly better as a supportive role with speed boosts and damage amps that dont have a cd is ana my fave supp with highest avg healing yes is she the best support hands down because of her healing no there are no supports that are objectively better symmetra is an amazing support due to her peel and anti flanker layout shields are lacking but a nice bonus ana is best in a comp that has pack synergy so her grenade hits as many as often as possible while her sniper heals flankers that are off doing their own thing a comp that works wonders is rein ana reaper zarya and mcreesecond supp since a lot of those characters synergize well as a group and even if they split ana has the range to keep them alive and they have some strong survivability on their own the biggest pro to ana over other supports is her long uptime due to being able to deal with threats better than other supports tranq keeps her in the fight longer as well as her damage and burst self heal there are so many pros and cons to weigh that to rule her out completely is foolish
Overwatch,not_removed,shes new people are still learning that shes not widowmaker give it some time and those statistics will change whenever i play her and theres another healer ill outheal them usually while your average ana isnt going to be good enough compared to the others she definitely the potential to shine and i think a lot of people are ignoring that
Overwatch,not_removed,you cant look at the stats like that there is a portion of ana players that barely heal so it skews the statistics
Overwatch,not_removed,and mercy is going to be healing the wrong team member at the wrong time and zenyatta wont be able to react fast enough to throw his orb on his friend fast enough to save them whats your point other healers are about good positioning and game sense and this healer is about hitting shots how is that any different
Overwatch,not_removed,guaranteed damage per second winston versus or less damage a shot mccree where it depends on both the shooters precision and abother enemy not body blockingzoningshielding the shot and relies on the interp not being complete garbage really hard decision
Overwatch,not_removed,oh right you can use your ultimate to save yourself that ult that is so good at turning the tide in a team fight wow great use of it meanwhile ill just put him to sleep without wasting my ultimate on him wow
Overwatch,not_removed,and while people getting used to it they suck because theyre not there yet i mean she has to have aim to heal right at the moment of writing masteroverwatch reports weapon accuracy for her in competitive ofc these stats should be taken with a grain of salt but man let it sink in for a bit op may be one of those good ana players but the reality is majority seem to be farcry from that for whatever reason
Overwatch,not_removed,and those are the people who make expectations of victory drop whenever i see an ana
Overwatch,not_removed,haha you are genuinely a fucking idiot for believing that winston has comparable damage to mccree and thinking that the comparison between a tank and a damage character translates to a comparison between two healers
Overwatch,not_removed,oh right you can use your ultimate to negate the whole genji ulti fyp just lol whats your competitive rank if you seriously think you can reliably sleep any genji worth his money over rank you are honestly just retarded there are whole threads about people asking how to track genji as hitscancharacter when he doublejumps but sure you are the god of ana who can hit genji of the time give me a fuckin break like against what kind of retarded genjis did you play before if genji ultis the teamfight is on of the time you are talking about saving yourself with the ulti wtf you are saving your teamdenying his ulti and any zenyatta worth his money has at least the same energy build up as a genji your posts are just so mega retarded one doesnt even know how to begin to wrap around their head around so much bullshit
Overwatch,not_removed,theres something about anas weapon accuracy i average gametogame around un scoped accuracy usually from spam healing or getting caught fighting fairly decent genjis or tracers in my back line and scoped accuracy you can even see those averages in the results screen however if i look at her weapon accuracy it shows me as having like on the official blizzard profiles and i know thats not true by even the most remote sense i do whiff her sleep dart too often but not that often and i know her grenades connect most of the time id point out here that master overwatch is really screwy and i wish people wouldnt rely on it as a measuring stick my stats dont even register most of the time but this is a problem on the official profiles too so i wouldnt use that average as a measuring stick by which to judge anas overall something is really off on how her accuracy is being calculated outside the game
Overwatch,not_removed,how does anyone miss that much lowest acc ive had with her is unscope scope and i was having a bad day
Overwatch,not_removed,its a comparison between characters with accurate hitscan weapons vs shorterrange tethers a good winston is going to do more damage than a bad mccree while a good mccree hits his targets winston has many of the advantages over mccree that mercy touts over ana mobility and a perfectlyaccurate weapon and yet mccree can solidly outdamage him once you understand how somebody who can aim takes a character with no mobility and turns them into a high damage dealer its equally possible to understand how somebody with that same aim is going to do a lot of healing not that i expect you to give in at this point youve already called me genuinely a fucking idiot too late for you to turn back now
Overwatch,not_removed,its a hell of a lot more reliable than using an ultimate an ulting genji becomes meleeonly its not at all unreasonable to be able to hit him with a sleep dart
Overwatch,not_removed,yeah i guess given some time the omfg ana healer we are so fucked mentality will subside as more players get used to playing her
Overwatch,not_removed,it doesnt count shots that hit full hp targets those are counted as a miss noticed that kinda early
Overwatch,not_removed,maybe her hits on ally dont account or account for misses because no damage just a wild guess i have no basis not tested or anything
Overwatch,not_removed,if you fundamentally dont understand why having an inconsistent healer instead of luciozenyatta or even mercy is an incorrect decision this is the point where i stop responding for my own mental health
Overwatch,not_removed,its a hell of a lot more reliable than using an ultimate hahahahahahahaha you should tell all the pro teams hopefully they will catch on to all your protactics
Overwatch,not_removed,its already mostly gone in the pc rating but people there also actually go for the double healer meta so maybe thats why
Overwatch,not_removed,yeah im not sure what it is but theres something messed up the blizzard profile will tell me she has the worst accuracy of any character in my roster by a wide margin but my results screen at the end of every match says something else entirely
Overwatch,not_removed,counts as a miss on full hp allies
Overwatch,not_removed,its probably best you do youve sounded extremely upset this entire time go take a nap
Overwatch,not_removed,my guess is that the accuracy system wasnt adjusted to account for healing and is still about shots fired vs shots hit on enemy hitting an ally doesnt give you a hit marker so theyre definitely considered differently by the system
Overwatch,not_removed,counts as a miss on allies
Overwatch,not_removed,that does make sense especially in line with other errors in the past it does definitely show that one cant go by any trackers to determine anas average accuracy at any rate until or unless thats somehow fixed because the game itself can obviously detect it in the results screen but not on the career profile
Overwatch,not_removed,long ass link you could do that instead of filling my entire screen with blue text
Overwatch,not_removed,your submission has been removed the reasons being resubmit without referral if you have any questions please state them in an answer to this post for concerns or to contact the whole staff please with the removal of my submissionmessageim writing to you about the following submission issue is for more information please consult httpswwwredditcomroverwatchwikirules
Overwatch,not_removed,how the hell are they going to give us a salt spray and a bunch of soulcrushing gg is this easy mode winky face voice lines and not allow us to teabag for the ultimate bm machine
Overwatch,not_removed,dva cant crouch but can bow and sit
Overwatch,not_removed,cause crouching makes you silent and the meka cant be silent cause its a fucking meka but blizzard cant be bothered to differentiate
Overwatch,not_removed,can you crouch with your car while sitting in it can you crouch while jumping thread
Overwatch,not_removed,because crouching and looking straight down would completely hide her giant crit hitbox as it is in front of her rather than over the shoulders
Overwatch,not_removed,and while were at it why can zenyatta get stuck in junkrats trap edit s
Overwatch,not_removed,how will i tell players in skirmish that im a friendly dva
Overwatch,not_removed,knees weak meka heavy cant crouch tank spaghetti
Overwatch,not_removed,literally unplayable
Overwatch,not_removed,zenyatta just hovers down and doesnt crouch and also dva has one of the biggest head hitboxes in the game if someone spams crouch it could make most shots miss
Overwatch,not_removed,bro he is hovering he just lowers his flux capacitor power a few jigawatts
Overwatch,not_removed,i think it also has something to do with the fact that crouch walking is less noisy and dva walking is really noisy
Overwatch,not_removed,b
Overwatch,not_removed,she wouldnt stop teabagging
Overwatch,not_removed,at first i had the reflex to click on r to reload when playing dva still do sometimes now i have the reflex to click crtlcrtlcrtl ehm sometimes
Overwatch,not_removed,it is a foot robot crouch for what purpose blizzard we need laser eyes and missile turrets on the dva mech pronto for the love of what is holy is and titanfall has these things since titanfall
Overwatch,not_removed,i mean sure zenyatta might be better at crouching but the mech is way better at exploding
Overwatch,not_removed,also zen has achieved true enlightenment dva is still working on it
Overwatch,not_removed,precisely
Overwatch,not_removed,to balance the bmeta
Overwatch,not_removed,hold onto ult kill target you want to teabag deliberately press q to exit suit teabag spray emote voice line turn sensitivity spaz hope roadhog hooks suit into team for accidental profit
Overwatch,not_removed,holy shit crouch will muffle footstep sounds
Overwatch,not_removed,simple fix dont make couching make the meka silent
Overwatch,not_removed,yet bastion and rein still get their footsteps muffled maybe not as much as other heroes i dunno
Overwatch,not_removed,have you seen her mech bow or do the bunny hop emote
Overwatch,not_removed,for the first one that shouldnt matter because its the mech that would have to crouch not dva herself
Overwatch,not_removed,if the mech can sit the mech can crouch
Overwatch,not_removed,thing is my car doesnt have legs
Overwatch,not_removed,
Overwatch,not_removed,yeah but then youre crouched staring at the ground in the middle of a fight like a dumbass
Overwatch,not_removed,with the nerf it doesnt make a difference though
Overwatch,not_removed,this the reason given for why this would be bad is that it would supposedly make her able to stall the objective for an unreasonable amount of time
Overwatch,not_removed,its actually on a chain like a mini chain chomp
Overwatch,not_removed,httpsgfycatcomexaltedillinformedirishterrier
Overwatch,not_removed,i was almost going to make a post out of this but then searched since this must have come up before
Overwatch,not_removed,because it jumps up to catch people if youve ever tried to jump over it youve seen this
Overwatch,not_removed,the same way a sentient monk robot can flyits a game
Overwatch,not_removed,hi annyeong hiya winky face
Overwatch,not_removed,crouch spam has been nerfed and the critical hitbox is huge even with the old crouch it would be hard to miss
Overwatch,not_removed,yeah but zennyata acting as a flanker who does that except the ones in qp and even crouching dva is hard not to spot after a while
Overwatch,not_removed,couldnt they just have her crouch be noisey though like some hydraulic sounds going off and shit
Overwatch,not_removed,we want to teabag in meka
Overwatch,not_removed,to line up my hoop shots
Overwatch,not_removed,emp
Overwatch,not_removed,but wouldnt being lighter make zen float higher
Overwatch,not_removed,hes only year older than dva shell get there soon
Overwatch,not_removed,yep
Overwatch,not_removed,basics to fps crouching muffles footsteps in like every game
Overwatch,not_removed,not silent but for most characters it may as well be
Overwatch,not_removed,great for i do it all the time
Overwatch,not_removed,yes crouching does muffle footsteps but you will hear the sound more frequently about twice as fast so in a with nobody else around standing still and moving in intervals is more effective but usually it should make yourself harder to notice
Overwatch,not_removed,that works but it would be a little unintuitive the best way to communicate to the player that the meka cant be quiet is to not let the meka do the thing that all the other characters do to make themselves quiet
Overwatch,not_removed,well of course blizzard is lazy sometimes though that was the joke
Overwatch,not_removed,well can your car crouch
Overwatch,not_removed,thread
Overwatch,not_removed,wtf pic or didnt happen i wanna see how you let your car crouch
Overwatch,not_removed,aha now theyll never destroy me and all i have to do is sit here and wait for them to come and destroy me
Overwatch,not_removed,cant do shit while looking at the ground no matrix no shooting no flying youre a sitting duck
Overwatch,not_removed,no it wouldnt she would just die like an idiot staring at the ground
Overwatch,not_removed,i mean i get the reasoning but if thats the problem just face the wallcornerpayload and you get the same results while being more mobile
Overwatch,not_removed,yup stalling is meis job not dvas
Overwatch,not_removed,heppy halloween its february
Overwatch,not_removed,missing a dva its like asking for the team to ask you to switch
Overwatch,not_removed,that works but it would be a little unintuitive the best way to communicate to the player that the meka cant be quiet is to not let the meka do the thing that all the other characters do to make themselves quiet
Overwatch,not_removed,you win
Overwatch,not_removed,he floats higher normally when he wants to crouch he just turns off his enlightenment
Overwatch,not_removed,how the fuck am i supposed to teabag my enemies though
Overwatch,not_removed,my car doesnt have legs
Overwatch,not_removed,buses can for disabled or push chairs soo
Overwatch,not_removed,kneeling buses are a thing you know
Overwatch,not_removed,dvas mech has legs so it can definately crouch yeah its a transformer whats your point
Overwatch,not_removed,yours cant s
Overwatch,not_removed,til car battle mech p
Overwatch,not_removed,no but a car doesnt have legs or guns or rocket boosters on it come to think of it its almost like a car and a mecha are completely separate things entirely
Overwatch,not_removed,buses do that hydraulic stuff at the bottom so they can lower themselves on bus stops you can install that in your car too but it would be pretty useless
Overwatch,not_removed,oh yeah i agree i dont think it would actually help her at all thats just the reason ive seen people give for why she cant crouch
Overwatch,not_removed,stalling is totally dvas job she gets to point quickly straight up negates damage for seconds maybe gets a chance to fly around the point a bit and then has health to get through in fact before her buff that used to be the only way pros played her
Overwatch,not_removed,dva has to be inspired by asuka the first thing that popped up in my head when i played her for the first time was asuka
Overwatch,not_removed,true though i dont think dva being able to block off her critbox would allow her to stall for much longer than normal especially with the current state of her mech
Overwatch,not_removed,but roadhog makes noise whilst hes crouched the jinglejangle gives him away
Overwatch,not_removed,the game
Overwatch,not_removed,a low riders default height is crouching though it cant change its height at will
Overwatch,not_removed,for people who are disabled you always put the person before the disability
Overwatch,not_removed,still waiting for that eva unit skin
Overwatch,not_removed,he may have won it but i lost it thanks a lot
Overwatch,not_removed,no
Overwatch,not_removed,literally copied my previous post from your post history to see if you would notice were you on to me
Overwatch,not_removed,reminds me of this one of my faves
Overwatch,not_removed,until i read this comment i didnt realize thanks a lot bud
Overwatch,not_removed,well youre just ignorant
Overwatch,not_removed,it seemed familiar but why would you go back so deep into my post history d
Overwatch,not_removed,or its just a pointless semantic that most people dont care about
Overwatch,not_removed,initially i went back just to see how long you had played the game and whether you were around when dva stall was a thing in ranked before hero limits but also before she was good when i saw your evangelion x dva comment i thought it would be funny to see if you recognized it not stalking just curious ◔◔
Overwatch,not_removed,or its disability etiquette which a lot of people care about maybe youre just a scum bag who doesnt understand how hurtful you can really be to someone dont take your everyday actions for granted
Overwatch,not_removed,i play since open beta but never heard about dvas in ranked being a legitimate strat
Overwatch,not_removed,i dont understand how hurtful i can be as you proceed to call me a scum bag in the same sentence really making your case there man
Overwatch,not_removed,it was only used for stalls on the last point to draw down the time bank or potentially stabilize nowadays this is done with some combination of dva mei lucio tracer winston ana minus anyone who already has an ult that can be used to stall
Overwatch,not_removed,i think switching to tracer was way more prevalent
Overwatch,not_removed,huge difference youre choosing to be the way you are and im calling you out on it someone with a disability didnt choose to be that way you can change while they dont have that opportunity all you have to do is change your outlook on the matter while a person with a disability has to live with constant ridicule because of the struggles they have to go through on a daily bases just saying its as simple as choosing your words a little more wisely but you dont think thats necessary which proves my point of you being a scum bag its not hard you just dont want to do it because you dont think you have too good luck in life
Overwatch,not_removed,can anyone give a proper reason for that reinhardt ultimate going through our reinhardts shield
Overwatch,not_removed,didnt he just let the shield down for a split second
Overwatch,not_removed,no watch it in slow motion and you can see it was up the entire time but then we all fall and it goes down
Overwatch,not_removed,actually i think this happened to us today too my boyfriend said the same thing as i did but i swear i saw the enemy reins shield up during our rein ult o
Overwatch,not_removed,sr and region
Overwatch,not_removed,whats your psn
Overwatch,not_removed,jef van den brande europe
Overwatch,not_removed,
Overwatch,not_removed,usa
Overwatch,not_removed,i have experienced healers getting less than they used to but maybe thats because everyone backed off the rhetoric of you have to vote for the healer no exceptions
Overwatch,not_removed,personally i upvote whomever i noticed doing the most work if the healer is on their game and keeping everyone in the fight upvote however if the mercy is permanently locked onto the uninjured rein the whole match no upvote
Overwatch,not_removed,thats what they have in paladins seems to work fine
Overwatch,not_removed,this is essentially that one mode and only iirc from paladins
Overwatch,not_removed,i group up with my friends we win many games and i end up placed in rank my friends leave and i have a solo game i rank up to i have a few loses and fall in rank at this point it feels like no matter what my team does we still lose and winning gives very little exp compared to losing then i have a game where people leave i get beat on because people left i go down even lower just today i went from rank to i dont even have much control in winning or not even if i heal the shit out of people if they dont get things done we lose one game i had fucking health healed and mins on objective time but we still lost because people are not doing well i dont even know what to do anymore i think i learned my lesson never play without your group which means i cant play anyomore because they are all on vaction i just needed to vent i had a bad day and got yelled at by a hanzo main because i wasnt keeping him at health at all times while i get wailed on by tracer the responce i get is just ignore her easy for you to say you fucking hanzo main you never see her because she is too busy killing me
Overwatch,not_removed,you
Overwatch,not_removed,i got full man games only nearly only against full man sometimes mans it s worse to rank up i play a pretty good offensive carry and won every game straight from to even with the bug from koth but against full teams we struggled to get the same level of teamplay so i feel like i got placed wrong but so far i did good to get to my tier my experience so far is pretty good a few people insisting on their random hanzo or junkrat picks but all in all people picked what i told them to play so yeah competitive is more enjoyable id say you need to have the skill to actually carry with the role you play yes even as supp you carry with good mercy ults and positioning you need to know how to build a good teamcomp always atleast tank most time reinhardt mercy and lucio you have to be able to counter pharah is stomping you so play soldier mccree roadhog and dominate her
Overwatch,not_removed,solo queue lvl currently i mostly play support i got rank the first reaction was feeling like a shit player because i didnt get at least but i also understand that as a healer i cant win the game on my own first game out of placement i really liked how it built teams with an equal avg rank we absolutely crushed them and i moved to kind of pleased with it so far still getting a feel for it obviously but getting to or will be really rewarding and so on the placement rounds suck the teams are way out of balance and there are a lot of blowouts that you could end up on the wrong side of also took a loss during placement because a player left which is dumb main difference from quick play is that the games are about as long
Overwatch,not_removed,i got rank but had a lot of disconnects during the placements also had because of dc so my potential is above
Overwatch,not_removed,solo que expected got
Overwatch,not_removed,yeah playing solo doesnt work out from to they already said it will take a couple of seasons until they find the right system this clearly isnt the one

Overwatch,not_removed,the first thing i do as reinhardt when i get nano boosted is charge off the map too it was unfortunate that people got in your way
Overwatch,not_removed,default rein with golden hammer feels oddlyright
Overwatch,not_removed,it was woorthhhittttt
Overwatch,not_removed,haarrrrooooo
Overwatch,not_removed,you stay i go no follow
Overwatch,not_removed,highlight intro checks out
Overwatch,not_removed,is this what happen during water gate
Overwatch,not_removed,freight train incoming
Overwatch,not_removed,holy shit
Overwatch,not_removed,you mean meticulously planned right
Overwatch,not_removed,had that not worked the way it did ana would be in her right to be pissed at such a wasted ult p
Overwatch,not_removed,default skin and golden hammer now thats some fucking style
Overwatch,not_removed,gold hammer but default skin somethings not adding up
Overwatch,not_removed,great work nixon we love you
Overwatch,not_removed,am i the only one who appreciates the fact that he was smart enough to bait and block the enemy reinhardts ult first
Overwatch,not_removed,in a game like overwatch you dont need to try or do anything it win the game practically plays itself
Overwatch,not_removed,well i just lost the game thanks
Overwatch,not_removed,get in there and wwwwwwwwreck up the place
Overwatch,not_removed,oh man i just hate when my cat jumps on my keyboard and hits shift and theres nothing i can do to prevent it and i win the game
Overwatch,not_removed,where was the accident
Overwatch,not_removed,righteous charge
Overwatch,not_removed,wait those railings are destructible thats awesome
Overwatch,not_removed,highly appropriate highlight introduction
Overwatch,not_removed,recording a twitch highlight that is a ingame highlight in the highlight tab with a cursor on the screen yes
Overwatch,not_removed,i salute you in name effort and your fine precision german engineering
Overwatch,not_removed,honestly if you seriously didnt know those players were back there you had no reason to kill yourself for just one guy what the hell were you thinking
Overwatch,not_removed,i rock the golden hammer with a common brass skin it looks great
Overwatch,not_removed,oops
Overwatch,not_removed,i hate people like you full hp and nanoboosted and still putting up the shield
Overwatch,not_removed,i hate to be that guy buy he could have fucked up he was nannobusted so he could have just nail the fuck out of them instead of that risky play
Overwatch,not_removed,nixons baaaaaaaaack
Overwatch,not_removed,rrrrrrriiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiidddddddddded wiiiiiith lobitis
Overwatch,not_removed,arrooooo
Overwatch,not_removed,more like headless clone agnew
Overwatch,not_removed,i too was aroused
Overwatch,not_removed,you can even see me swerve to avoid them poor fellas
Overwatch,not_removed,the legendary skins are so common now i love zee classics
Overwatch,not_removed,looks like hes acquired his weapon of the chosen one™
Overwatch,not_removed,yep for player is a fantastic exchange environment kills cant be rezzed either
Overwatch,not_removed,arrooooooooo
Overwatch,not_removed,damn psycho pete is so lame now
Overwatch,not_removed,it vas vorth iiiiiiit ftfy
Overwatch,not_removed,some railings arent but most of them are sometimes i punch them out to make it easier to jump over stairs or plant a torb turret second to last checkpoint on dorado comes to mind
Overwatch,not_removed,looked like he was aiming for the railings but didnt know that reins charge wasnt stopped by them
Overwatch,not_removed,enemy rein also likely had earthshatter you can see me put up the shield shortly after running in without it in an attempt to bait it out once i knew he didnt have it i switched focus to the rest of his team sometimes you have to put the shield up for the team even if it isnt best for you
Overwatch,not_removed,pretty sure that play wasnt deliberate lol
Overwatch,not_removed,arooooooooooo edit i actually found the i commented this
Overwatch,not_removed,phlebitis
Overwatch,not_removed,riddled
Overwatch,not_removed,damn you now i have to find a new oddlyright combination
Overwatch,not_removed,i think the legendaries are awesome but im way too in love with the paragon skin to ever switch
Overwatch,not_removed,it has helmet therefore its gross
Overwatch,not_removed,especially as offense
Overwatch,not_removed,and then suicide off the cliff with nanoboost risking to lose the game
Overwatch,not_removed,time for dicky to get tricky
Overwatch,not_removed,skin gold weapon oddly right©®™
Overwatch,not_removed,in this case its worth it but in most cases when i see a rein do this my blood boils the best you can reliably hope for is one maybe kills as soon as you do your team losses its shield and a huge chunk of survivability and staying power suddenly all of your squishies feel like a peeled prawn with nothing to hide behind on a map like volskaya or anubis the enemy doesnt necessarily need to kill the remaining players on your team they basically rez on top of the point so they just have to keep contesting any of your team that die have a much longer way to walk than they do tldr throwing yourself off a cliff at the beginning of a fight is usually the wrong thing to do dont take the cowards way out die fighting
Overwatch,not_removed,that said if my shield is about to break anyway i consider a suicide charge to potentially be worth it especially if it means everyones turning to kill the armored giant whos just charged onto the point while my teams still shooting
Overwatch,not_removed,charging in is fine that provides a target and a distraction charging straight off the map is almost always a bad move situational exceptions notwithstanding
Overwatch,not_removed,yeah if that widow wouldve picked off that rein if mightve been the end of the game lucios ult can only go so far
Overwatch,not_removed,mercy can fly out dva can fly out reind can charge out genji can swift strike out reaper can wraith out tracer can blinkrecall out widowmaker can grapple hook out mcree cant roll out winston cant jump out phara cant fly out i think thats everyone lol edit and to answer your mcree question when in graviton surge everyone is floating so mcree rolling is a nono
Overwatch,not_removed,no he cant im pretty sure that mcree will just be pulled back in to the ult
Overwatch,not_removed,but he is a bamf cant he just magically roll in the air hehe jk
Overwatch,not_removed,ok good to know thanks
Overwatch,not_removed,are you sure your credit card information was correct if you are i would talk to your card provider
Overwatch,not_removed,yes im really sure i checked it like times and its correct
Overwatch,not_removed,like i said talk to your card provider
Overwatch,not_removed,i tried buying at steam and it worked but in battlenet its not working
Overwatch,not_removed,vicariously i experience tranquility
Overwatch,not_removed,when hes on the same team as ana he says something like just like the old days to which she replies something like except for the part where you become homicidal that suggests he has some memory of what the old days were like
Overwatch,not_removed,i dont think we have enough information to answer that he seems to answer when people ask what happened to him even if its just by asking his own question if he still associates himself as gabriel thats not clear he doesnt say anything about his time in blackwatch and he doesnt say anything about himself at most we have seen him say how hell end overwatchs sad tale how mccree is an ingrate and that he taught him everything he knows i think maybe reyes is there there on some level but hes more reaper then reyes which is disappointing because we know nothing of who reyes was as a person its sad that reyes doesnt even have a line for hollywood considering the guy was born and raised in la
Overwatch,not_removed,man i hope they expand on reyesreaper soon

Overwatch,not_removed,i wanted one too too bad is just for female c hit me if you find it for male too
Overwatch,not_removed,unfortunately im really picky and its not exactly what im looking for but thanks for your responding really appreciate the feedback and the links
Overwatch,not_removed,people in hell want ice water and witch mercys so gg i want a junkensteins monster
Overwatch,not_removed,the most important question do you actually play mercy or do you just want something pretty to look at
Overwatch,not_removed,blizzard coins
Overwatch,not_removed,lootboxes later and still no witch mercy and my friends arent going to be playing at all until the events over so my choices are solo queue or give in gdi blizzard and speaking of solo queue i know you think youre funny mei but please stop walling off your allied symmetra so that her turrets are delayed it actually is significantly harmful to a character thats already hugely situational
Overwatch,not_removed,die together you cunts i have
Overwatch,not_removed,why the fuck is mei a thing bluzzard you fucking tools shit faces i totally get you want a bluzzard chick fucking vlizzard nane but yiubfucking tawts really oylked iff tge shittiest shit if the shit witg nei
Overwatch,not_removed,people who play characters for the first time in competitive modefuck you
Overwatch,not_removed,if i hear one more fucking junkrat main refuse to switch to something to better help the team because i have gold damage or i have silvergoldfucking whatever elims i will flip i swear junkrat is what hanzo mains decide to play once they realize hanzo isnt super viable since they can then get gold damage and an elimination medal by charging the enemy zaryas shields and feeding the enemy supports ults and they always get so fucking offended when you ask them to switch team hey junkrat good job last round but theyve changed their comp where junkrat isnt a good choice would you mind switching or letting someone else go hitscan for that pharah for example junkrat goes on all chat noob team wants me to switch even though i have gold damage lmao noobs me
Overwatch,not_removed,my team cant experience tranquillity because of a stupid grenade im gonna discord and launch my balls at you ana
Overwatch,not_removed,listen here you reaper main im a zenyatta a squishy support so when the enemy winston keeps dropping in to hunt me down like i owe him rent it is your job to persuade him to fck off i know your one of the best damage dealers but when i see a fucking winston land right next to you and see you proceed to ignore him to death blossom your way to a mediocre potg you got me tiltled i cant run away fast enough and i dont have enought luck to be able to kill him so please if you see the enemy has a winston be aware of where he is
Overwatch,not_removed,grinded levels to prestige probably only have hours till event ends commence the epic gringing of levels in a day rip my time
Overwatch,not_removed,can we get a game mode that combines the lowstakes relatively relaxed mood of quick play with the inability to have the enemy team be six meis
Overwatch,not_removed,quick match and single que rank teams that completely ignore the composion of the team and the teamwork aspect of the game
Overwatch,not_removed,do not autolock a character and then proceed to tell everyone else who they should play unless you are some top player who harry pottered their way into silver especially when you chose dva and are already screaming need healing after of the first push you literally have a built in shield oh and when youve overextended and the enemy dva is now ass assaulting me while on the point dont scream at me because i wont fly on my beautiful witch mercy broom to the balcony outside the first spawn on kings row my first priority is this mcree actually trying to defend this mysterious thing known as the objective
Overwatch,not_removed,if you havent had the unfortunate luck to play at gold rank sr then quit giving fucking advice on this sub on how to get out of it goddammit you high ranked pieces of shit all season you have been telling us gold rank children how we are where we belong when most of you have never been here do you also tell homeless people how to buy a house in your spare time
Overwatch,not_removed,still havent gotten a legendary item out of a loot box since last weeks one ffs considering that i get everyday since then
Overwatch,not_removed,my level is too damn high to learn new heroes anymore i wanted to try someone in quickplay but our team was getting rolled by a fucking duo queue made of a star and a fucking silver icon thing i didnt even know the rank thing went silver
Overwatch,not_removed,being teamed up in competitive with pretty sucky players is pretty suckyalso hate it when all the healers on a team are in a groupbundle up togethersont heal the rest and get killed
Overwatch,not_removed,its about the end of the halloween event and i havent got that mercy witch skin yet just the fuking grey grey blue grey shit
Overwatch,not_removed,who the fuck took my username tracer is mine dammit
Overwatch,not_removed,hanzo triggers me so much its like i cant walk around a corner without being footshotted by a dam scatter arrow or taking a log to the face at least mccree gives people the chance to retaliate this is why hanzo will never reclaim his honor ugh
Overwatch,not_removed,oh hey how about that i still found the unpinned thread so i am playing a competitive game of overwatch as you do win the first match and figure hey ive enough time for a second one why not partake in overwatch some more it turns out to have been a mistake so first someone picks dva immediately the meta police arrives and officer genji whips out his badge weeoweeo hey switch off dva but fortunately im with some sort of gold paragons who claim that dvas fine you dont have to switch i merely chime in with you might find it harder if they have a zarya so if they have one id suggest switching since we dont know what they have well thats it it was attack hanamura but seriously dudes this is gold who cares about your pick so long as you arent getting hard countered i pick zenyatta because of course dvas our only tank but i figure eh theyre not going to hold the choke well we can probably do this they didnt hold the choke well we were just worse at going through naturally mister instalock genji begins to bitch about the team i figure eh nobodys staying alive enough for zens harmony and were not killing fast enough even with discord so fuck it im going soldier at least he has healing just in case so we do and by the grace of them fucking up we overtake point a i want to say i had a sick rocket direct hit and some pew pews but lets not overstate my importance too much i figure our only chance is to rush b because even if their choke was shit b is much harder to force and doubly so when the team is already infighting and also couldnt punch through a shit choke dva has the same idea so off we go we make a valiant effort but theyd already fallen back and we are eventually blocked at b naturally genji complains about team dva counterbitches at genji the total age in that conversation did not exceed as both voices seemed quite young and both called each other year old genji switches to symmetra collective groan is heard as we all know hes going for troll id already reported him for harassment because lets be real fuck that guy i pick mei because i am a horrible person also we needed a dps and i figure mei can stop people in their tracks also i know how to use the wall as a bridge so if anyone communicated for a boost id be happy to oblige we held a surprisingly long symmetra got her teleporter and i because i have faith in my fellow human being took it i am also not stupid so i just stood still i hear symmetroll laughing over comms except there is no death since as i mentioned before i am not stupid i just chime in with dude i didnt die thats an overplayed troll rest of the team gangs up on him he tries to claim we mad while im just heading towards a we lose a and i die because im trying to contest what is essentially a lost point not my brightest moment but goddammit the objective is love the objective is life we end up drawing i decide to cut off overwatch for the night because im not chancing a third game so in short a symmetroll could have won us the game in defense but decided to troll because of team comp on attack and thus we somehow drew it because were in gold and thus bad didnt lose sr over it but seriously folks maybe if yall gave a shit about the game instead of the meta yalld win more
Overwatch,not_removed,what do you mean i lost this for you i got golds as ana while youre bastion
Overwatch,not_removed,i freaking hate meis ult
Overwatch,not_removed,reinhardt dont charge into the opposite team halfway across the map youre dead reinhardt you fool
Overwatch,not_removed,still real tired of being stun locked every game like for fucks sake blizzard why are all of your games plagued with the shit that is stunlock how is it fun to play a game when you dont get to play it getting real sick of instant lock picks in competitive stop fucking maining you piece of shit the entire game revolves around switching this isnt the pros i dont give a fuck if you have playtime with genji pick someone else you twat its a fucking team game if you dont want to work with a team then play a fucking single player game this means being willing to switch roles and characters not fucking picking hanzo every match because you are too juvenile to learn any other heroes
Overwatch,not_removed,ive grinded away loot boxes since the start of the event but fucking cant get witch mercy fuck you blizzard for giving me roadhog skins the only character i dont play i call conspiracy
Overwatch,not_removed,why must i be forever stuck in a rubber band of competetive queue going up and down in sr
Overwatch,not_removed,i had to get duplicate legendaries in one loot box and i didnt even have enough for another legendary fuck you blizzard
Overwatch,not_removed,why does every player think they are good and everyone else is bad i think overwatch players are a bit like drivers behind the wheel
Overwatch,not_removed,i just came here to say holy fuck south korea is good holy fuck shadowburn is good nerf shadowburn pls
Overwatch,not_removed,are you an overwatch dick take my short survey and find out if you answer yes to any of these questions you might be a dick do you get salty at your comp team for losing do you get salty at your qp team for any reason at all do you icewall your teammates in spawn do you emote after every fucking thing you do ingame just in case you accidentally do something cool that you can post to reddit do you respond to ive noticed that does this with oh you must not have played against any good players hanzo faq q surely its okay to get salty if a no overwatch problems arent real problems being a dick is a real problem q i killed ppl i want to emote a get back in your goddamn mech dva
Overwatch,not_removed,i had to go through comp games of teams not knowing how to group up and work together just to level up once something that would have taken one game if i had won
Overwatch,not_removed,fuck favour the shooter its the single reason all of this shitty hitboxes thing exists every other fucking fps i have ever played has never had issues with bad internet and shooting but overwatch goes all special snowflake and decides to use this fucking bullshit system too many times have i died to a bullshit hook or arrow its time to fucking stop blizz
Overwatch,not_removed,to the fucker who picks last and is always a dps knowing we need a healer fuck you all hou have to do is play lucio just speed me out of spawn and switch to heal stand by me and when we go for a team push just ult
Overwatch,not_removed,i just want the god damn junkenstain skin i dont even want to play overwatch anymore im literally forcing myself to play overwatch just to get this stupid fucking skin i do not want to spend money on lootboxes aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
Overwatch,not_removed,yo what the fuck hey theres a hanzo up in the tower shooting your only healer im talking to you thru my mic and you pharah say ok man ill bring him down but when i walk out of spawn as zen i get an arrow thru my metal skull while you ignorant assholes ask lol wheres our healer
Overwatch,not_removed,why do i have to be the most lucky yet unlucky person i open a spooky box and what do i find a mercy legendary that isnt fucking witch its devil godfuckingdammit i have every mercy legendary now except the witch i have one day left help
Overwatch,not_removed,to the twat bastion yesterday who kept calling me out in match chat saying i was never with the team and that you never got heals a few things fuck you for abusing your supports and since i was the only support i got all of your abuse that match youre a bastion you can heal yourself between fights i was topping off the only tank we had as well as the other nonself healers you overextended every fight that is why you died frequently and didnt see me im not going out there with you one time you went tank mode and barreled into the enemy team when most everyone else on our team was dead what did i do during that i made sure you had healing orb and when you got in trouble i burned transcendence just for you in hopes you could seal the deal you did not and we both died for it then you say in chat that you got no heals during that fight what the actual fuck toward the end when you were getting wrecked by the enemy phara and we had no other hit scan on our team i switched out to ana and you immediately start giving me flak for it i killed the phara multiple times or at least forced her to disengage and still kept the team pretty well healed considering i was still the only support i recorded the match and went back and reviewed after because of your bullshit statements made me think i was ignoring you or not focusing on healing enough that was not the case youre just a little fucking prat i wish there was a way to annotate that youre a dumbass support abuser so if i ever get grouped with you again i dont go support my only regret is picking support since we needed one
Overwatch,not_removed,i hate how every single legendary skin i get is on a hero that i will never play why is it so hard to get bitch mercy
Overwatch,not_removed,i enjoy playing hanzo a lot and nothing can stop me
Overwatch,not_removed,seeing the world cup makes me sad why are brazil gold captain for crying out loud and anz automatically qualified after the shitshow they put on even if they had hard groups why do they make people vote in famous streamers instead of real pros even if its just an exhibition match on the other hand some performances like sweden thailand and russia were breathtaking
Overwatch,not_removed,wheres my goddamn witch mercy
Overwatch,not_removed,why is it that whenever i queue up quickplay to practice with a hero i dont normally use the enemy team has two meis i dont expect to win every quickplay match but it would be nice if it wasnt a miserable experience being constantly frozen in place having my cranium sized up for violent icicle insertion and if its not double mei its six fucking torbs
Overwatch,not_removed,its been over five months since the game came out and i still cannot fathom why zaryas barrier is immune to reinhardts hammer n pin even though it goes thru everyone elses shields
Overwatch,not_removed,i watch world cup it inspires me for good play im coming quick play to play some tracer and ana game my team picks bastions game enemy picks genjis game my team is just weak and i feel like i am germany awdawufidahopvabgatyawidtawyiodtawd
Overwatch,not_removed,we dont care if you want to play widowmaker for a bit we do care if you play widowmaker for the entire competitive game constantly get flanked refuse to switch and dont communicate we shouldnt have to conform to your disfunctional play this isnt an attack on your pick it is a rant on not adapting or sharing the burden of tanksupportnot being countered and stubbornness
Overwatch,not_removed,mei
Overwatch,not_removed,just got my witch mercy skin who i never play but cannot get the roadhog or reaper
Overwatch,not_removed,im really good a support and it makes me upset cause i want to play dps to have some in your face action fun but when i have to go solo mercy to output more healing and keep a team alive longer then zenyatta lucio combo its hard to justify not insta locking support
Overwatch,not_removed,i didnt get witch mercy whyyyyyyy
Overwatch,not_removed,i just want my reaper skin i never play streetpig trashmouse or support angel reaper main btw
Overwatch,not_removed,the halloween special hollywood map looks really nice too bad i only got to play it once and when i finally got it again the game was reinstantiated
Overwatch,not_removed,i must have unboxed lootboxes and figure halloween event is almost over might as well buy the ana candy emote since i probably wont unbox it so i spend credits and decide to play a few rounds i play long enough to earn a lootbox and what do you know a duplicate ana candy emote heres a credit prize you dumb bastard fml
Overwatch,not_removed,ive gotten two legendaries that werent the halloween skins one of them was even a duplicate like wtf blizzard i thought you loved me why do you have to abuse me like this please just give me junkenstein
Overwatch,not_removed,see flair
Overwatch,not_removed,can blizzard please fix roadhogs hooks not only do they go through walls but when i flash roadhog as he hooks me the hook disappears and i get teleported to roadhog where he can easily one shot me
Overwatch,not_removed,shut the fuck up about saying genji takes soooo much skill literally all you have to do is right click dash melee block then hold right click so it shoots even though the animation is still going congrats the person infront of you is dead and you took no damage maybe because its impossible to hit you and when you do you dash away like a bitch ill enjoy putting icicles into your fucking skulls you weebs
Overwatch,not_removed,fuck everyone that thinks we only need one tank one heal and then runs off to die on their own if youre staying dps you have to stay with the group fuck everyone that thinks group up means go in anyway and poke at the choke dying in the process you werent going to win a v and we arent going to win a v without your shit damage fuck everyone that doesnt focus fire targets and then thinks we need more dps heroes that isnt how this game works fuck me for thinking i could ever win a team based game and fuck me for occasionally making these mistakes too
Overwatch,not_removed,i just played a game where someone instalocked symmetra this other guy went zenyatta personally i think mercy is the best healer to have when someone is playing symmetra the guy playing zenyatta starts yelling over the mic reinhardt and lucio or this is going to be a over and over again well i picked zarya someone else picked diva and someone else went pharah for some reason our pharah ran back to the spawn and switched to mercy i would have happily gone lucio but not with a symmetra and a zenyatta and i cant play reinhardt for shit this fucking zenyatta said okay guys have fun playing a and proceeded to not play the entire game he just sat there moving and shooting so he didnt disconnect i have never been more furious playing overwatch fuck our symmetra who did terribly and fuck whoever thought supports was a good idea but seriously fuck that zenyatta i dont normally message people but i called that guy an ass worst part is he had the top icon what a cunt
Overwatch,not_removed,why the fuck did the halloween event end early i was trying to make sure i didnt get a lot of money to buy a legendary and so i didnt get to buy the rares i was going to settle for at the last moment
Overwatch,not_removed,can you please make team chat a requirement for competitive blizzard like modern warfare did for search and destroy im tired of silent teams that should just hop into team chat or plug their gosh dang microphone in to maybe yknow help the team
Overwatch,not_removed,comp is fucking broken why cant i get qued up with good players
Overwatch,not_removed,stop going winston in comp if the match hasnt even begun yet ive been losing a lot frequently primarily because people think that winston is suddenly superior to reinhardt as a front line tank for some reason they always think that theyre the best winston well ever see then they jump in get shredded even with my barrier and then complain to our team that someone else needs to switch yes our gold damage mei is definitely the problem god forbid that you switch off of harambe when the enemy team is half composed of heroes that counter you and have nothing that you counter is this a new trend or something if it is i dont like it
Overwatch,not_removed,is this where reinhardts sarcastically bitch about uhmm stand behind my shield okay
Overwatch,not_removed,i just complained in a discord but why does team quality vary so wildly during different parts of the day if i play around dinnertime hawaii time its a complete flaming trash pile but if i play around ridiculously late for the continental us i have such quality games
Overwatch,not_removed,why dont ppl use tab before asking for another tank or why people arent on point this game will go the way of starcraft
Overwatch,not_removed,i havent been able to play the halloween event once not one time im pissed
Overwatch,not_removed,i dont like competitive half the time people leave the team in the middle of a game last time it was me and someone else against a team of six also it takes longer to find a game
Overwatch,not_removed,muselk threw the game for australia
Overwatch,not_removed,ffs finally got the reaper skin after loot boxes from leveling up got it in my last one as well since i cant play the rest if the daysafter witch mercys and junkensteins qq
Overwatch,not_removed,on a losing streak thanks in part to the games where teammates quit and i have dropped a good amount over the day finally get a win and move up a whole sr it was a game of control and nobody on the other team quit game went to completion and i get sr for the win had this happen before when the other team had quit of the way through the game but for a game to go all the way to completion and still only get sr seriously why even try to rank people under no circumstances could i ever lose a game and expect to only drop down sr if the explanation for this is going to be that the ranking system expected my team to win then dont put in such unbalanced games id rather wait for a more evenly matched game so i can actually move my rank a bit when i do win solo queue is already enough of a crap shoot to win and get next to nothing is just throwing salt in the wound
Overwatch,not_removed,ill forever be salty that my friend got potg with his triple killnano boosted rather than me getting it since i killed three people and then single revived someone ill never forgive you beyond lmao
Overwatch,not_removed,i love when a a genji and a junkrat join a comp match together and think theyre so good they dont need to switch throughout the entire match when they keep getting shat on so my friends and i have to compensate for their fucking stupidity we totally didnt need a reaper when tanks were the problem genji main and junkrat main will carry right
Overwatch,not_removed,yes i get it zarya can use her shields on junkrats bombs i understand how to get around that and how to get around fighting other characters too its what happens when you play the game long enough dont be afraid of zarya for fuck sake
Overwatch,not_removed,why the fuck have i got junkeinsteins monster times but no mercy why do you forsake me game
Overwatch,not_removed,i still dont get those people that play competitive are the last few to pick and wont supporttank to help the team comp its competitive you work as a team not for yourself
Overwatch,not_removed,avg accuracy as mccree on console winrates as tracer sure ill go healer and reinhardt i am not playing ranked for the wins i just like been rekt by the enemy teams because i am too busy avoiding the ones that you are supposed to kill
Overwatch,not_removed,i only ask to be carried for once plsssssssssssss
Overwatch,not_removed,hot diggity dog im sure a huge fan of the fact overwatch has to redownload player models every time i enter a match that sure isnt a frustrating thing to deal with on my terrible internet connection when my computer is easily good enough to handle loading it clientside and on that note it sure is fucking hilarious that i fluctuate so wildly between and ping on a minute to minute basis thanks comcast
Overwatch,not_removed,played fucking three quick games in a row each of them had at least shimada brothers in my team fucking triple hanzo meta knowing we are going to lose from the getgo and when i go solo support rest of my team doesnt push objectives with me come on i am decent lucio but i simply cannot them also pls someone go tank i cannot tank and heal at the same time seriously
Overwatch,not_removed,oh fuck theres only one day left but im only missing the halloween reaper skin
Overwatch,not_removed,i grinded all the way from to prestige so that i could get that sweet sweet lootbox shower all ive ever gotten in levels since is a single voice line all other halloween items were dupes ffs blizzard stop crushing our dreams tt
Overwatch,not_removed,so the loot boxes have given me almost every halloween skin from witch mercy to pumpkinhead reaper and that junkenstein roadhog skin except the one i actually fucking want junkenstein himself what the fuck
Overwatch,not_removed,this attack is so unfocused that we had to fire the cameraman
Overwatch,not_removed,one game away from plat because i solo queue and people leave because we didnt cap the second point after our first push
Overwatch,not_removed,when sombra
Overwatch,not_removed,im tired of getting flamed for offense torbjorn if i have gold and potg and we win then shut the hell up ive only lost games with offense torb
Overwatch,not_removed,all you fuckfaces trolling because everyone is not playing properly just fucking grow up and you are even in diamond ffs
Overwatch,not_removed,playing against double symmetra makes me want to kms dont do that even if youre such hardcore pros and have the urge to troll i fucking cant counter them even as tank it makes me realise you much i suck at this game
Overwatch,not_removed,this was the worst seasonal event ever i got levels since the start of it and got only two skins being pharah and reaper i had to buy hanzos i only got shitty icons and sprays srsly i almost got all of the skins before on summer event im so unlucky
Overwatch,not_removed,i laughed at the concept of elo hell till i did console placement matches mid season with a really low rank pc rank isnt even much higher in comparison which doesnt justify me getting tilted at all but so many matches have been were defending team sits at their spawn wipes someone ragequits and game is cancelled were attacking we wipe them because theyre sitting at our spawn enemy ragequits game is cancelled ive completed placements at least with leavers mid game on both sides ive attempted maybe total
Overwatch,not_removed,when halloween ends tomorrow and you still dont have witch mercy but thank god i got the skins for hanzo and reaper when i dont have more than one hour on either of them
Overwatch,not_removed,last night i played several qp games and i literally got caught in every single trap that the enemy junkrat put down every single god damn one fuuuuyuuuuuuck meeeeeeeeeeee
Overwatch,not_removed,how the world does a reaper try to trash talk me when he cant even kill a winston ended up losing the game cause winston was just free roaming
Overwatch,not_removed,i dont trust anyone with more than mins of gameplay on hanzo and genji u all suck 💩💩💩💩
Overwatch,not_removed,fuck all u dumbasses that have absolutely no awareness especially u fucking mccree dumbshit i met a few matches ago i was healing u but this reaper went after me so i started shooting at him u looked at me shot reaper once then ignored me to die aka i wasnt able to revive our teamintense match and we lost n u had the nerve to say that im the noobfault we lost u even said u saw reaper u little bitch
Overwatch,not_removed,hey group of three zylbrad sucking mei mains on the red team you look fucking dumb when you freeze me ni hao and then miss the kill stop it its embarrassing for everyone
Overwatch,not_removed,after getting fed up with retards in quick play i queque to comp and get stuck with this junkrat main that keeps shouting in russian and does nothing of value in game no one wants to group up and fight as a team then we have a leaver in the final and decisive game fuuuuuuuuuu seriously its nice to vent like this
Overwatch,not_removed,my best friend got all halloween skins he told me yesterday oh uhinakura i still need roadhog haha and he got the fucking skin one game after saying that shit he also has gold now what do i get fucking same mercy victory rip pose times sprays please save me

Overwatch,not_removed,ana you are not a dps heal ffs mercy when you have rez dont just go for potm heal reinhardt you have a shield keep it up junkrat you might have gold damage but i can shoot up a reinhardt shield and give the enemy zarya energy all the time too pharah main btw
Overwatch,not_removed,i picked tracer on nepal after about picks and no dps you decide a widow is a great idea i think why not i precede to play the best tracer game i have ever played in my life the next rounds with a record of eliminations gold medals and insane accuracy i was constantly killing their supports and helping distract them you on the other hand got killed by a pharah flying right at you at least times that i saw you were constantly getting countered by winston genji and all sorts of flankers and widow counters you kept shouting guys im amazing bronze and elims whilst i had double that and even though of the team is asking you to switch dps you say that im a terrible tracer and the worst dps youve ever seen then at the end of the game you have the audacity to say we needed another tank after you refused to swap for whole rounds screw you buddy even the other team said i was a good tracer so fuck you widow man
Overwatch,not_removed,attack torbjörn on temple of anubis second point middel way why
Overwatch,not_removed,stop complaining about not getting xxxxx out of a loot box everything can be purchased and you all seemed to have opened boxes you have enough to buy it
Overwatch,not_removed,if i see one more basic ass overwatch gril cosplay at my school im gonna flip its like im drowning in hillary trump and dvamercy i guess its cool but could we not just do the sexy grils like whens mccree cosplay
Overwatch,not_removed,if you choose a healer at the beginning on the match and you are the only healer on the team do not fucking switch halfway through without saying anything i cant tell you the amount of times where the comp is doing just fine wth one lucio lucio gets tired of playing lucio and switches to soldier without letting us know
Overwatch,not_removed,why the fuck is mei still a goddamn hero if i get frozen one more time by a mei who snuck behind our team some fucking how im going to shoot myself in the foot so the pain of getting killed by mei is more tolerable
Overwatch,not_removed,if you want to be dps hero supreme then you better fucking bring it otherwise switch your dying tracer ass to something more useful
Overwatch,not_removed,to those people that play dps when we need a tank or healer fuck you
Overwatch,not_removed,i played as reaper and killed mei then she dropped a soul wtf blizzard literally unplayable

Overwatch,not_removed,im so done with competitive mode after mentioning to a hanzo that we already had a widowhis response from a healer thats classic im not sure my salt levels have ever been so high i was the dead fucking sea i was so full of salt
Overwatch,not_removed,maybe im the only one but i feel like level variance in other games has been better with fewer repeats seen what the fuck is wrong with the level selection in this game i play games over the course of saturday and sunday and play only different levels three out of four of my last matches were at route i hate route

Overwatch,not_removed,that shiny little icon next to your sr doesnt mean but jack and shit and jack went home the number is whats important yeah my icon is silver and im fully aware that means im pretty garbage at this game ive got no illusions but when youre matched with me in comp it doesnt matter that youve got a gold icon if your sr rank is points lower than mine that means youre silver too so when i point out that maybe attacking with bastion isnt working thats not your cue to tell me how bad i am for being silver because youre just as bad but managed to place higher
Overwatch,not_removed,mei is such a cancerous shit stop walling off me when ana nanaboosts me and i wanna be superkawaiibaitkoreandestroy of lives

Overwatch,not_removed,two events in a row i dont open any junkrat loot
Overwatch,not_removed,if you are a roadhog main i hope you die seriously every roadhog targets me all f day shit is some bullshit with that broken piece of shit hook the thing that gets me the most mad is the fact when i am in there face they miss but when i am around a corner or on a roof shit just break game physics and pulls me im a genji main btw
Overwatch,not_removed,i only got one halloween legendary out of the boxes the other legendary was a regular one so i had to spend coins on things
Overwatch,not_removed,i am truly and blissfully content with everything about this game thank you blizzard for giving us all this wonderful content to enjoy together as one big loving family
Overwatch,not_removed,how come everyone has reapers junkrats mercies and roadhogs but i only got one fucking reaper skin
Overwatch,not_removed,silver and gold are full of autists and plat is pure fucking cancer and diamond is probably just as bad why do i keep playing ranked please send help
Overwatch,not_removed,how is it possible to go in comp as a man but the you are paired with both auto pick dps characters but have less kills than the mercy on the team they refuse to play anyone else than thier hanzojunkratwidow and do absolutely nothing on any map or mode they end up having hours on only one character and still eat ass and not want to change how does spawning and dying with no chance at survival not want to make you try something else
Overwatch,not_removed,switch your character if its not working out and no im not going to switch im the only support character with gold eleminations
Overwatch,not_removed,i know youre all going to hate me because i opened my last halloween loot chest last night and i got the mercy skin the only halloween skin i hadnt gotten and wanted so so so badly and i got it not going to lie i squealed
Overwatch,not_removed,guys there were three people there all firing on that one mei how was she able to freeze just me and headshot me and then get away and not die she was the only one there and i was a roadhog he has so much health someone please send help
Overwatch,not_removed,im fine with having a bastion on my team but i swear to god if you dont move your position after you get a kill and then you get sniped because the whole enemy team knows where you are im going to kill you myself with this extremely loud and thought out run on sentence
Overwatch,not_removed,why is it so damn hard to find a game without a hanzo or widowmaker
Overwatch,not_removed,every dva player who spams happy halloween and is this easy mode in a on illios in comp i freaking hate you
Overwatch,not_removed,i hate defense and having to play healers and tanks guess what ive had to do all these past weeks so far ahhh
Overwatch,not_removed,dear diamond dps players on my team defending the last stretch of kings row hanzo its and were still getting pushed back despite our number advantage you havent ulted with zarya once maybe you should switch characters or perhaps kyo youre not seagull and youre not good mccree its and youre off trying to be a flanking genji getting picked by reaper why are you not behind the reins shield trying to help the supports aname and mercy the enemy team is what they want you retard i have healing as ana maybe instead of taking damage our dps can deal some idk just a suggestion
Overwatch,not_removed,fucking protip if i have four gold dont fucking complain that im not using a meta hero having four gold medals means that i am probably not the problem
Overwatch,not_removed,why are they buffing dva again
Overwatch,not_removed,omg fuck yeah got legendary skins mercy roadhog and junkrat reaper the one i play the least is still not droping but yesterday i got gold from one lootbox roadhog and dva legendary duplicates on the same box so do i spend gold for reaper o save for xmas its eating me alive to think what i should do
Overwatch,not_removed,i got halloween reaper on my console
Overwatch,not_removed,ok cool you went widow but why in the holy hell did you wait until seconds left to switch when you were getting owned by the genji the entire round
Overwatch,not_removed,yes thanks for telling me i suck but you suck just as much and everyone sucks too so how about we try to win the game with team work player has left the game god damn it every time
Overwatch,not_removed,junkrat involves no thinking all it isis spamming fucking grenadesi mean if i get killed by a bullshit scatter arrow to the feet at least he had to aim for fucks sake
Overwatch,not_removed,if i get hooked through one more fucking wall im flying to irvine to blizz hq to slap whoever was in charge of making his hook and dont even get me started on the roadhog mains saying there was nothing wrong with that hook people just dont understand how it works its worse for the roadhog i swear to fuck how in gods name in vain does hooks going through walls not broken
Overwatch,not_removed,save your god damn emote shit to quickplay emoting over your sleeping enemy in competitive is borderline retarded especially when the rest of the team still needs healing then blaming your team because the sleeping tracer escaped ill bloody kill you myself ana you idiot
Overwatch,not_removed,i hate dva every thing she says and does makes me cringe shes not fun to play shes not fun to fight she is just not fun and shes getting a fucking buf why she already takes no goddamn skill to play yet heros like zarya take crazy amounts of skill timing situational awareness and tons of practice and shes getting neeeerrrrffffeeddd ill never understand that they are just giving me more and more incentives to play the most brain dead hero in the game simply because she is so goddamn easy nerf this bitch seriously make her take some form of skill to play other than making her easy better yet give players incentives to play other tanks buff the other tanks and nerf the shit out of dva fuck
Overwatch,not_removed,mercy stop butt hugging one person the whole game and for fuck sake heal other people and if you wait for people to die just to get play i will find you and take a magnet to your motherboard
Overwatch,not_removed,i cant respect widow hanzo or genji mains you people disgust me
Overwatch,not_removed,why does our team have a fucking torb on attacked in ranked ndjduhshsjdk

Overwatch,not_removed,fuck this long sombra hype have had a boner since the first clue and it will only go down when she is released so i can finally bust a nut
Overwatch,not_removed,if our team needs a healer or a tank and you are the last to pick and your profile says you have most time played on a tank or a healer and you pick tracer i will fucking hunt you down and take a sledge hammer to your pcconsole or whatever you play fuck
Overwatch,not_removed,healers and tanks are the most boring goddamn heros to play im sorry but i wana kill stuff thats what i do but i cant do it if i have to keep playing tanks and healers fuck
Overwatch,not_removed,i got the reaper intro thats fucking it just nothing but coffinboi busting out of his wank station
Overwatch,not_removed,stop putting me on volskia defense
Overwatch,not_removed,hanzo can go fuck himself the stupid fucking arrow nocking cunt hits a scatter arrow at spawn and somehow one of them kills you like brett in archer hits headshots that instantly one shots you after missing about fucking arrows in a row its almost as bullshit as when youre playing mercy on attack or a tank and you have no dps to help you push or against flankers because oh look howdy de fucking do its hanzos on attack and a widowmaker almost makes me want to play diamond rated competitive only to find out its even more of a shitstain than quick play
Overwatch,not_removed,ahhhhh rein stop charging in alone hey guys switch to counter the phara yes u lost a healer because you guys wouldnt switch to counter her ahhhhh
Overwatch,not_removed,i fucking hate nepal
Overwatch,not_removed,i would appreciate if the mercy would fukcing kindly stop poketing their premadesthe fucking full health rein who has shield left
Overwatch,not_removed,can blizzard fucking do something with pharah like i know people are using her so freaking well but not me she has so many counters even mercy can counter her fml shes passively getting nerf with all the recent buff and honestly the coming patch i dont even know if thats a buff or a nerf tbh
Overwatch,not_removed,so i was playing torb on a pub and we were defending the last point we won then this high leveled mlg genji main started to rage at me for camping as torb oi genji you kept using genji you never switched you used the same fucking route over and over again the left route behind the last point of dorado you also kept trying the same strategy get in activate the reflect bumrush torb it didnt work it was a last point i was farming you like i farmed cowhides back in the day im not even good
Overwatch,not_removed,give damage some love too please blizz why do you think the metta is tanks and heals us dps mains are sitting here all alone waiting for us to actually have some goddamn use while the heal whores and bullet sponges get buffed or you know just keep nerfing damage dealers and give dva even more buffs go on fuck you to
Overwatch,not_removed,srsly fuck mei most unfun char to play against also fuck genji definetly too powerful for the mobility he has one more thing roadhogs hook is the most broken skill in game and blizz is doing shit to fix it
Overwatch,not_removed,where the flying fuck is sombra im gonna use my leet hacking skills to get to her anything at this point just sombra
Overwatch,not_removed,dear blizz get rid of your bullshit medal system these arbitrary numbers are feeding peoples lack of game knowlege
Overwatch,not_removed,if we are losing and i ask you to swap i dont care what metals you have because clearly were not winning
Overwatch,not_removed,gold medals kill streak and only deaths but junk rat watching a rein fall off a cliff gets potg
Overwatch,not_removed,phara does not need a buff shes the most silent hero the only tell you get that a phara is near is a small woosh noise when she uses her jump jet other than that nothing but in a midst of gunshots and japanese men screaming you wont hear a woosh youll here her ultimate goal off behind you and itll catch your whole team off guard and shell wipe your whole team single handedly fuck
Overwatch,not_removed,mei is nothing compared to the sheer amounts of cancer that is dva
Overwatch,not_removed,what the fuck is up with team balancing im a level and get teamed with people my level but the opposing team is all star
Overwatch,not_removed,remove the ability to leave comp games period problem solved blizz now people can shut up about leavers and move the fuck on
Overwatch,not_removed,i have been playing less because quickplay is not fun due to troll teams and bad comps
Overwatch,not_removed,why wont four of you die at once so i can get that damn mercy achievement
Overwatch,not_removed,if i play one more goddamn every one pick the same hero game i will fucking eat my soul
Overwatch,not_removed,fuck
Overwatch,not_removed,if you spend the entire game overextended minus the very last seconds or so it is definitely not everyone elses fault we lost my dude you made us play most of the game and youre not even a fucking flanker
Overwatch,not_removed,im actually sad that they havent announced any shorts for blizzcon like that would be a great venue for another excellently crafted short but nooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo
Overwatch,not_removed,donde esta sombra
Overwatch,not_removed,why is there at least one super toxic guy in every game if youre going to fucking switch to widow because youre the only healer when people still need to pick because youre super salty go the fuck back to quick play also why the hell does it seem like mcree can stun reinhardt by hitting any part of his shield
Overwatch,not_removed,fuck people in comp who use their mic to yell at other people to go healertank after they instalock genjiwidowhanzojunkrat and then never use their mic ever again
Overwatch,not_removed,why dont they just extent the event more week i mean other games still have their halloween events going or extended why not us
Overwatch,not_removed,all the people complaining about mei need to chill out
Overwatch,not_removed,god why are people geting their hopes up for tonight best case scenario we get another email this exact same thing happened on both countdowns they would never reveal her threw days before the biggest blizzard event of the year
Overwatch,not_removed,i need mariachi music playing while i ult as reaper with the mariachi skin
Overwatch,not_removed,quick question to flamers in qp what satisfaction do you guys get for yelling at a new players thats levels below you what the fuck are your godamn problems to make you so salty in a fucking qp game when you guys are playing snipers that cant hit the broad side of a roadhog thats right in front of you im trying to get my friends into overwatch but yall fuckers are making them rethink their godamn purchase and im too broke to buy another copy just to be queued up with lower levels as well these are mostly in the asian servers and au servers the most offended my friends have been is when wethey were queued up with a man stack on qp and theyve been bulliedinsulted to leave so they can make fucking room for their other friends why the fuck do these people do this i cant for the life of me understand this kind of behavior screams and jumps into the plane of nonexistence
Overwatch,not_removed,mercy fuckin switch if you keep dying before u can res betch
Overwatch,not_removed,fuck zenyatta and his fucking discord orb fucking twoball kill that always seems to headshot fuck junkrat and his fucking damage bullshit and when you try and flank him he throws a fucking shit panic bomb and launches you into fucking orbit fuck roadhogs fucking obscenely broken hook fucking hooking me after ive gone home to make dinner and dragging me around fucking walls fuck the grind for fucking loot boxes and fucking fuck my fucking overwatch life
Overwatch,not_removed,i got witch mercy times pumpkin reaper times and monster roadhog times but the last box i opened was the junkenstein skin so im good now
Overwatch,not_removed,dont even suggest i switch off mei because were on attack now god damnit she is a princess you scumbag
Overwatch,not_removed,i hate junkrats traps when i try to swift strike away from low health ive died times yo those stupid things in game
Overwatch,not_removed,ive played so much during this event its also the first time i bought lootboxes ever i didnt get witch mercy in all my previous lootboxes i got so much dupes i received enough coins to buy the skin—and i started the event with coins i bought the skin earlier tonight since id only be getting about two more lootboxes at most after that i was about to play some comp with friends i did end up getting my last two lootboxes after our games i hate you blizzard you gave me the jukest of jukes tonight
Overwatch,not_removed,my isp has a problem specifically with overwatch not blizzard not internet in the overall only f overwatch its been week since when i contacted them and things are even getting worst i can play only when very little people are playing the game in my country
Overwatch,not_removed,how about the fucking lucio that makes the roadhogzaryaany other slow hero run all the way to him rather than going back to the spawn to taxi them to the point
Overwatch,not_removed,juck funkrat and his no skill spamming having ass i swear if i appear in another killcam of his where im no where even on his screen and i die i will ddos blizzards toasters causing them to have burnt toast for weeks for conceptualizing this piece of cancer
Overwatch,not_removed,i got a nice amount of halloween drops though im mildly disappointed that i didnt get oni hanzo and ana candy emote btw i dropped witch mercy her broom provides a surprising amount of healing and boost fuck you winston i hate your tesla pew pew and your halloween emote that dropped times aaarghhh sombra where u at
Overwatch,not_removed,yes is a pretty good team build and it is perfectly natural to build a team to this strat but when the other team has a better build it is not get güd or go home you have the power to switch and counter using other team builds i now know only bitterness and sorrow when my team treats as the words of christ and they are a fool for believing in so when im sure christ himself appreciates some variety
Overwatch,not_removed,weekly reminder use your fucking mics also if you are in a group that is not full switch to team chat as a common courtesy to those players so they can communicate with you
Overwatch,not_removed,i love dva and love getting kills with her ult but when im on the other end it is naturally frustrating and im okay with that however if im backed up and behind reinhardts shield i should not die if i step behind that inch of a gap between his shield and and building
Overwatch,not_removed,i finally did it i finally got roadhogs cute achievement to knock two people off with one ult finally have i found an enemy team that decided to be coordinated they moved in together and as soon as i heard the enemy beat drop i knew it was my moment i went whole hog and they didnt die from the damage itself no for it was lucio who broke it down for them instead i sent them flying three of them i saw the achievement unlocked message and put my thumbs up emote too it was included in the potg absolutely beautiful i let out a happy scream that woke my mother from across the house finally after hours of playing my least favorite tank taking so many swigs of mystery healing juice for that extra ult charge at one point my record was self healing points and ive gotten cards for just i officially have every tank achievement im an official tank main
Overwatch,not_removed,i had to buy boxes to get coins to buy the witch skin for some reason im actually still upset not to mention i keep getting stupid rip statues
Overwatch,not_removed,why does one zarya have no counter why does one zarya have enough power to carry an enemy team with just her bubbles literally on kings row last night i am screaming to my team to kill the zarya as she is literally carrying the entire team to our defense point no one could stop her why is she literally the most broken thing in the game
Overwatch,not_removed,friendly mei i swear to god if you wall my rien charge off one more time i will make the hell you end up in after a slow painful death seem like a comforting respite from what i do to you
Overwatch,not_removed,fuck you mei
Overwatch,not_removed,none of my friends are online so i decided to solo q bc i dont care about my sr anymore but im up where did all the crappy solo q players go
Overwatch,not_removed,fuck mei
Overwatch,not_removed,nice try pc teaming up with earth in attempt to keep me from playing the halloween event the one im most excited for every year but you cant best me if this is too long then my pc tried to fuck me over so i couldnt play the event and failed though it might strike again sometime overly dramatic story time it was a long and dangerous journey a dark and stormy night a happily ever after wait that doesnt make sense mr cloud knocked out our wifi for the first three days of the event i fixed that sucker up and got a day of playtime in the event before my pc struck again hard drive started dying couldnt play anything for a week until i replaced it took some time because even my new one was out to get me but i pulled through i got another two days in the event then as a final attempt my psu turned on me again the other fucker tried the same thing last year before i replaced his ass tried to be as quiet as possible while preparing to take out my whole rig in a final move but i had a spy in there my speakers it discovered what my psu was up to and amplified the sound the psu was making through its speakers which was really fucking loud i got the message and unplugged the fucker before it caused any damage then put three fans in my pcs face when i realized he was turning into a microwave next day it didnt dare challenge me again at least not with anything as big now ive got almost all the halloween skins and the only resistance my pc is giving me is a bsod bad pool header or some shit when i turn my back to it for too long aka i leave it idle for minutes if someone knows how to fix this that would be great but ive been able to deal with it
Overwatch,not_removed,why is everybody and their mother crying for witch mercy skin
Overwatch,not_removed,if youre going to play damage in competitive please play a character you are good at anytime i get matched with randoms they play damage mostly and they are mostly ineffective and dishing damage
Overwatch,not_removed,dont charge of as rein and spam you need heals i wont fly to just you so we can both die im staying with the team die close together for a res if im not healing you during an important point take its because im waiting for you to all die its far easier to res you all with full health then trying to heal everyone at once and dying just stay close together i got your backs dont get mad sometimes the teams mei walls can mess you up but sometimes ive put it there because half the team are very low and about to die sorry if that messes up your roadhog hook or rein slam but keeping the team alive is better if of your team die just die to grouping up at spawn and going in together is far better and quicker then trickling in one by one it will stop the enemy charging their ults so much too
Overwatch,not_removed,xbox player lul
Overwatch,not_removed,competitive solo queue i go tank we get hanzo and tracer locked in i politely suggest that maybe one of hanzo or tracer could switch to a dps with abit more sustain for defense hanzo guy stays silent unexpected right pro tracer player maik says quote i main tracer believe in me d the dude has literally on tracer and on pharah what pro tracer player proceeds to disconnect in the middle of the first round never to be seen again second round all the others proceed to fuck off i am left alone i take widow and snipe from spawn though i suck as widow not much else i can do some time later disconnected for inactivity i am alone in spawn i literally shoot people inactivity fuck you maik fuck you all leavers fuck you blizzard logic where is that avoid fucktards option this game fucking needs it
Overwatch,not_removed,mercy is not good on koth i dont fucking care if we won everyone else on our goddamn team had to play around you insisting to play mercy when we had people who were perfectly happy playing lucio and zenyatta oh we need mercy for rez then use your rez more than three fucking times trying to get play of the goddamn game you fucking imbecile jesus fucking christ
Overwatch,not_removed,fuck mcree mains fuck every last one of you fuck everyone who is mei fuck everyone fuck
Overwatch,not_removed,fucking mercy mains theyre so annoying oh my gawd like protect me xdd oh my god im going to skip from teammate to teammate if youre reading this and youre a mercy main fuck you
Overwatch,not_removed,blizzard get your shit togather yo how is it balance to have gold ranks piled together with unrankeds to play against plats and golds
Overwatch,not_removed,obligatory junkrat hate edit oh and mei too
Overwatch,not_removed,why is there not a torbjorn animated short yet
Overwatch,not_removed,those ridiculous texts post with shit like whenever this hero does that heshe should say this jesus christ
Overwatch,not_removed,fuck you mei the buffs in the ptr your days are numbered
Overwatch,not_removed,dear blizzard you totally fucked up the sombra reveal to the point that i dont give a shit about it release a new hero or shut the fuck up
Overwatch,not_removed,competitive i am mercy i cant solo heal pick second healer our team has genji pharah and soldier resses people twice and they still dies loses points on ilios final point everyone reports me for talking trash help me
Overwatch,not_removed,i love reinhardt that big loveable of german power is like my main tank hes fun to play and getting nanoboosted turns me into a dark souls boss on wheels now while i do like able to crush a poor genji trying to get potg or pinning the local mercy against the wall like a german porno flick its a rather stressfull job for me to be the tank cause every enemy team wants a piece of my dick and kill me so i sometimes like to jump to other classes like junkratt able to kill a pharah out of the sky or trap a mei when she uses her shift with him is fun okay lucio cause i wanna fail trying to jet set radio my way on the point riding the walls or use mercy cause i dont gotta get yelled at cause im not getting kills just get yelled at cause i didnt rez the local reaper the problem here is that whenever i play with my friends i end up being the german engineering tank always i get do it for the team and we gotta fill our roles and play what youre best at but whenever i do tank my friends keep running ahead of my magical blue rectangle shield like valhalla is waiting for them behind the enemy bastion and whenever i tell em to please just stay behind my shield they go im not running ahead of the shield and spreading my buttcheecks to the local enemy roadhog fam its fine and i cant switch from rein to avoid the aneurysm of dealing that shit cause my friend gotta use the mercy all the damn time hours clocked in as mercy and or so minutes for anyone else and my other bud uses junkratt cause his potato pc cant let him aim shit so might aswell use the trash dps to get some kills right i love my friends i like playing with my friends and i do enjoy playing as rein with them sometimes but god damn i just wanna have a break from being a tank and fuck around as a healer or a dps sometimes yknow and i dont wanna be a prick and yell at em about it its just tiring and end up me being pissy in the matches
Overwatch,not_removed,i played with a nigger
Overwatch,not_removed,just got my witch mercy skin boizzzzzzzzzzz
Overwatch,not_removed,at least you get to play both my console and pc are broken for the time being so i havent played the halloween event once oh and guess when the replacement parts arrive november
Overwatch,not_removed,just got my witch mercy skin who i never play but cannot get the road hog or reaper
Overwatch,not_removed,you should be more concerned about the people yelling at you to switch at the very moment you select her in hero select just be thankful that no one has someone picks symmetra as their trigger
Overwatch,not_removed,i just got my
Overwatch,not_removed,i got it in one of my boxes in one of the end boxes
Overwatch,not_removed,i least you havent unlocked the fucking reaper skin goddamn times
Overwatch,not_removed,my second lootbox i got witch mercy lol
Overwatch,not_removed,damn i pull witch mercy skin on my seventh loot box
Overwatch,not_removed,but u can buy it
Overwatch,not_removed,haha i got it after lootboxes if i could i would give the skin to you i dont play mercy
Overwatch,not_removed,i mean shit i have money to spend so i just shelled out bucks got almoat all the skins sorry to hear that
Overwatch,not_removed,i am so mad for this exact reason all i want is the mercy skin and the event ends before i get home today
Overwatch,not_removed,i just got my witch mercy skin my skin and i cant even get the one skin that i really want which is the hog skin i got a bunch of witch mercys and countless legendary bastion skins why blizzard why i have minutes on bastion after hours of play ffs
Overwatch,not_removed,after lootboxes you should have more than enough coins to buy the witch mercy skin
Overwatch,not_removed,if you opened boxes you should have gotten plenty of gold to buy the skin with
Overwatch,not_removed,die together you cunts i have will die seconds before being able to get rez off and blame my team for not providing an asshole for me to crawl up inside to protect myself from the evil lucio ftfy
Overwatch,not_removed,i resed yesterday and didnt get potg because our mccree high nooned peole what shoud i do
Overwatch,not_removed,thats it youre gonna be my friend now
Overwatch,not_removed,top quality descent into incoherent gabbling i salute you sir
Overwatch,not_removed,slow but very loud clapping
Overwatch,not_removed,you have to let it go and chill out fuck it was hard writing that sentence
Overwatch,not_removed,here herethat is some on point meibabblerage
Overwatch,not_removed,people who only stick with their mains in competitive fuck you too
Overwatch,not_removed,i swear this is true logged into comp play i play almost exclusively supportwidow instalocks and guy says this is my first time playing widow so bear with me i may have cried what they say about solo q in bottom ranks is true all of it
Overwatch,not_removed,too true i had someone play as genji as they felt like it mfw they couldnt counter the enemy bastion
Overwatch,not_removed,fuck you i switched into junkrat at the point b of anubis i started shooting at a general direction saved the point with enemies on it
Overwatch,not_removed,have a nice day
Overwatch,not_removed,how do people not get that their golds are useless if we lose carrying is about doing the right damage at the right time golds dont matter if youre dead when the team needs you because your pick is getting countered losing with golds is the opposite of carrying you lost the game for your team because you didnt work with them
Overwatch,not_removed,omg i feel you idk how many times the enemy team has a competent zarya and our junkrat is just feeding her charge we get constantly mowed down by her and i ask the junkrat to switch giving my reasoning that zarya is getting too much charge from his trash damage and not getting elimed junkrats reply is but i have gold dmg lol clearly the guy doesnt know how the game works same for the mccree who spawn camps while were defending on dorado idiots
Overwatch,not_removed,fire in the hole junkrat main btw
Overwatch,not_removed,omg yes i suggest with agreement with the rest of the team to try two healers and tanks for staying power and rezzingnanoboosting after we have a leaver and get into tiebreaker rounds that junkrat was absolutely in team voice chat but refused to switch
Overwatch,not_removed,are you me literally last night this happened i asked if we could get one more tank or another healer me and my other group member were the only tank and lucio he says i hab gold damage lel and we argue in team chat for a bit my group mate and i proceed to go bastion and throw the game assholes
Overwatch,not_removed,you had your time in the meta mr balls man give the grandma sniper some time in the spotlight
Overwatch,not_removed,didnt even get to prestige once now blizzard is probably removing it all together
Overwatch,not_removed,thats what quick play should be
Overwatch,not_removed,chill out the best counter for a six stack is another six stack i recommend six more meis
Overwatch,not_removed,people keep telling me to practice in quickplay how sway how every other quickplay match ive been in has everyone going offense with maybe three junkrats with noone wanting to go healer and maybe one fucking dva as the solo tank or if its not that its the hilarious torb composition for the time
Overwatch,not_removed,what if you are autolocking a tank or something and people decide we need attack heros again with zenny as the only healer at some point you need to try working out a teamcomp
Overwatch,not_removed,im in gold right now dont act like you dont deserve this one of us one of us
Overwatch,not_removed,play zarya she can carry a team better than anyone
Overwatch,not_removed,just started trying to play solo comp seriously in this last week got placed at with friends when season started getting into plat should be achievable right team after team of no communication leavers forcing me to play support and blaming me for everything refusing to have a support comp not grouping up overextending and being spread out over the entire map fell to climbed to just fell again to im so tired of playing support mercylucioana are my top favorite heroes to play but being forced to do it nonstop with uncooperative teams is killing my love of them i swear to god this is my supervillain tracer main origin story
Overwatch,not_removed,since when has gold been considered bad im in gold and im pretty sure most people in the game are high goldlow platinum
Overwatch,not_removed,only way to get out of gold is to main an effective hero the main problem in games at that level is dps if your dps is bad on attack you will most definitely lose and if your team cant mitigate enemy dps on defense you will lose try instalocking healer on defense and dps on attack and you should see more wins also at least entertain the possibility that you are roughly where you should be
Overwatch,not_removed,all i get are legendary halloween reaper skins fuck you take my reaper skins off my handsssss ack ack ack
Overwatch,not_removed,open a box ger legendary and both are dupes fkkkkkkk
Overwatch,not_removed,i havent gotten even an epic yet consider yourself lucky
Overwatch,not_removed,my last several boxes have been gbbg gbbg ggbg gbpg ggbg gbbg g grey b blue p purple i also have not been able to play much so those are several days worth before that i have gotten legendaries one being a fucking duplicate i dont even have that many and one being currency this is some level of bullshit that i didnt expect during an event
Overwatch,not_removed,what level are you silver is btw
Overwatch,not_removed,queue up with two lower sr friends im and when i play with my silver and gold friends i carry so hard gold with zen easily on fire type of carry
Overwatch,not_removed,wait that might have been me was the silvers name twylor switft
Overwatch,not_removed,tracer scum leave my turret alone
Overwatch,not_removed,prove it take a poop in front of us
Overwatch,not_removed,athena is bae overrated scum
Overwatch,not_removed,username checks out
Overwatch,not_removed,every hanzo i played against today was a damn aimbot god i died to scatter arrow times per game but every hanzo on my team just spams ft from the point hitting nothing w h y
Overwatch,not_removed,best comment of the thread not just wellwritten but hilarious especially immediately the meta police arrives and officer genji whips out his badge weeoweeo brilliant also fuck symmetra trolls go troll in private or ai matches or with a full team you know asshole dont pull that shit in cp or qp with randoms especially when you then attempt to defend it with the total bullshit its just qp lol excuse because i guarantee you no one finds it funny
Overwatch,not_removed,gold as ana either you have no other healers on your team and youre playing dps or your dps is doing really shit
Overwatch,not_removed,today i had an attack symmetra on derado and when we lost she unironically blamed us for not using her shittily placed teleporter bitch that tele is on the end of the damn point and we havent even pushed the cart half way your tele somehow gave us a longer walk while you spent the game doing jackshit
Overwatch,not_removed,tbf a gold in healing is meaningless if youre the only healer im not saying this is what happened but there is a hypothetical reality where an ana with gold medals still contributes to a loss shes solo healer so gold is a given no matter how badly shes doing at healing she focuses on being dps and attacking more than healing now while she probably isnt the sole reason her team lost she still contributed by not performing her required role healing to the best of her ability which is why the team needed her not damageelimsprobably a paltry amount of objective time not saying that you live in that reality just saying that it could happen
Overwatch,not_removed,play more zarya zarya ftw
Overwatch,not_removed,blizzard ftw
Overwatch,not_removed,if you played her before the radius buff it was impossible to trap anyone in it and useless i think its fine it just needs to charge slower also keep lucio speed boost on near meis
Overwatch,not_removed,i am that person who never switches ama why do i do this because nobody ever picks healer except me
Overwatch,not_removed,this is me except with junkrat instead of roadhog
Overwatch,not_removed,i got duplicate witch mercies
Overwatch,not_removed,this is me except with reaper all i wanted was the damn roadhog skin and stupid me i spent most of my coins right before the event because i didnt think theyd be purchasable thanks for informing us in advance that you were changing your policy blizzard
Overwatch,not_removed,i had open like boxes before i got witch mercy blizzard keeps stealing my money
Overwatch,not_removed,that probably means youre where the mmr thinks you should be
Overwatch,not_removed,wut duplicates should give each aka credits aka enough for another legendary
Overwatch,not_removed,first starcraft then league of legends then pokemon okay not really now overwatch whats next esport for koreans to have a stranglehold over
Overwatch,not_removed,what kind of trash talk is this youre literally just complimenting people i mean its nice but yknow
Overwatch,not_removed,i killed their entire team without any help can i emote now
Overwatch,not_removed,a no overwatch problems arent real problems being a dick is a real problem ok kinda but overwatch is a real thing and people are real who are you to tell me whats a problem is my leisure time being wasted a problem because im a grown ass adult with a job i dont have time to troll people for fun like half the fucking playerbase here if you queue into the one mode of the game that expects you to play seriously only to instalock your main and ignore the team trying to communicate with you and we lose you my friend are the dick
Overwatch,not_removed,am i allowed to get salty in qp if our mei walls us in spawn
Overwatch,not_removed,do you emote after every fucking thing you do ingame just in case you accidentally do something cool that you can post to reddit hi everyone my name is swarm and im a huge dick
Overwatch,not_removed,no overwatch problems arent real problems being a dick is a real problem im going to macro this you magnificent son of a bitch
Overwatch,not_removed,why is hanzo a point like come on hanzo is my brother for gods sake
Overwatch,not_removed,and then i got blue
Overwatch,not_removed,i call bullshit
Overwatch,not_removed,on that note i have had three times in the last week where i ulted as tracer saw the animation for her throwing a vital pulse bomb only to die and respawn with my ult still up this stupid game dont show the goddamn animation of the pulse bomb leaving my hand if its not actually in play
Overwatch,not_removed,are you close to credits needed to purchase legendary skins
Overwatch,not_removed,how can you hate eidgenossen
Overwatch,not_removed,post the recording deliver op
Overwatch,not_removed,louddderrrr
Overwatch,not_removed,you are not worthy because you called her a bitch
Overwatch,not_removed,russias shadowburn is godlike with the genji gameplay
Overwatch,not_removed,as a dva main zarya makes me want to hang myself from the mech she is such a hard counter but i cant switch off to hard counter her because she doesnt have one
Overwatch,not_removed,too soon
Overwatch,not_removed,speak louder
Overwatch,not_removed,or the fangs spray
Overwatch,not_removed,im sorry to hear that mr
Overwatch,not_removed,you can check it out in custom games specifically
Overwatch,not_removed,lol that reference
Overwatch,not_removed,does that make you the good player
Overwatch,not_removed,you are getting queued with just as many good players as the average enemy team in all your losing games you are one of the common factors
Overwatch,not_removed,but miro did it he one v oned a reaper and won
Overwatch,not_removed,¿donde está sombra
Overwatch,not_removed,kids and more casual players be sleeping yo
Overwatch,not_removed,how come
Overwatch,not_removed,south korea vs australia wad an inside job
Overwatch,not_removed,fucking witch fucking mercy and here i have fucking dupe pumpkin reapers
Overwatch,not_removed,i cant hear youu
Overwatch,not_removed,cant hear ya pussy
Overwatch,not_removed,no one is afraid of zarya except just after shes fully charged herself on a couple of stray junkrat bombs
Overwatch,not_removed,well i would if there was a fucking healer or tank in the team do you think i like playing that heavy armored germanno i rather be in tracers tight suit right now
Overwatch,not_removed,well i would if there was a fucking healer or tank in the team do you think i like playing that heavy armored germanno i rather be in tracers tight suit right now
Overwatch,not_removed,dont worry love ill carry you
Overwatch,not_removed,i cant hear you
Overwatch,not_removed,have you tried roadhog he can tank and heal at the same time s
Overwatch,not_removed,neverrrrrrrrrr
Overwatch,not_removed,did you get potg or did your limp swedish meatball of a corpse get potg
Overwatch,not_removed,im even more happy that i got bastion and symmetra instead of mercy
Overwatch,not_removed,你好
Overwatch,not_removed,dude good job as a fledgling tracer player myself thats what i aspire to get in a game
Overwatch,not_removed,i dont even understand his argument like what
Overwatch,not_removed,what we cant hear your lovely compliment over the giant mountain of cancerous salt
Overwatch,not_removed,id buy reaper its limited and youll probably get in coins if you play between now and then
Overwatch,not_removed,every single person in comp plays dps they dont need more love
Overwatch,not_removed,you have to use all caps
Overwatch,not_removed,people can just force close their overwatch
Overwatch,not_removed,i enjoy those games and they cut up the monotony of average games where you get a widow a hanzo pro genju junkrat and a reaper
Overwatch,not_removed,you fucker i want pumpkin reaper
Overwatch,not_removed,the thing about zarya is she becomes more powerful if you attack her bubbles so dont
Overwatch,not_removed,restart the queue after a minute to get more balanced games no guarantee but it helps
Overwatch,not_removed,you got what you paid for stop whining and acting so entitled
Overwatch,not_removed,speak up damnit
Overwatch,not_removed,i cant hear you
Overwatch,not_removed,you must be platinum or lower if you cant deal with mei btw i am a mei main kek
Overwatch,not_removed,if you dont give a shit why are you complaining you dont have to join the arg or anything and just use the filter to turn off anything sombra look like they success in making you hype though
Overwatch,not_removed,did you talk trash
Overwatch,not_removed,good release bro
Overwatch,not_removed,i am so so sorry for your loss d hopefully the inevitable christmasholiday event will treat you well to make up for it
Overwatch,not_removed,rip
Overwatch,not_removed,thats hilarious i dont wanna rub it in but yhe brawl was pretty fantastic
Overwatch,not_removed,everything else is like hrs or less
Overwatch,not_removed,you need roadhog too i have dupes of him too argh
Overwatch,not_removed,i have had witch mercys now and had to buy the roadhog skin still no reaper i hate my life
Overwatch,not_removed,oh i get that plenty im less concerned about that because i can just ignore them and move on i cant just ignore a mei wall preventing me from getting to the point much as i wish i could walk through it like a rein shield
Overwatch,not_removed,can i trade you my seven fucking seven halloreapers for one of them please
Overwatch,not_removed,you break my heart man
Overwatch,not_removed,no instead i have unlocked it seven times blizz wants me to embrace my inner edge apparently
Overwatch,not_removed,i did but that doesnt lessen the salt of getting multiple of everything except the only skin i wanted in the entire god damn event
Overwatch,not_removed,i did but that doesnt lessen the salt of getting multiple of everything except the only skin i wanted in the entire god damn event
Overwatch,not_removed,die together you cunts i have will die seconds before being able to get rez off and blame my team for not providing an asshole for me to crawl up inside to protect myself from the evil lucio i will res the entire team only to line up with a perfect enemy man zarya ult and high noon
Overwatch,not_removed,complain in match chat because that little shit totally robbed you
Overwatch,not_removed,more importantly ya gotta relax
Overwatch,not_removed,agreed on the babblerage nice term by the way but its actually hear hear httpsenmwikipediaorgwikihearhear
Overwatch,not_removed,im just sayin as a lowly casual maybe it wouldnt hurt if people had a couple characters they were comfortable playing ready for comp test your shit out in qp fam
Overwatch,not_removed,they main them for a reason
Overwatch,not_removed,you sure hate me d
Overwatch,not_removed,i main zen and ana fuck you too sorry for being helpful
Overwatch,not_removed,hi
Overwatch,not_removed,what speak louder mate
Overwatch,not_removed,that was luck not a direct result of making a good strategic choice if your team was better at countering the enemy comp you wouldnt have been scrambling to hold b last minute
Overwatch,not_removed,nothing rustles my jimmies more as a zenyatta than being chased down by a fully charged zarya what the fuck do i do i cant kill the bitch so i just accept my fate and shoot my fucking crystals at her hoping i can chunk her down enough
Overwatch,not_removed,are you me i had this exchange last night
Overwatch,not_removed,zenyatta was meta for like a week before ana showed up he didnt get a meta at all
Overwatch,not_removed,why cant we have both
Overwatch,not_removed,exactly but in its current form competitive is more relaxing because you know theyre not going to have six fucking meis
Overwatch,not_removed,have two forms of quick play so people can still dick off in one form but not the other
Overwatch,not_removed,dont move thats a fantastic idea ill try it out freeze blocking them off mei pun
Overwatch,not_removed,moderation spend a third of games filling needed roles another third playing something you like that also contributes and the final third playing whatever the hell you want even if you suck at it it wont be as efficient as always playing exactly what you want but you will win more and you wont be an asshole
Overwatch,not_removed,after i broke i got to have the true overwatch experience players worked as a team hardly any leavers or trolls and the matches were challenging which helped me improve as a player when you get below it is the exact opposite of this the majority of the time
Overwatch,not_removed,i am actually already doing this started playing as zenyatta main earlier this week and i am seeing an improvement a slow improvement but an improvement nonetheless and i use to be sr but got knocked down trying to help a friend level up got knocked down all the way to due to leavers trolls and bad randoms after that
Overwatch,not_removed,i need the reaper skin but all i get is witch mercy
Overwatch,not_removed,hey at least you get credits from duplicates during this halloween event ive gotten nevermore mariachi and pumpkin and i dont even like reaper and even if i did like reaper i was already happy with blackwatch god i hope this game gets trading one day so i can give all these away
Overwatch,not_removed,you must embrace the edge
Overwatch,not_removed,about school is kind of really fucking me sideways rn so leveling doesnt happen too much with me
Overwatch,not_removed,im sure this is fun but you make it way harder for the mmr to put people in games with you and its not fair to the people youre stomping and it fucks over the people who get teamed up with the friends youre boosting later on because they dont actually belong at that sr hopefully blizz tightens the queue gap requirement so you cant do this also how the hell did you find a silver and why in gods name would you add them
Overwatch,not_removed,i dunno were you mercy paired with a mccree
Overwatch,not_removed,its to eat a bar of soap
Overwatch,not_removed,hanzo ulties from spawn work as intented firework hanzo skins confirmed
Overwatch,not_removed,yesterday i literally did a degree blind headshot on a tracer hanzo is broken as all hell
Overwatch,not_removed,that is feasible that is assuming your team consists of this that said bastion that is trying to set up sentry mode in the very same damn place only to die immediately a japanese cyborg ninja that is always trying to flank the enemy team has the i need healing voice com macroed to each skill he has and tries to go in with his sword only to die a japanese tattooed bowman that stands in one place trying to line up the perfect arrow shot he also happens to be the brother of said japanese cyborg ninja an edgelord hooded man that also only tries to flank the enemy team only to die as well he also happens to have a name that would be on the httpstwittercomreapernames twitter page a german armored man that always tries to charge into six enemies to get a sick ram kill only to be killed you as ana happy now
Overwatch,not_removed,we actually had rein mercy boosting bastion a zarya and a genji on our team and tbh im in master i know how to aim thank you
Overwatch,not_removed,nope everyone quitted and the game calculated ana stats only and gave gold medals
Overwatch,not_removed,being gold with healing damage and elims is about average also me being solo on point with minutes and obj kills contributed more than this useless fuck
Overwatch,not_removed,now im not saying youre wrong cause thats generally true but if ana is capable of catching the other players in damage they are all shit she deals like damage per minute if she gets gold in elims she should be healing more if she gets gold in damage jdurudjsneijtue
Overwatch,not_removed,i played hours in quick play before jumping to competitive because i wanted to practice all heroes and be flexible guess what do i play in comp lucio and rein because everbody chooses dps
Overwatch,not_removed,and if you are able to force another player to take healer they spend the whole game playing dps anyway put your gun away and heal me mercy im sick of trying to jump into your snipe fire ana
Overwatch,not_removed,fuuuckhfsjlltsxbklbf
Overwatch,not_removed,i know that but i want to get higher and get better
Overwatch,not_removed,it gives coins for a duplicate legendary ffs it was witch mercy and ifrit zenyatta i love those skins but whyy twice
Overwatch,not_removed,its not over yet i think finland might be able to hold them off
Overwatch,not_removed,lee carvelos putting challenge
Overwatch,not_removed,sorry im not very good at this im from canada thanks for correcting me
Overwatch,not_removed,as a tank no killing the whole other team was your job who did you think was going to do it the dps
Overwatch,not_removed,no the only acceptable solution is to track the mei down in real life and build a real ice wall directly in front of their front door
Overwatch,not_removed,no mei is love never bitch about her annoyance
Overwatch,not_removed,there is another door
Overwatch,not_removed,i wish it was but atleast im level now so i suppose i cant really complain too much its just kinda annoying ya know
Overwatch,not_removed,out of curiosity why does it take you so long to choose a character if youre gonna pick hog anyway why leave last choice for those who want to play flex
Overwatch,not_removed,well ill pick lucio and give up my favorite hero but this comment really goes out to the reaper fanboys who sits there waiting for his ult before he starts playing
Overwatch,not_removed,not even my computer died right before the update
Overwatch,not_removed,because i didnt get it
Overwatch,not_removed,you have been judged
Overwatch,not_removed,does it involve penis stuff
Overwatch,not_removed,louder
Overwatch,not_removed,yes
Overwatch,not_removed,this makes sense logically but does not reflect the significance of random factors like mood and tilt and what heroes a given player is capable of playing winning in competitive under the current system is not about individual skill its about which team mitigates the weaknesses of their bads the best theres nothing the mmr can do to work around that without drastically increasing queue times the only way to fix comp is to somehow instigate a change in the mindset of the players
Overwatch,not_removed,let me be salty in peace
Overwatch,not_removed,cheers love
Overwatch,not_removed,roadhog is the ultimate asshole only cares about himself just like those hanzogenji mains also i find your s highly unnecessary
Overwatch,not_removed,i did i dropped a turret behind them upgraded it popped molten core ran in and got a and didnt die until after mc had ended
Overwatch,not_removed,thank you very much im sure youll get there some day with lots and lots of practice
Overwatch,not_removed,i know right seriously he seemed to think that since he died once the heals werent adequate therefore the healers were bad and thats why we were losing this is life in comp playits everything youve ever heard and worse
Overwatch,not_removed,nope i just said jesus genji change youre not doing anything for the team
Overwatch,not_removed,my top two are road hog and reaper mercy has like minutes c
Overwatch,not_removed,i regularly play anathere is nothing scarier than a boosted sym nothingthough mei can be a close second if she knows what shes doing
Overwatch,not_removed,duplicate reaper legendaries arent even enogh to pay for half of a witch mercy what the fuck blizzard
Overwatch,not_removed,embrace your curse you are already in the crying corner
Overwatch,not_removed,mercy main btw
Overwatch,not_removed,thank you you understand me
Overwatch,not_removed,dammit mercy now is not the time youre a doctor not an english teacher
Overwatch,not_removed,i dont give a duck what you main if we need a healer you only knowing how to use hanzo is not helpful
Overwatch,not_removed,too true i had someone play as genji as they felt like it mfw they couldnt counter the enemy bastion
Overwatch,not_removed,fuck off with that shit
Overwatch,not_removed,preach gurl preach
Overwatch,not_removed,have you ever heard of clutch picks junkrat is a strategic choice in ops described situation it isnt luck if you know the enemy is clustered and you can get a lot of spam damage to distract them while your team respawns and gets back to the fight
Overwatch,not_removed,he was meta for all of season and hes still really good
Overwatch,not_removed,you can and its pretty good for pumping out ungodly amounts of damage on the enemy team charging in with a zen orb and ana healing towards ult makes for happy hammer times
Overwatch,not_removed,my rule of thumb is no more than one comp loss per hour if i lose i go play quickmatch for a bit it takes some willpower but goes a long way to prevent losing streaks
Overwatch,not_removed,i need the witch mercy but all i get is the reaper skin
Overwatch,not_removed,amazingly i have all the halloween skins ive bought only one which was reinhardt heroic skin
Overwatch,not_removed,yeaaaahhhhhhh
Overwatch,not_removed,ahhhh what are you looking at
Overwatch,not_removed,irl friend and its quickplay
Overwatch,not_removed,never stop fighting for what you believe in
Overwatch,not_removed,thats true its why i said shes not the only reason but definitely contributed in this scenario
Overwatch,not_removed,its quickplay pick dps just to practice aimabilities it doesnt matter if you lose becyas eyou have no healer its quickplay
Overwatch,not_removed,so does fucking everyone but if everyone was higher whats the fucking point
Overwatch,not_removed,maybe sweden can beat them too
Overwatch,not_removed,shit
Overwatch,not_removed,of course not but theyre still going to get play of the game
Overwatch,not_removed,yay
Overwatch,not_removed,the only way to fix comp is to somehow instigate a change in the mindset of the players every team needs a leader learn to be that leader learn to motivate and guide your team to victory be the hero they need
Overwatch,not_removed,same
Overwatch,not_removed,if it makes you feel any better almost every nonevent legendary i get is for dva when i have literally minutes played on her
Overwatch,not_removed,btw what
Overwatch,not_removed,what did you say i cant hear you
Overwatch,not_removed,what if i main primarily play lucio
Overwatch,not_removed,what if i play dps zenyatta
Overwatch,not_removed,that sounds like they changed to help the team comp ive had to do this exact thing in qp because no one else was switching i have a warning that i was a terrible genji but we needed to get a job done i failed at doing the job but that is besides the point
Overwatch,not_removed,junkrat was actually a bad strategic choice even if it worked out junkrat is fine for point a anubis but should be switched out for reaper or a faster hero on point b defense
Overwatch,not_removed,you mean the season where he had health and a useless ult
Overwatch,not_removed,wot no he wasnt that was lucio and mercy meta i got flamed every time i locked zen
Overwatch,not_removed,rip us
Overwatch,not_removed,i got the reaper skin fucking times
Overwatch,not_removed,you got to believe in a lucio flair
Overwatch,not_removed,find out next time on dragonball z
Overwatch,not_removed,thanks for your response i play healers a lot i just like the role were out there but were a rare breed mercys okay but i prefer brunettes
Overwatch,not_removed,does it involve penis stuff
Overwatch,not_removed,just got a leg and it was a widowmaker skin thanks blizzard for getting me excited
Overwatch,not_removed,what if there are two of you on a team
Overwatch,not_removed,they started as genji admitting they never played him other team had a bastion later overwatch logic
Overwatch,not_removed,also at the time where is discord orb made any tank a health squishy hero to anyone attacking them
Overwatch,not_removed,rip
Overwatch,not_removed,same here
Overwatch,not_removed,roadhogs have preditable timing i can usually dodge the hook
Overwatch,not_removed,likely chance you are good with all supports depending on what sr you are at
Overwatch,not_removed,heals and speed always
Overwatch,not_removed,so zenyatta made enemies into slightly tankier versions of himself
Overwatch,not_removed,ooohh thats a good spot
Overwatch,not_removed,thassa fine howdyado
Overwatch,not_removed,hooley dooley
Overwatch,not_removed,an even better spot
Overwatch,not_removed,the facial flexes in this one have glitched leaving a big smile on his face whilst being in the worst pain a man can inflict on himself
Overwatch,not_removed,look again the mouth glitched
Overwatch,not_removed,i thought this was hilarious original video
Overwatch,not_removed,is bazzagazza
Overwatch,not_removed,loving hook
Overwatch,not_removed,its crazy how people complain about mcree when hanzo played correctly is more scary and able to take over games
Overwatch,not_removed,httpsgfycatcomdirectcorruptaustraliansilkyterrier
Overwatch,not_removed,to be fair hanzo has a way higher ceiling and it is incredibly hard to consistently play him well every game whereas for mccree he at least can always rely on his skirmishing combo
Overwatch,not_removed,im pretty sure a team kill is when you kill all six players on the opposing team and the screen says team kill i saw this on neither of your videos
Overwatch,not_removed,it came up after the gif ends on the hanzo one you can see them all in the kill feed i actually dont remember if there was a team kill after the other the person might have respawned already one died outside the point and i grabbed the heal before jumping in the window there
Overwatch,not_removed,jeez louise papa cheese that was gnarly
Overwatch,not_removed,bro i thoroughly hate facing mccrees of your caliber
Overwatch,not_removed,this happened to me once but with junks tire i got the achievement for it too
Overwatch,not_removed,the timing on that ice wall though
Overwatch,not_removed,kek misses shots in a row to mercy
Overwatch,not_removed,patch note you now think you killed symmetra but didnt
Overwatch,not_removed,symmetra buff was too big
Overwatch,not_removed,funny enough this was the end of the game before the ddos happened
Overwatch,not_removed,friends make it pretty reliable
Overwatch,not_removed,if you like teamplay fps games that arent just about twitch aiming then yeah its great me i was a big and tribes player also got into hawken and dirty bomb and overwatch is fantastic got over hours in pharah because shes about as close to tribes as im gonna get in modern fps and she can pub stomp like none other
Overwatch,not_removed,did you regret buying the game hahahaha no hours in and i dont have any plan stopping
Overwatch,not_removed,i picked it up for and i was somewhat starting to get bored of it since i didnt have any friends who played it when i got it after my friends did buy it and i gotta tell you a single session of us playing it together revitalized my motivation to play the game and i love it
Overwatch,not_removed,i regret buying it but that is no slight against the game itself i think its a great game very well puttogether no my regret is because i really just cant get myself into pvponly arena games for more than a few weeks before i get bored i was hoping because it was blizzard and the lore and world are great that i would get past that but sadly no such luck i spent more hours watching streams of it than i ended up playing the actual thing so if youre worried about getting bored of it just ask yourself if a youve enjoyed a pvp shooter for an extended time before b even if not is a game worth it if you enjoy it for say hours there are a lot of great games out there that only take a weekend to finish
Overwatch,not_removed,i played a couple hours or beta and was convinced enough to preorder it im now pretty well past hours so im at less than per hour of gameplay more and more of my friends are getting it and im itching for season to start so yeah id say its worth it
Overwatch,not_removed,if youre playing solo and dont like ranked ranked mode then maybe you shouldnt i fking love this game but mainly because im competitive and its ranked mode is really fun i get bored if im soloing and playing qp real fast but thats just me
Overwatch,not_removed,not even close
Overwatch,not_removed,i paid for it and i still play it but if you dont have friends to play it with then dont bother
Overwatch,not_removed,id only regret if there was never competitive other than that game is life
Overwatch,not_removed,i bought it for and havent regretted it since all my friends say the same you wont know what it is like until you try it
Overwatch,not_removed,it is worth way more than bucks to me level and no intention of stopping so i got many weeks of entertainment out of it for a measly bucks ok to be honest because i bought lootboxes
Overwatch,not_removed,its worth bucks but its not worth buying lootboxes i am level i am getting really bored of this game already rank last season
Overwatch,not_removed,another thing about the content angle a lot of games you wont be switching out equipment times in a match youll specialize in whatever youre into and basically play with the same content over and over with overwatch given how key heroswapping is you actually end up playing with a lot more content on a regular basis than a lot of other games equipment loadouts and counting
Overwatch,not_removed,same situation as well i started the game just me playing and when finally my friends got hooked in the game i started enjoying it more and i even enjoyed solo queuing more as well
Overwatch,not_removed,i probably dont enjoy solo queuing as much as you do unless its really just to dick around in qp especially since competitive hasnt rolled around yet but yeah i do enjoy this game a lot more after playing with friends
Overwatch,not_removed,uifaptomccree anything
Overwatch,not_removed,nice scar reference
Overwatch,not_removed,she wasnt necessarily cloaked
Overwatch,not_removed,oh wow
Overwatch,not_removed,oh hi johnny ididnt know it was you
Overwatch,not_removed,he didnt jump
Overwatch,not_removed,its bullshit they did not hit them they did naht
Overwatch,not_removed,i have zero regrets picking that name considering half the comments here have the room references
Overwatch,not_removed,errbody betray me im fed up with this warld
Overwatch,not_removed,thats a highlight
Overwatch,not_removed,he also didnt get the kills so it doesnt matter
Overwatch,not_removed,what happened
Overwatch,not_removed,lucio gets potg while the kills are all pharas
Overwatch,not_removed,pharah got potg most likely lucio assisted it
Overwatch,not_removed,am the pharah in that game can confirm
Overwatch,not_removed,oh hi mark
Overwatch,not_removed,is it confirmed ddos or just shitty servers
Overwatch,not_removed,your submission has been deleted the reasons being your submission was already submitted in a very similar fashion and therefore counts as a duplicate if you have any questions please state them in an answer to this post for concerns or to contact the whole staff please with the removal of my submissionmessageim writing to you about the following submission issue is for more information please consult httpswwwredditcomroverwatchwikirules
Overwatch,not_removed,you didnt post the scores what were they
Overwatch,not_removed,currently lvl decided to copy down levels and average them every game competitive points ahead it looks like im filler in a lot of premades when i go solo
Overwatch,not_removed,is not significant and given you can swing a level in one game thats actually incredibly equal
Overwatch,not_removed,reposting this wont change how little people cared
Overwatch,not_removed,why are you such a bitter bob
Overwatch,not_removed,i wasnt talking to you boy
Overwatch,not_removed,kek
Overwatch,not_removed,based on how they neutered mccree blizzard is likely to make his regular arrow fly straighter and make his scatter arrow so weak it is effectively useless
Overwatch,not_removed,ive always been confused by what makes hanzo so bad in my personal experience hes always been the easiest sniper to use his special arrows are quite nice and the only things i find underwhelming are his ult literally might as well not give it a hitbox since he announces that hes using it with plenty of time for every opponent to make themselves dinner take a nap and tunnel far enough below ground with a plastic spork to avoid it before the dragons come out and the fact that hes completely horrible at close range i know im in the minority by thinking that hanzo isnt as bad as everyone says he is but still i do think he needs something new but i dont think it needs to be too much maybe make rightclicking with him launch a threearrow fanshaped burst like genji to help him better deal with closerange enemies
Overwatch,not_removed,hanzo just needs a way to escape even without aiming which slows him down he cant outrun any other hero he runs at default speed turning your back and running up a wall does nothing ill continue to play as him as often as i can in hopes he gets buffed one day ill be a great hanzo im good now but one day someone will love me p
Overwatch,not_removed,torbjorn would be proud
Overwatch,not_removed,the direct to dvd sequel to
Overwatch,not_removed,paying homage to torbjörn i see
Overwatch,not_removed,that laughter d
Overwatch,not_removed,right its very infectious
Overwatch,not_removed,did i forgot to mention that mei needs to be nerfed like right now
Overwatch,not_removed,ladies and gentlemen of reddit i give you the mccrab
Overwatch,not_removed,im having spycrab flashbacks
Overwatch,not_removed,reach for the sky we now
Overwatch,not_removed,crab people crab people
Overwatch,not_removed,it seems that to escape extinction the spycrab has taken on a new form upointyhatman must take record of this immediately
Overwatch,not_removed,this brings me back to the good ol days i wonder if well also see a hoovylike creature in overwatch
Overwatch,not_removed,this is idiotic nbsp i love it
Overwatch,not_removed,that made me laugh more than it should have
Overwatch,not_removed,overwatch is slowly turning into
Overwatch,not_removed,who is he waving to
Overwatch,not_removed,
Overwatch,not_removed,mcdonalds corp would like to apologize for hiring woll smoth as our press announcer and with that out of the way wed like to reintroduce the mcrib available now for a limited time only
Overwatch,not_removed,this is the spycrab
Overwatch,not_removed,flash like crab bang like people
Overwatch,not_removed,people kinda already do that with bastion in my experience
Overwatch,not_removed,the enemy team of course
Overwatch,not_removed,ok you win
Overwatch,not_removed,you dont you paid for the boxes and used them
Overwatch,not_removed,lmao
Overwatch,not_removed,is this humor is op years old find out next episode of narutos bizzare z
Overwatch,not_removed,i tried to refund lottery tickets once the guy called me a retard and told me to fuck off
Overwatch,not_removed,how get rich ez open a few boxes get the stuff in the box refund instant profit
Overwatch,not_removed,you forgot to mark this as humor
Overwatch,not_removed,should this have a humor falir is op actually autistic find out next week on dragonball z
Overwatch,not_removed,youre more likely to get better stuff if you buy boxes
Overwatch,not_removed,i think hunter x hunter is far superior
Overwatch,not_removed,what the fuck does autism have to do with this
Overwatch,not_removed,well i guess the rng broke then i only got garbage wasted my money on a shitty rng system
Overwatch,not_removed,i just threw some names together
Overwatch,not_removed,are you licks lips triggered
Overwatch,not_removed,are you nine or something
Overwatch,not_removed,nine and a half
Overwatch,not_removed,had a today let me tell you how fun that was
Overwatch,not_removed,it would be difficult to add this in though because even if you did punish players in groups pugs could still make a deal to have one person leave so people dont get a loss i dont see blizzard doing something like this
Overwatch,not_removed,do you understand how hard it would be to convice one person that you have never met in your life before to take one for the team you must be joking when you say this if this ever happened which it of course will it will be a rare case and nothing to be worried about

Overwatch,not_removed,dude you need to chill out
Overwatch,not_removed,huge rant
Overwatch,not_removed,how long did this take you to write
Overwatch,not_removed,her biggest utility is her wall not picking off wandering players who are clueless to team positioning
Overwatch,not_removed,mei is bae
Overwatch,not_removed,whoever thought that the mei character skill design was a good idea must have been completely brain dead she is literally a detriment to the game and it would be considerably better off without her but of course blizzard can do no wrong so all legitimate criticism is discarded and downvoted by the lebbit hivemind
Overwatch,not_removed,im going to assume you just started playing yesterday
Overwatch,not_removed,you have to let it go
Overwatch,not_removed,even if shes caught off position or you are actively reaping she still has ice block so you are wastin massive time and attention for just this one hero
Overwatch,not_removed,sorry sorry sorry sorry sorry not sorry
Overwatch,not_removed,lol mei is annoying but easy to deal with you wanna talk about no skill fucking look at junkrat high damage at no fucking risk you spam into the objective until everything that is on it dies oh dont go right on it cool ill just side stepoh wait it bounced an killed me fine ill take it on at close range concussion mine kills me long range oh he can hit me too how can i fight him at least with mei its about grouping up junkrat can kill a group cause it shots non tanks so what the fuck i just have to get him from behind but doesnt matter moment he turns around he fucking insta gibs me no skill all reward at least with mei you have to have decent aim and decent survivability with junkrat hold primary fire and sometimes use the mine congratulations you won
Overwatch,not_removed,ಠಠ
Overwatch,not_removed,i mean mei kinda fucking blows
Overwatch,not_removed,something like hours p youll be shocked to hear that i started writing this when i took a break from overwatch after a losing streak guess which character kept killing me go on guess
Overwatch,not_removed,my friends and i have a sort of running list of changes were hoping to see for some heroes for example for torbjorn our most common frustration is his turrets habit of suddenly snapping degrees to snipe you through a crack away in the tenth of a second youre visible so a noninstant turn speed andor slight delay half a second before firing the first shot after it hasnt fired for say seconds ie requiring it to spin up like a minigun would fix that bs behavior without nerfing how well it functions in a teamfight when we get to talking about how to fix mei it pretty much comes down to give symmetra a force field wall and now you can remove mei from the game because otherwise her primary fire is mostly good for countering dodgy closerange heroes which is also what symmetras primary fire does in a way that also doesnt require precise aim and keeps the time pressure for attacker kill mei fast before youre frozen kill symmetra fast before her beam charges and that does away with the frustration and noncompetitive nature of a freeze beyond that meis in this weird place where she has health and no armor or shields but with a statisheal so shes some kind of squishy selfsustaining offtank melee duelist that use case is already more than adequately satisfied by reaper unfortunately meis gotten so much traction among dipshits that a move like removing her from the game entirely would be hugely unpopular itd have been best if they never included her in the first place but now that shes in theres really no good way of phasing her out without facing backlash from the horde of losers who main her
Overwatch,not_removed,it was for the ice joke someone had to do it
Overwatch,not_removed,she takes a lot of skill to play well i am willing to bet she didnt walk into your entire team and kill one person she is great at picking off people on their own but she dies very fast when focused by multiple people if you die from her a lot then stick with your team there is a ton of things you can do to kill her just dont get out played by missing a hook or flashbang
Overwatch,not_removed,was it hanzo
Overwatch,not_removed,genji d
Overwatch,not_removed,roadhog or were you trick shot by a widow that happened to me once i rage quit and didnt play for a week
Overwatch,not_removed,torbjorn
Overwatch,not_removed,guess my joke wasnt as good she blows her gun blows ice or snow whatever guess im not as punny as you
Overwatch,not_removed,as a ratkin of the junky variety that bitch never freezes me one grenade to the face and a mine to the feet means either satan is dead or im at least very far away now
Overwatch,not_removed,ooh sorry my bad xx
Overwatch,not_removed,i know the doubts that plague you
Overwatch,not_removed,there is chaos within you
Overwatch,not_removed,you are your own worst enemy
Overwatch,not_removed,rep
Overwatch,not_removed,ive noticed potg usually follows this order the symetra who pressed left shift and left clicked a few times the bastion that hid near the spawn point and pressed left click the hardcore torbhanzowidowmaker player that did a billion jumps and crazy stuff the explosion ult type character like dva tracer phara etc who got lucky right in front of the spawn pointfound a group that couldnt scatter in the confusion in almost every game i play if theres a symetra i know shes going to get potg unless all she does is stand around and never set up turrets i dont know if shes really super op her turrets take like a hit to destroy but shes definitely high power
Overwatch,not_removed,
Overwatch,not_removed,did they go bastion at some point did the reaper just run up to you and spend three minutes shooting at your shield
Overwatch,not_removed,not really it was a normal game in eichwalde
Overwatch,not_removed,its because you didnt send that email to of your best friends back in grade
Overwatch,not_removed,im pretty sure youre guaranteed to get a legendary every packs so with luck you could get something in packs time
Overwatch,not_removed,ive opened about boxes and havent gotten the skin i wanted it is luck with no guaranteed payout ever
Overwatch,not_removed,true i open and got all skins except
Overwatch,not_removed,the loot is determined on receiving the lootbox thus they cant roll any unreleased items
Overwatch,not_removed,nope
Overwatch,not_removed,loot boxes in the live version wont contain loot from the upcoming patch
Overwatch,not_removed,thank you for the help
Overwatch,not_removed,put them in positions to stop flankers and set them up again as you move turrets and teleporters can also be placed on the payload
Overwatch,not_removed,is a size of wrench knowing the teams sense of humor and incessantly teasing numbers since is they probably threw that in on purpose so that people would freak
Overwatch,not_removed,is the next number for the new hero
Overwatch,not_removed,i would love for it to be like the tracer trail and mean jack dick

Overwatch,not_removed,hey reinhardts i dont play overwatch but my girlfriends last name is guy
Overwatch,not_removed,hey overwatch i dont play girlfriend but my guys last name is reinhardt
Overwatch,not_removed,hey girlfriend i dont front page of reddit but my confuseds last name is overwatch so like whenever posts make it to guy i get really reinhardt
Overwatch,not_removed,yes i agree and they need to put hanzo into the offensive section it would make him a better hero
Overwatch,not_removed,she would probably be picked less then
Overwatch,not_removed,dont belittle my symmetra p she is my love check my video
Overwatch,not_removed,in her current form yah a stance change would be good but either way she is in dired need of buffs now if thoes buffs replace her proton shield with somthing both useful and more support like im fine with that if they replace her ult or at least add somthing to it to make it useful on most maps that also help fill the support role im also fine with that but defense or support she needs buffes in just about every aspect of her being
Overwatch,not_removed,really i dont think so i think they should stop classifying him as a sniper because most of the time he is in mid range just spamming
Overwatch,not_removed,whoosh
Overwatch,not_removed,having the same exact issue here it can happen during normal play but is really prevalent when spamming the triggers hanzo for example you fire by letting go then immediately pull back the trigger for the next arrow only to discover he isnt reacting to the pull until you let go and an arrow falls to the ground ive had some success with unplugging my keyboard and mouse and restarting the game seems to work best when i dont use my keyboard or mouse while the game is loaded
Overwatch,not_removed,quick update just solved the issue running overwatch through steam somehow fixes the problem entirely the issue is in how overwatch is processing controller inputs when keyboardmouse inputs occur during the same session loading overwatch with no keyboard or mouse use completely solves the problem suddenly it occurred to me that running the game through steam essentially letting steam handle the input overlay might make a difference and success nonsteam games can be run in steam by doing the following open up steam click games then add a nonsteam game to my library and choose overwatch overwatch will look like a steam game now get battlenet running and click play in steam to start the game so far i have had no issues when also using a keyboard and mouse to navigate menus and type in chat
Overwatch,not_removed,an additional update i also updated the firmware on my xbox one controller via usb via the xbox accessories app on windows at the same time it occurs to me that this may have instead solved the issue here is a technical explanation of the problem
Overwatch,not_removed,ive never had the option to reconnect
Overwatch,not_removed,this is a bug many people experience at the moment you just get randomly kicked and you re not able to rejoin
Overwatch,not_removed,so whatre we supposed to do take the loss
Overwatch,not_removed,two random players kept selecting and deselecting torbjorn before the match so to shut them up i also chose torbjorn
Overwatch,not_removed,i was wearing a green shirt with my green screen we had fun with it tonight too
Overwatch,not_removed,give bastions barrier back
Overwatch,not_removed,you were given the opportunity to leave and then you did not leave what did you expect
Overwatch,not_removed,given an opportunity i got news buddy even if you take that opportunity to leave you still got a loss and lose mmrrank
Overwatch,not_removed,wouldve lost rank either way point is if there are leavers you shouldnt be punished as harshly i dont think
Overwatch,not_removed,technically not true on and gengi you do not keep your ult if you die before dealing damage you only keep it if you die before the ult fully activates like if the animation doesnt finish if you hit q and just dont press the button down for example you dont get to hit q later same goes for reaper you only keep it if your animation doesnt finish with mcree you can fire at any time and still do some damage it just wont instantly kill them until its fully charged if theyre visible you shoot them if you dont fire before getting killed thats your fault unless you mean that you get shot before the animation finishes in which case hes not the only one dva has that problem not with the explosion but with calling the mech back if you kill winston or torbjorn though really hard to do while theyre angrily waving their arms as they ult they lose it too the reason his ult is so easily counterable is because if he pulls it off correctly he instantly kills the enemy theres no coming back from that for a lot of ults you can still survive or make a comeback but not with mcrees besides mcree gets most of his strength from his burst damage not his ult the other thing is that mcrees ult is like a channeled skill channeled skills can get interrupted and gengi on the other hand have whats more like a temporary boost reapers is just a activated skill and is different than any of those something should change though since soldier got buffed mcree is basically outmatched completely
Overwatch,not_removed,i remember reading that they changed it so that he lost his ult because a while back they felt that players were using his ult to shut down certain areas and force the other team to hide it was awhile ago so i could be mistaken
Overwatch,not_removed,it doesnt technically drain instantly you can press q and then get killed and still have like ult charge if someone kills you fast enough
Overwatch,not_removed,yeah i feel like he should change in some way also with mcree you cant fire at any time even if you click you can still get kills i forgot to mention that not only is there a second activate time there is a second activation time from when you actually click youre gun has to be pulled up to go off and this has gotten me killed many times those moments where frame makes all the difference causes me to die because of that gun pulling animation the one that starts just before you start shooting theres been countless times where ive clicked but died because of that small animation
Overwatch,not_removed,nope the moment you ult and die the whole charge is gone
Overwatch,not_removed,nope literally just saw it happen like minutes ago if you press q and then instantly die you will have some ult charge left
Overwatch,not_removed,it takes seconds to drain if you get hit immediately and i mean the moment you hit the button you can still retain some meter if killed
Overwatch,not_removed,lol nice
Overwatch,not_removed,with a blue winston in the background
Overwatch,not_removed,new skin leak confirmed
Overwatch,not_removed,actually only the damage increases not the splash radius afaik
Overwatch,not_removed,fairly sure he radius increases at least visually it seems to
Overwatch,not_removed,of course hes a bot hes playing zen
Overwatch,not_removed,i am hoping to raise awareness of this bot i run into it in and it just jumps and shoots either this is a bot or a very unaware human but i see it all the time and it does the exact same thing
Overwatch,not_removed,yes i have exactly him except when i played with him he was playing lucio sad to see hes still there ive queued with him times and asked everyone to report him guess it didnt work this was like weeks ago too
Overwatch,not_removed,i played against it in
Overwatch,not_removed,yeah i played with him twice last night he just stood in spawn as torb and kept hammering his turrent and crouch spamming i met him like weeks ago doing the same thing as zen lucio and made sure to report him but guess hes still not banned
Overwatch,not_removed,played with him a few nights ago with a friend he was torbjorn he just built his turret crouched and moved back and forward every so often we managed to win still but when we got him in the next game we just left
Overwatch,not_removed,exp farmers shame you lost his battle tag c shouldve reported
Overwatch,not_removed,i run into this acc almost every time i que up for lootboxes every game they euither just build torb turret in base continuously or something vague and useless to prevent being kicked the acc is obviously just trying to level by spamming games and i report it every single time i play with it but i just have a feeling blizz wont ban for trollinginactivity in unless the community makes a real fuss about it
Overwatch,not_removed,do people do this to get to level or is it just to get more lootboxes i dont really get it its not like you can farm rare crafting mats or make a ton of gold you sell for real money or do people sell mastergm accounts and need to bot them to comp level
Overwatch,not_removed,i dont believe the bots name was oneshot but i did run into either a bot or a troll in that was playing lucio and only jumping in spawn with occasionally shooting their primary weapon my other teammate then decided he would join the bottroll with jumping as he was trying to eat his nachos and didnt want to get distracted from playing left the game midway waited about a minute and then searched again only to have the bottroll on our team again doing the same exact thing
Overwatch,not_removed,there are quite a lot of bots in most are torbs tho guess with getting experience in custome games they will move there with the next patch
Overwatch,not_removed,very much a bot ran into him multiple times across many days doing the same thing
Overwatch,not_removed,ya i have no idea how it hasnt gotten banned yet
Overwatch,not_removed,i report it every time i see it
Overwatch,not_removed,thats kinda selfish there will always be those people on the planet deal with it
Overwatch,not_removed,yeah but we all payed for this game and we dont wanna spend our free time with toxic people i get where youre coming from though also this feature would be very useful for people who are being bullied or harassed by certain players reporting can take a while to have to be followed up on if its followed up on at all
Overwatch,not_removed,can you make a quick recording of this through the xbox dvr i want to see what you mean but cant play for a while my only idea is that i know on my elite controller i can change the settings from xy to radial idk what that actually does entirely but i think its related to it i think i may know what you mean though but i gotta see it to be honest if you could somehow compare it to another game clip that would be super awesome but just the circle in overwatch would be great too
Overwatch,not_removed,how much are you pushing on the joysticks in each video to max more over watch runs on dual zone aiming by default on console now that means that the aiming is slow when there is little input on the analog stick when the game determines you are trying to turn or look somewhere fast it switches zones and ramps up the speed of movement relative to input imagine a circles withing a circle with the smaller being about half the size of the first for visualization purposes only anything within the smaller circle will have a sensitivity of x and anything beyond that circles and withing the bigger circle essentially the rest of the available analog stick space will move at x y speed thats very simple and not entirely accurate but just to show the idea you can switch aiming to exponential ramp which is different from the dual zone whixh works how it sounds the game was released on console on exponential and when they implemented dual zone it became the default setting dual zone is good because over watch relies heavily on fast degree movements more so than cod imagine tracer blinking and turning to shoot genuine dashing and turning to shuriken zarya tracking a rein charge to bubble an ally behind her not sure why system cod is running havent played since black ops where my best game was wont ever fail to mention that haha but it could be that in your video and what you are experiencing is just you being between the two zones and getting varied feedback because of it
Overwatch,not_removed,yes the aim is a bit clunky on console you get used to it if it bothers you that much you can get a mouse and keyboard adapter for console if you want to be a cheating scumbag
Overwatch,not_removed,played with controller on diagonal movements seem fine the only thing i can really think of is that ow has less aim assist than cod titles which will overall make it feel clunkier which cod did you use on pc alternatively is it possible your controller is bust i frequently use an xbox controller on pc when im casual playing and diagonal aiming seems fine
Overwatch,not_removed,yes
Overwatch,not_removed,hey yeah let me give it a go i never used the xbox dvr so ill look it up
Overwatch,not_removed,i made the clip heres the overwatch clip httpimgurcomknqoexf you can see that it gets stuck or hangs at random spots and this is causing the circle to slowly but surely move around involuntarily this effect is very bad when looking up at the sky and trying to aim this is call of duty httpimgurcomplnxxwg i should clarify my original statement its not so much a perfect circle i mean it wont be perfect due to being a joystick but its more accurate and consistent meaning if i want to put the joystick somewhere it goes there with the same amount of movement in the same place this was very noticeable after playing hours and hours of black ops i would turn around and immediately place the crosshair dot on the persons head whereas in overwatch you can be sitting in the same place and turn around and try to place your crosshair right on the head and its not always consistent it has some weird acceleration or something to it
Overwatch,not_removed,hey thanks for the explanation so youre right it looks like ow is utilizing the different accelerations which i thought it was doing based on feel i put it on exponential a while ago because i found dual zone to be so inconsistent i never understood the meaning between the two but now it makes perfect sense i wonder why they went with that with cod i feel its more consistent with the dual zone stuff its almost impossible to turn around real quick and place your crosshair on the same point every time due to the weird acceleration and how itll depend on how fast youre moving it on cods mechanism it doesnt have as much variability which makes it actually easier to just turn the sensitivity way up and get used to that for aiming closer groupings as well as turning around so i take it theres no way to single zone the sensitivities or turn off any form of acceleration in the controller
Overwatch,not_removed,hahah im not a big fan of mouse and keyboard i mean im used to it kind of i use a lot of precision characters like mccree and soldier but there are times where im like i would have definitely got that if the controller setting wasnt so wonky
Overwatch,not_removed,check out the clips i made its very hard to describe but on pc with a standard xbox controller both and one was not the same as on console i tried different mappings but i think i remember reading that on pc when you use the calibration it calibrates the joystick as a square instead of a circle so when you go to the corners it gets all weird i actually found aim assist not to be bad on ow i played with it set to for a while just to see how it was and it wasnt too bad but the consistency was still there maybe people dont care about it so much or its not as noticeable because it seems a lot more people play on pc but its definitely irritating for me
Overwatch,not_removed,oh yeah dude this is pretty bad and i know what you are talking about ive experienced the same thing post this with the video examples in rowconsole they need to work on the aim in this game called you nailed down why the aim always felt so strange
Overwatch,not_removed,not sure if you can on console but it looks to me like call of dutys verticle y sensitivity is lower the horizontal sensitivity is higher maybe try adjusting that if you can try lowering the verticle sens then increase the overall sensitivity tell me how that goes
Overwatch,not_removed,yeah its tough to accomplish the thing with either aiming mechanic exponential still starts moving really fast but just is more gradual its like do you want gradual aiming sensitivity changes exponential or consistent sensitivity while aiming and consistently fast as hell turning dual they both arent perfect i tried both and i think i prefer dual just because i had gotten used to it at release i would go with whatever gets you the best aim and then practice the hell out of it for big turns and just get decent at it if possible i dont believe there is a fix all solution or a linear single zone mechanic you just have to work with one of these two and practice maybe work with sensitivity settings overwatch was built by a pc company so the aiming on console isnt the best and maybe we will see more improvements down the line i would be interested to know what works best for you and others just to see how other players respond to these options
Overwatch,not_removed,yeah it was driving me nuts ill post there hopefully they can tweak it up
Overwatch,not_removed,yeah now i understand why its happening but i wish they would let you just go with single zoneno acceleration option it certainly is possible with a mouse ive played a few games right now with dual zone and its not bad but its somewhat limiting in that by the nature of how it works you gotta be facing them somewhat to be in the soft zone and then if you want to turn around you hit the edge the problem is it makes it difficult to pull off very quick sudden kills like you see on ow pc or cod idk maybe im too used to the fast pace of cod but i want the ability to turn around and hit someone accurately within a split second theres wind up time from the moment to move the stick you gotta hit the edge to hit full speed cod or pc gameplay it starts moving as fast as you move from the center i see pc ow players pull of some neat stuff with widow and it might be possible on console if it allowed for quicker movement there were a lot of impressive and unbelievable accuracy players in cod using console that people thought wasnt possible just like here is on pc with ow there seems to be way more of a disadvantage to controller due to this ow please add an option to turn off all acceleration looks like there have been discussions about this already
Overwatch,not_removed,surprisingly few discussions i think the game and this sub seems heavily geared towards pc anyways yeah it sucks thats why everyone says pc is so much faster you coouulddd always just plug a mouse and keyboard into console at least for sure on xbox otherwise you have to get the game on pc
Overwatch,not_removed,so sad
Overwatch,not_removed,why do you reply to every new post with so x
Overwatch,not_removed,so stalky
Overwatch,not_removed,so true
Overwatch,not_removed,when they implemented this they said it was to reduce stress for players for people who hover around for example it would be a little stressful if losing a couple games would turn you into a silver player all of a sudden when in reality you may have just had a few bad games at the upper ranks though they insist you earn that rank and arent afraid to take it away i do think if you drop too far below your rank they should take it away though to more accurately reflect your skill at the present time also anybody who thinks their icon entitles them to any hero they like is a pompous dick
Overwatch,not_removed,if people are playing at say gold with their diamond badge then clearly they dont belong in diamond just ignore them if they are parading their badge around they either got lucky placements or were carried by people this isnt the fault of blizzard or the ranking system its the fault of the asshat players of which there are many in this game do the right thing right click block job done
Overwatch,not_removed,b u c k l e u p b u c k a r o o
Overwatch,not_removed,around average for na
Overwatch,not_removed,not too good not bad its a good place to start though keep improving good luck
Overwatch,not_removed,most pros are high mid and by pros i mean people who go out of their way to go to tournies
Overwatch,not_removed,thank you
Overwatch,not_removed,im and i just play this game for fun for now
Overwatch,not_removed,im and i take competitive a little too seriously
Overwatch,not_removed,im and i play a few times a week when my kids asleep
Overwatch,not_removed,they still deserve a penalty because they lost it shouldnt be a huge penalty mind you but not being punished for having an uncoordinated team is detrimental to the community
Overwatch,not_removed,if you are good enough to get golds and potg every game you will win of your games and climb easily
Overwatch,not_removed,i sincerely doubt youll have games where you get gold often if youre playing a healer and you have even one other person connected to the game odds are you wont do highest damage
Overwatch,not_removed,are you rank or what you shouldnt get golds
Overwatch,not_removed,stando powah your next line will be is this a jojo reference
Overwatch,not_removed,that would be interesting but what i thought the idea for doomfist if he ever got introduced would be that he would be a tank buster and have a powerful melee attack that does bonus damage to shields possibly just thinking we need a proper tank buster that isnt a tank itself not that im saying we already have a tanky tank buster but we need a proper tank buster but if heshe were to target mainly shields then that could disinclude rein and put diva back in again just thinking ps nice name p
Overwatch,not_removed,i would enjoy a tank buster i feel as though the tank buster should not be a pure dps i think the game needs more flex picks were a character serves multiple purposes i think that adds depth to the game unlike a bastion type tank buster who just a pure dps who is needed in the game but fees one dimensional
Overwatch,not_removed,perhaps a heavy attack of some kind that deals a shit ton of damage but cant be aimed and leaves you vulnerable whilst doing it so you can break down shields quickly but youll have to expose yourself whilst doing so and cant be aimed at heroes only shields because shields are the only thing big enough to hit with it
Overwatch,not_removed,
Overwatch,not_removed,mei will remember
Overwatch,not_removed,feed the gremlin
Overwatch,not_removed,its funny because of the time its the dva feeding
Overwatch,not_removed,i would have preferred doomfist a robot spider queen sounds like the stuff of nightmares
Overwatch,not_removed,jeff said that the robot we saw in a few pictures is not the next hero though
Overwatch,not_removed,this already virtually was confirmed
Overwatch,not_removed,pretty much
Overwatch,not_removed,because that was a female its interesting actually
Overwatch,not_removed,because that was actually a human with spider attachments
Overwatch,not_removed,yeah i would love some high visibility crosshairs like ones that are white inside with black outline to stand out against everything most of the current crosshairs that arent neon green or pink fade into something somewhere i wanna use blue but sky is blue wanna use yellow but all of temple of anubis
Overwatch,not_removed,they are needed god dammit
Overwatch,not_removed,what would you put on yours im a competitive player so i wouldnt want anything distracting lol
Overwatch,not_removed,more gap and mby get rid off drawoutlines and more thickness and less size
Overwatch,not_removed,basically same than mine in cs lul
Overwatch,not_removed,httpswwwchangeorgpblizzardentertainmentblizzardpleasechangewinstonsnametoharambe
Overwatch,not_removed,just stop get some help
Overwatch,not_removed,if blizzard doesnt do this theyre harambephobes and need to check their human privilege
Overwatch,not_removed,singing this right now
Overwatch,not_removed,someone finally takes a stand youre my hero
Overwatch,not_removed,stop
Overwatch,not_removed,never thought about having this an option id love to only be matched with players who have a mic
Overwatch,not_removed,mic users are actually the minority the better solution would be to improve on the existing ping and keyboard command system that way every single person can communicate language barriers wouldnt be a problem not having a mic not a problem either same with social anxiety etc its up to blizzard to make it easier to communicate in their game
Overwatch,not_removed,its like the of july
Overwatch,not_removed,d va finds and destroys my teleporter im able to quickly regain a new teleporter and deploy it after they kill teammates ultimately winning the round
Overwatch,not_removed,get away from my children
Overwatch,not_removed,unknown you say
Overwatch,not_removed,blizzard released an update to the matchmaking system earlier this afternoon basically youre in placements again
Overwatch,not_removed,thanks i didnt realize they had come out with a new patch
Overwatch,not_removed,why not when the last round ended i think everybody already knew the result before the final score show up
Overwatch,not_removed,classic bus throwing
Overwatch,not_removed,lol
Overwatch,not_removed,its coming next week with an update
Overwatch,not_removed,you dont want this you think you do but you dont try going on halo with everyone on the same team and try team killing each other aiming on console is impossible without aim assist and would no way help you
Overwatch,not_removed,just because it works for you doesnt mean it applies for everyone i met a guy who played with a track pad and could stop pubs
Overwatch,not_removed,actually the aim assist in overwatch is pretty bad on xbox anyway usually what happens is your crosshairs follow a tracer dashing by when youre trying to aim down a tight corridor its not like some aim assist where it lowers sensitivity when your crosshairs are on the target or snaps to the head its a weird thing hard to explain
Overwatch,not_removed,but you only could hear it but i guess that is not the biggest problem
Overwatch,not_removed,maybe when you ult it plays a few seconds of a selected track for everyone to hear
Overwatch,not_removed,arent you by definition being a cry baby right now
Overwatch,not_removed,soon theyll know i like winning and dislike losing
Overwatch,not_removed,there is no reward for doing so
Overwatch,not_removed,theres no i in team
Overwatch,not_removed,it doesnt matter
Overwatch,not_removed,then it doesnt matter if no one votes
Overwatch,not_removed,yes it does people only play for rewards
Overwatch,not_removed,had a hexakill with genji ult thanks to the enemy mercy also im aware of the crappy quality and choppiness obs has been recording like that and i have no idea how to fix it wanted to share but almost unwatchable if video editing pros wanna help out im game
Overwatch,not_removed,try to run on windows or mode might fix that
Overwatch,not_removed,think of this from your teams perspective if blizzard extend the reconnect timer they then have to wait longer for those people who dont come back to even have a chance at winning plus after several minutes of a game is almost definitely not recoverable im sorry i know i sound like a dick but if your net is that bad youre just hurting your team in competitive and maybe its not a good mode for you
Overwatch,not_removed,please blizzard i want to play competitive but the internet doesnt let me maybe you shouldnt play a competitive online game if you cant maintain a decent connection not your fault but not blizzards either you need specific material to play with specific conditions
Overwatch,not_removed,but at least the guy who disconnects can actually go back so now its a game of guy dcd for the whole match to guy dcd for a minute which imo is a lot better theres always still a chance to comeback
Overwatch,not_removed,no because after the minute timer the people on your team who got screwed over can leave without penalty to their rating you want to force them to wait even longer
Overwatch,not_removed,the rest of the
Overwatch,not_removed,sombra is stealing the bandwidth for her dial up modem
Overwatch,not_removed,ddos
Overwatch,not_removed,yes we need a explemation
Overwatch,not_removed,ddos attack right after we won first round of nepal
Overwatch,not_removed,somebody or more likely a group of people is attacking the blizzard servers with file packets that are lagging everybody to the point of disconnect this is because i have no idea what im talking about oh god please
Overwatch,not_removed,your submission has been deleted the reasons being your submission was already submitted in a very similar fashion and therefore counts as a duplicate if you have any questions please state them in an answer to this post for concerns or to contact the whole staff please with the removal of my submissionmessageim writing to you about the following submission issue is for more information please consult httpswwwredditcomroverwatchwikirules
Overwatch,not_removed,makes sense
Overwatch,not_removed,based on my experience with im gonna say about of people actually understand that synergy is the ticket and even less actually attempt to have it
Overwatch,not_removed,of people
Overwatch,not_removed,i had a friend today tell me he just found out overwatch is a team game and hes having a lot more fun now that he knows that he was complaining a lot when he unknowingly overextended and got ganged up on my other friends and i were just like how did you not know its a team oriented game not sure what percent but it seems crazy to me that a lot of people dont understand working as a team
Overwatch,not_removed,percent sounds about right ive gotten to the point where out of about online friends and my irl friends that play theres about total with whom ill play competitive
Overwatch,not_removed,know how to play but none of that knows how to use a mic
Overwatch,not_removed,lucky you haha ive got around the same amount of friends to play with but all of them are the type to main one hero and never change
Overwatch,not_removed,that just baffles me i mean i main supports but ive got a roadhog i work with if only to present options outside luciozenana i suppose i should just stop wasting my time in qp and pick widow first every time
Overwatch,not_removed,been doing that lately actually i used to be terrible with her but got three potgs in one evening recently
Overwatch,not_removed,couldnt it be abused by fucking with your internet every time youre about to lose
Overwatch,not_removed,problem with that is it still dooms the rest of your team to lose and take the full sr loss im still lobbying for a system that removes or at least halves sr loss for losing teams which had a leaver but still punishes the leaver with the full loss penalty will it be abused probably but id wager the amount of undeserved losses because someone droppedhad to leavegot angry far outweighs the amount of stacks where one guy is willing to take one for the team hell right now you dont even get a bonus if you manage to win
Overwatch,not_removed,i do like the idea and im sure theyd be able to have a detection system for crazy high ping but i dont think they should ask if you want to be removed since your connection might go back to normal one game i had a comp game and i dcd twice but after reconnecting the last time we ended up winning i didnt want to leave because i wanted to try all i could to help my team i heard some game has something that doesnt have your team lose rank if someone disconnects or something if the other side agrees maybe overwatch could get something similar since your team would lose sr if theyve lost and they might lose even more than
Overwatch,not_removed,bnet would look at connection stability not if it simply severs and dcs unless youre gonna ddos yourself
Overwatch,not_removed,i dont know how simple it is to use but theres something called a lag switch that basically cripples your internet whenever you want
Overwatch,not_removed,ah ive heard of these im not too well versed in the world of internet and all the possabilities but im sure theres something that could be done maybe fill out a support ticket and if you can prove you got dcd from connection issues theyll give back half of your lost sr
Overwatch,not_removed,since i got rated i never had someone talking in voice chat i have the feeling lower ranked players dont really care about winning or having an actual conversation i dont know if it true but i saw somewhere that when you play support heroes like lucio and mercy during your placement matches you get ranked lower than if you played more dpsbased heroes maybe thats why
Overwatch,not_removed,its actually a lot better than getting ranked way too high in hots i skyrocketed to rank which was really good the problem is i didnt really belong there after the placement matches i was constantly losing and my rank kept falling the worst part was when my teammates kept raging at me and telling me i belonged to lower ranks i knew they were right and it felt like i was just ruining my teammates games by being a mediocre support main so i quit ranked im glad im below in ow now i can actually enjoy playing
Overwatch,not_removed,i somewhat wish i had a lower ranking i won about out of am level or so and got a ranking of however this feels very very wrong not in a good way the people here compared to me are not even humans in the way the move and position themselves im slowing falling down in ranking about right now but man its annoying getting roflstomped almost every game by such better players especially when trying to grind for a gold gun tldr got ranked too high am getting shrekt by everyone and their mom
Overwatch,not_removed,i won of my placement games god awful teams using lucio for all of them and it put me as rank while my friend only won playing mei and he got rank
Overwatch,not_removed,ive played multiple games as and i can say that no more than one other person has used their mic
Overwatch,not_removed,this isnt really a bug per say but i wouldnt know what other forum to put it on i was considering getting a golden tracer gun as my next one but noticed that the flowers on her gun are a lot lower quality on the golden one for some reason regular golden i then looked at the other lunar new year skins and noticed that mercy has a golden weapon thats been altered for his skin as the flowers were already gold and were changed to a brown so that there wouldnt be gold on gold regular golden why didnt they do this for dva apart from that diallike thing being recolored she got a golden design added onto her pistol but it wasnt changed to another color when it was made golden which i dont get because this was changed for mercys skin which was an epic dvas was a legendary and unlike all of her other legendaries her guns were hardly changed apart from her pistol which was kinda ruined if you have gold gun for her which i do regular legendary i have no idea what happened with the tracer one or why an epic skin got more attention than an epic but i just wanted to point this out i dont think blizzard has ever updated any skins before but i would love if they did because if feels like there were details that got overlooked beep boop im not a miracle worker well not always i am robot my task in this subreddit is to transcribe the content of submitted forumposts from battlenet i also link responses of blizzard employees to rblizzwatch please message uxyooz if you have any questions suggestions or concerns httpsgithubcomnetworkjanitorpolarbytebot
Overwatch,not_removed,also should be noted that the light texture on the back of her gun is a lower resolution on tracers new skin but yeah the golden gun wth flowers looks so ugly
Overwatch,not_removed,needs more dicks out
Overwatch,not_removed,try getting a group of players with you that works best for me
Overwatch,not_removed,i always say if the problem is always your team its you i climbed to master solo no problem
Overwatch,not_removed,i have been easily able to rank up in solo q playig only supports basically
Overwatch,not_removed,i can assure you with enough games you will climb if you are good enough and have a positive or even neutral ingame attitude just give it time and try to get better
Overwatch,not_removed,hop in the subreddits discord and find some people to play with httpsdiscordappcominviteoverwatch
Overwatch,not_removed,i played zarya to climb from to and zarya only mostly because my team had a support played support if someone really preferred to tank instead and that helped a lot because in range a well played zarya will dominate the enemy team and youll just have to hope that your team is smart to play the objective at least a bit
Overwatch,not_removed,ah dude at least you climbed to i started at and now is hanging around i have resigned to the fact that i am in fact home at this sr level
Overwatch,not_removed,having a mic helps alot try lewding your team and start calling out enemy positiom everytime or find a group that can carry you but platbbronze
Overwatch,not_removed,this is just a copy of my comment from another post but i believe it applies to you and could help just for information i got placed rose to then dropped to this drop was a mixture of playing bad being tilted and being toxic i have since learned but i have now manage to climb back up to this was all done solo btw what i found best for me when trying to climb back up was playing flex although ive mainly played mccree and genji i will change to zarya or rein as you have probably read zarya is very good for carrying at lower sr use voice chat another common answer but i cant stress the importance of using voice comms in such a team based game like ow even if you just call out simple things genji top right dva mech down zen has ult will help a lot being supportive to team mates actually made a huge difference if someone isnt performing well dont berate them try to encourage them having a positive outlook on the game can make a difference even little comments like nice shield zarya great pick road are good i think this next one was the biggest factor take a break i will take a min break every games even if i won all those game relax watch a stream grab some food whatever but i felt personally that this made a huge difference to my game play i would come back feeling fresh and ready here is my overbuff for whatever reason
Overwatch,not_removed,i know that its easy to conclude i belong there and am not as good as i think i am but i assure you thats not the case actually its exactly the case
Overwatch,not_removed,you can have golden medals but it also depends how fast you get kills i am but sometimes i matched with teams and i am happy cause its super easy to carry
Overwatch,not_removed,that would definitely be ideal but i have no clue how to find a team my roommate and girlfriend play but neither of them are that great lol
Overwatch,not_removed,its not always my team its just my team often enough to keep me low ranked what do you suggest
Overwatch,not_removed,try lewding your team or not theyre gonna be too focused on him lewding them to play
Overwatch,not_removed,lol i know that feeling try the lfg reddit or just addingmessaging people you meet in game ☺️
Overwatch,not_removed,not sure what platform you play on but httpswwwredditcomroverwatchlft has requests from all types looking for teamates also httpwwwoverwatchteamupcom and httpoverwatchlfcom good luck out there
Overwatch,not_removed,its easy to think the teams you get are holding you back but its not the case youre in a team with randoms who might be worse better or even at the average rating eventually the real skill of your team should equal the rating youre the sixth person a whooping of your team you can skew the skill of your team by being better than your skillrating your opponents will be people who average around their skillrating some will be worse some will be better and some will be as skilled as their rating but the same goes for your team as an example lets imagine your teammates are at rating average and their rating and actual skill is ratingskill player player player player player they average in rating as do their skill roughly you your teams average including you rating is but your average skill is your opponents are player player player player player player their teams average rating is and their average skill is you have an average skill of which is just above theirs its a very minimal edge and you need a lot of games to climb as most games arent up for you to decide most other games are or less where you are of your team which gives you a greater impact overwatch is a slower climb if youre not a lot above your skillrating in terms of skill sorry for the long post just needed to write this out as this is a response i write quite often from now on ill just copy paste this if i made any errors it might be because im very tired feel free to let me know and ill edit when im more awake if theres any interest for a smaller guide on how to climb let me know edit might as well add this theres other factors than just skill a few of them are flexibility attitude and communication
Overwatch,not_removed,i mean you were only gold not like you were high ranked to begin with and now you get to look like a god while playing bronze players
Overwatch,not_removed,theres a bug when starting games which blizzard knows about and has been looking into since oasis went up on the ptr
Overwatch,not_removed,were continuing to investigate errors starting games this is one of the main reasons why they have the ptr to catch gamebreaking issues before the patch gets pushed to the live servers
Overwatch,not_removed,im pretty sure they tested it just fine you can hack a torb turret by using emp or by doing so when its already firing at someone else in other words you need to coordinate with your team
Overwatch,not_removed,quality shitpost
Overwatch,not_removed,as soon as you start playing the guitar on the mtv
Overwatch,not_removed,im grandmaster never heard of this i didnt get rewarded
Overwatch,not_removed,this isnt league of legends where diamond is decent
Overwatch,not_removed,eh its late why not right
Overwatch,not_removed,finally someone got the title
Overwatch,not_removed,if you didnt know about this then why even rank up so high why do anything if the end result does result in bjs and money
Overwatch,not_removed,im grandmaster humblebrag nah im joking but your rank is inferior to my grandgrandmaster rank
Overwatch,not_removed,so wait are you saying i wont have women fighting over me to bask over my diamond glorious ass
Overwatch,not_removed,not with that attitude
Overwatch,not_removed,i had to add iti feared that the reference would be missed and that would make me sad thats the way you do it
Overwatch,not_removed,because my life is sad tho i could appreciate a bj or two
Overwatch,not_removed,na its just to show how sad my life is
Overwatch,not_removed,well if one in ten ow players is diamond we would run out of women wouldnt we
Overwatch,not_removed,lemme tell ya them guys aint dumb
Overwatch,not_removed,being a high rank in a video game is not the worst thing you could be doing with your life
Overwatch,not_removed,good idea could be a great way to practice a character outside of the limits of the objective id like to get the hang of more projectile characters but qp usually just involves playing a choke and playing bots doesnt cut it
Overwatch,not_removed,iirc this has been posted before but there would be no need for skirmish to become an arcade mode with lord jeff talking about having a lobby system for custom games so people could join a skirmish lobby and have changes to health etc to make the deathmatch even more interesting
Overwatch,not_removed,good point completely forgot about the server browser
Overwatch,not_removed,i love that mercy spray i put it on everything my recent favorite is giving illidan angel wings
Overwatch,not_removed,do you even lift bro
Overwatch,not_removed,this one is pretty much the most hilarious spray combo weve come up with and i still laugh when i see it
Overwatch,not_removed,gg ibnida fly away
Overwatch,not_removed,would have been nice with a chat bubble like thanks
Overwatch,not_removed,that looks awesome
Overwatch,not_removed,dva right besides you nerf the heroes that never die
Overwatch,not_removed,dont let your eyes deceive you shes actually spike from the gremlins
Overwatch,not_removed,pretty much describes how it feels when these two play well together
Overwatch,not_removed,now that was fucking beautiful
Overwatch,not_removed,i honestly feel like that should be added to the side of dvas mech
Overwatch,not_removed,i love spray combos get are some of my favorite widows scope spray plus any head but especially healers ana zzz spray plus any head well played and other hearthstone emotes plus any head
Overwatch,not_removed,i use that spray more then franks red hot sauce
Overwatch,not_removed,a child of light and darkness
Overwatch,not_removed,you pigs in human clothing
Overwatch,not_removed,mercy looks so pissed
Overwatch,not_removed,dakingindanorf
Overwatch,not_removed,damn son i put that shit on everything
Overwatch,not_removed,temeeeeeeeeee
Overwatch,not_removed,just who the hell do you think i am

Overwatch,not_removed,the first thing i thought when i clicked the new shirts was this is blatant sexism and i am a white guy who is generally oblivious to that kind of stuff because it does not affect me every female hero icon in femaleonly sizes
Overwatch,not_removed,please use the hotsoni skin lfg thread on the sidebar in the important box
Overwatch,not_removed,ok sorry didnt notice that
Overwatch,not_removed,theres nothing worse than failing to run away from mei but now theres this
Overwatch,not_removed,amp it up amp it up amp it up why didnt you amp it up
Overwatch,not_removed,i love her follow through she jumped off the ledge to finish freezing that lucio
Overwatch,not_removed,should have amped it up you could have got out of range quicker
Overwatch,not_removed,im a bot bleep bloop someone has linked to this thread from another place on reddit footerif you follow any of the above links please respect the rules of reddit and dont vote in the other threads rtotesmessenger messagecomposetortotesmessenger bot
Overwatch,not_removed,her frost beam needs a range reduction
Overwatch,not_removed,receive ye deserved karma
Overwatch,not_removed,she got you something it was the sweet release of death
Overwatch,not_removed,itll be a cold day in hell
Overwatch,not_removed,thats possibly the cruelest method of execution ive seen used by mei yet
Overwatch,not_removed,freeze dont move
Overwatch,not_removed,is it sick of me that i really want to see the kill cam
Overwatch,not_removed,backwards wallriding boop you mei have been screwed either way however
Overwatch,not_removed,goodbye satan its been nice hope youll find youre paradise tried to see things from your point of view hope your killings will all come true
Overwatch,not_removed,its not for nothing we call her satan xd
Overwatch,not_removed,ikr haha i feel like this should be a category in uifaptomccree s list if it isnt already
Overwatch,not_removed,i realized that after i was half frozen
Overwatch,not_removed,that wasnt her it was the other lucio
Overwatch,not_removed,still wouldnt be fast enough i think i thought i could make it
Overwatch,not_removed,roverwatchcirclejerk low effort shitposts bitching about low effort shitposts
Overwatch,not_removed,hook should be nerfed its a bit too much of a hard counter to movement outside of reins shield area meis blaster should have a range reduction it makes it a bit hard to move away while on that note anas sleep dart is a bit too strong you should be able to walk around while asleep waiting for more than seconds to do anything is a bit much goddamnit why dont we take out all of the cc in this game and just be cod
Overwatch,not_removed,im fine with that if sym and zaryas beams are reduced as well in fact every beam needs about a of it reduced
Overwatch,not_removed,i agree that it should be maybe a meter shorter
Overwatch,not_removed,there arent even any sombras
Overwatch,not_removed,÷yokgtfukf÷
Overwatch,not_removed,every time im in danger i naturally speed up and spam the amp it up button even if i used it seconds ago this both gets me killed and saves me alot
Overwatch,not_removed,why tho
Overwatch,not_removed,yeah these are all ridiculous you know whats also crazy a lucio cant outrun a mei with speed boost also the other skills you listed have cool downs funny post regardless of truth edit holy shit autocorrect on my phone
Overwatch,not_removed,i think zarya is fine with her range as it has no added effects like symmetra and mei do
Overwatch,not_removed,herp derp i thought you had other lists pertaining to each hero my bad carry on lol
Overwatch,not_removed,did zenyatta bsodd
Overwatch,not_removed,maybe he wanted to get a boop kill but mei killed me first so his dreams were shattered he fell to his death
Overwatch,not_removed,qp
Overwatch,not_removed,he cant outrun mei if hes already been tagged by her blaster given lucios great movement abilities he shouldnt really be in position to get caught by meis abilities unless he fucks up a wallride or something gets cornered or gets caught by surprise my comment was in jest but i see too many comments like above in games with cc involved to not poke fun some game devs even take feedback like that to heart and you end up with stuns being changed to roots sleeps being turned to slows etc eventually you end up with this watered down concept of cc in the game which was initially the drawing factor for players like myself whove come from dota or other games that otherwise wouldnt have picked up an fps however i do have a bias as i enjoy playing cc heavy heroes like mei quite a bit so ill happily stand corrected if you have any disagreements clip was funny as fuck tho think we can both agree on that edit also shitty phone auto correct
Overwatch,not_removed,i think that meis gun shouldnt slow down your turning
Overwatch,not_removed,
Overwatch,not_removed,naw i knew it was to be funny no real disagreements here her main attack fits well with her kit cheers
Overwatch,not_removed,
Overwatch,not_removed,translation is death death death death is whimsical today life is more than a series of ones and zeroesy if anyone was wondering
Overwatch,not_removed,d that sneaky bastard
Overwatch,not_removed,very cool
Overwatch,not_removed,always a fan of great pixel art good job d
Overwatch,not_removed,hey hey be careful with that torch
Overwatch,not_removed,make them out of wool then watch them burn
Overwatch,not_removed,thanks its a nice way to relax after a long losing streak
Overwatch,not_removed,it wont happen but it would be funny if the skin would play crazy frog when you put the speed boost on
Overwatch,not_removed,but i dont have a mic
Overwatch,not_removed,but i dont like being screamed at by micromanaging arm chair generals
Overwatch,not_removed,and thats ok at least youll still be able to hear call outs
Overwatch,not_removed,no keep the competitive to so we can focus on the core of the game keeping the game balanced for is hard enough no need to throw competitive into the mix balancing both of these at once would be impossible
Overwatch,not_removed,i think this could be doable if we have a second separate ruleset for balancing the game for both and at the same time will never happen so just branching into a separate ruleset is easier i dont think the devs will want to spend the effort making separate abilities etc for but they could tweak the numbers on the characters a bit to make some of them moreless viable in i dont think it would be too hard but im also not the one who has to do the work
Overwatch,not_removed,
Overwatch,not_removed,
Overwatch,not_removed,i think this was a csgo subreddit
Overwatch,not_removed,development stuff maybe lore and leaks all speculation
Overwatch,not_removed,overwatch is also the name of military forces in half life games so maybe something related to that
Overwatch,not_removed,lots of speculation
Overwatch,not_removed,this guy knows whats up
Overwatch,not_removed,makes more sense my knowledge of csgo is limited to it exists and you shoot people so my mind went to hl instead
Overwatch,not_removed,what skin you rockin there boopbro

Overwatch,not_removed,yeah none of that applies to this post
Overwatch,not_removed,holy carp thats awesome
Overwatch,not_removed,thanks messed up posting this as i somehow didnt make the thumbnail appear doing this on my ipad
Overwatch,not_removed,ill sign that hanzo approves
Overwatch,not_removed,how long does it take to get comp points great job
Overwatch,not_removed,it takes awhile considering i have around but it mostly depends on your winrate and how much you play
Overwatch,not_removed,ive had this happen several times ive found that it only happens when you boot the game and queue immediately when you boot the game you will see the grey login screen for a while none of your character unlocks can be seen as well as your profile icon just wait tab out for a little while for the game to load all of the assets wait until you have a hero in he main menu then go queue for a game hope that helped
Overwatch,not_removed,try contacting blizzard support maybe they can help you with this
Overwatch,not_removed,i think its your computer system slowing down which made you cant load the game just like you cant open many others game together it will open real slow
Overwatch,not_removed,i had a similar issue where i found a game but after waiting seconds nothing happened thinking it was a bug i could search for a second game it found and as soon as the second game was over i lost mmr for the first game if that makes sense lol
Overwatch,not_removed,a friend of mine got stuck and he restarted the game if you didnt do that and this happens again try that
Overwatch,not_removed,i would try out training modepractice until you get into a map with your character model once you load in once you will load in to all other games
Overwatch,not_removed,i had the same issue during placements but they didnt count as a loss ive also had issues loading models and textures and in these games the exit and exit to desktop buttons didnt work not sure if its related but ive also had issues with bnet updater it hangs up and wont update i believe its actually trying to verify my game is up to date and not actually installing a patch but i havent verified this i believe there is a correlation with the issues because last time models wouldnt load i exited and tried to do the scan and repair thing then tried to reinstall and they both failed
Overwatch,not_removed,this has happened to me on xbox as well so it cant just be you its really quite frustrating
Overwatch,not_removed,i had this issue when using skype at the same time as overwatch no other voip program has caused issues
Overwatch,not_removed,i was able to load into a quickplay immediately afterwards and i just built this computer so i dont think thats it
Overwatch,not_removed,i think its more of a network issue
Overwatch,not_removed,what about your sister
Overwatch,not_removed,dont get the consoles not because im a hater but because you will regret doing it now the and the upgraded xone whatever its called are gonna be released soon enough nontheless id go for a pc anyway aiming with a controler is not too pleasant imo
Overwatch,not_removed,depends are you looking to play more casually or do you want to get into competitive potentially consoles wont be able to maintain the same level of competitiveness that pc overwatch will have if youre okay with that then sure the cheaper price of a should definitely draw you in besides that the pc version will be more populated in the coming years

Overwatch,not_removed,can i just give the code away lol i dont need it or is that against the rules
Overwatch,not_removed,can give it away just dont post the code here as bots will claim it
Overwatch,not_removed,were do i post then im confused it my first time really using the site sorry
Overwatch,not_removed,may i suggest rgiftofgames
Overwatch,not_removed,you can just pmprivate message a person the code and bots cant grab it then good luck
Overwatch,not_removed,you get the left over time from the round you were on offense to try and beat their points at least thats how i understand it
Overwatch,not_removed,oh okay i vaguely remember hearing something like that but wait then i still dont understand the overtime business if our time was up because of last round why even give us the opportunity to play out an ot isnt that just a waste of time
Overwatch,not_removed,unless ive missed something huge and car engines are now controlled purely by electronics they shouldnt stop an emp wont stop the pistons moving when fuel is mechanically injected into it super dont have time to write it perfectly edit forgot that ow was in the future
Overwatch,not_removed,i dont think they run on gas bastion does not need fuel or dvas mech
Overwatch,not_removed,fuck i just realised this was ow and everything was floaty and awesome yeah those trippy hover cars should probably get shut down silly me being too modern p
Overwatch,not_removed,but then again sombras hack does not affect bastion tank mode
Overwatch,not_removed,but does affect roadhogs mechanical scrap gun ultimate and his ability to throw a hook sombras ult doesnt make the most sense
Overwatch,not_removed,and even his ability to drink apparently
Overwatch,not_removed,also bricks mccrees knees
Overwatch,not_removed,no its qp let the hero stacking im in for an unranked mode with comp rule but i want my hero stacking
Overwatch,not_removed,hero stacking is pretty frustrating but only if you try to fight it lol idk how to explain this let me try tho heres how i survive soloq qp if the lobby looks soooo bad eg all squishies no healers and i dont feel up to it i can leave asap no real penalty there unlike competitive this happens about of the time so half the time i just take up healing and be ready to lose another half i quit so the frequency of having to leave game is not that much that it would affect me if my team starts stacking you can a stack with them and enjoy the mayhem b again leave or c play whatever hero you want to practice the mechanics or whatever if enemy starts stacking i can a get my team to stack counters against them all torbs go all mei all dva go all reaper idk the real good counters just saying counters are there then mayhem ensues or b play a solid composition and challenge the cheese or c again leave i usually do a or b depending on what my team decides to do i believe a lot of fun can be experienced through the hero stacking mechanics allowed in qp for overwatch and that makes the game awesome the issue is when people try to get a good game in qp ie reasonable composition no stacking presumably in order to practice for competitive then you will be frustrated when hero stacking happens my tip to survive soloq enjoy the stackingcounterstacking consider it an only slightly better option than practicing against training bots and have fun if blizzard can make the normal mode casual but no stacking i think it would fill up this gap for people wanting to practice for competitive
Overwatch,not_removed,but why
Overwatch,not_removed,zero pressure fun play what you want and when you want to if at any time you dont like how its playing then leave comp doesnt offer that comp rules with no ranking doesnt offer that quick play does there should be a place with no ranking that has no hero stacking quick play is not that place i understand qp isnt for everyone but there are people with hundred plus hours in the game who have never even touched comp those people dont need to have thier favorite game mode taken from them
Overwatch,not_removed,its qp made for fun and non serious games
Overwatch,not_removed,because of dwarf fortress full torbjorns
Overwatch,not_removed,fun meis pick only one
Overwatch,not_removed,but its not fun for the people whose time is being ruined by having to fight six hanzos
Overwatch,not_removed,its fun
Overwatch,not_removed,then leave or just play something you like why ruin everyones fun for a few peoples that think playing seriously in qp is useful
Overwatch,not_removed,why do people think wanting to play without hero stacking means you have to play seriously take any other class based game and do it its annoying even if its easily countered its annoying deal with think of playing against a team of pyros i dont play mobas but a team of all the same hero there are so many selections theres no reason to pick or more of the same hero other than to troll

Overwatch,not_removed,so far for me itd be the comics the wiki and theory vids on youtube httpscomicplayoverwatchcomenusreinhardtdragonslayer
Overwatch,not_removed,try the wiki httpoverwatchwikiacomwikioverwatchwiki it has the backstory to just about everything in the game
Overwatch,not_removed,lol
Overwatch,not_removed,how can i make blizzard aware of my feedback post in the blizz forum where they actually read stuff
Overwatch,not_removed,theyre not ever going to split queues theyve already told us exactly what they were going to do in regards to the matchmaker behind the scenes were going to be making another change to our matchmaking that deserves its own discussion the simple and primary goal of our matchmaker is creating fair matches to do that it evaluates potential matches by synthesizing an expected win the matchmaker is normally really good about creating matches with a win that is close to but if the participants in the match are either at very high or very low srs then it gets quite a bit more difficult there simply arent many players at the extremes of sr to find this is especially true in our lower population regions and theyre playing at off peak times such as in the morning and the players queue in a large group normally in these situations we wait to try and find a good match but eventually compromises have to be made so the players in question dont wait forever in queue well were not going to compromise as much anymore the matchmaker will no longer create a match above a certain win percentage threshold and were going to turn this new behavior on very soon when we do you could possibly wait a very long time or even not find a match at all in extreme cases to find fair matches quickly try to play during prime hours for your region it also easier to match you if youre solo or in a smaller group in a future patch when we think we cant find a match based on the current matchmaking population then well warn you that the wait might be a very long time we didnt want to overreact and create a strict rule such as you cant queue as a group above x skill rating there are some locations and times that can handle high skill groups and still find fair matches for them well start with this new threshold not being very aggressive but we can adjust dynamically if needed when we do add the ui well also make the check more aggressive
Overwatch,not_removed,i find that my matches tend to go better with premades more people will attempt to coordinate when in a group
Overwatch,not_removed,this doesnt actually reffer to splitting the queues it is the main system that we have as of now but its a system they can apply in a more moderate measure to easen up queue times to the alledgely two new queues thank you for your linking read it when it was posted and thought it was a very good idea but cant see exactly how it fits in the frame of a possible i would say plausible queues future especially with ov being such a rapidly changing new game
Overwatch,not_removed,blizzard have already made it clear that a solo queue would be more or less the case of last resort when literally everything else failed they were quite clear about this its not going to happen to implement a solo queue would be admitting that one of the core design goals to create an inclusive game with players making new friendships and playing together completely failed
Overwatch,not_removed,i personally suggest spending some time with every character even if you dont play with them on a regular basis some time with the character gives you an understanding of what to expect and what the characters can do im generally the though on the team so i might be biased
Overwatch,not_removed,honestly do whatever you enjoy its a game if you enjoy only playing reinhardt then continue doing that
Overwatch,not_removed,imo learn other tanks zarya and dva come to mind your teammap awareness skills should transfer over making it easier to learn more characters also the players that can specialize tank dps support etc are focusing their time on learning similar characters and skills and thus improving at faster rates than the players attempting to learn zarya mccree lucio widowmaker and tracer at the same time you dont need perfect aim like you would with a mccree or soldier but you need exceptional positioning and awareness on the battlefield furthermore tanks are always good in higher level play two tanks are almost always mandatory and no ones ever going to flame you for playing dva or zarya at the moment barring corner cases like you already have tanks and no support or something and your team is mean diversify by all means and see if you enjoy other characters but if the primary focus is to improve as fast as possible specialize in a role also playing reinhardt so often means people probably love playing with you haha on almost literally every map i ask can we get a rein please because hes just so dang useful
Overwatch,not_removed,that is insane are you trying to keep it all even like that or is it just by chance
Overwatch,not_removed,i think thats why im so hesitant to play as anyone else because i feel like im good enough as rein and people always love to have one around i was forced to play as while defending anubis and had kills and deaths so that was really satisfying lol
Overwatch,not_removed,it didnt start out that way but the last week or so i have been purposely trying to even a few people out i doubt itll stay that way forever
Overwatch,not_removed,i feel the same during the open beta i logged maybe hours as roadhog and felt the most impactfulcomfortable as an offtank but now i mostly play mccreereapermercylucio my opinion is that in the end if youre having fun and youre being a team player being friendly trying your absolute hardest being flexible then youre golden
Overwatch,not_removed,farts i was excited to see what people would say
Overwatch,not_removed,stop caring about winning as much and enjoy the game
Overwatch,not_removed,this is the kind of player that deserves to be banned
Overwatch,not_removed,u rotten person

Overwatch,not_removed,that was great kind of a spidermanpharah feel
Overwatch,not_removed,in the oh so elequant words of friend watching this video with me ooooooooohhhhhhhh shit
Overwatch,not_removed,nice my shit just hits the wall and comes back never lets me escape
Overwatch,not_removed,yes it literally is you got hooked so you got pulled to where you were hooked from youre lucky you dashed or you wouldve been dead instantly rather than seconds later
Overwatch,not_removed,we are number on except roadhog hook is now a dash reset
Overwatch,not_removed,torrrrrbjörn reaaady to fight

Overwatch,not_removed,there is rwitchmercyporn
Overwatch,not_removed,ctf if youre playing properly will reward you a minimum of exp for a minute draw game it takes exp to get a new level thus loot box that means youre more or less guaranteed a loot box after games in the worst case scenario no other game mode gives such a reliable source of exp ctf games can be over in under minutes with the winning team getting exp for their win depending on how they contributed making it so that the last team that captures the flag wins would actually increase the number of draws as players would go out of their way to intercept you before you ever got close to their base
Overwatch,not_removed,the entire point of doing those games is to get a loot box therefore the important part is the loot box not what it takes to get there you can easily complete games in minutes httpsyoutubegpbkxkppehe theyre rewards for success not rewards for participation
Overwatch,not_removed,i have no idea what youre going on about in regards to downvoting and if someone else downvoted you only you can see that until x minutes after your post which is what im assuming happened deleting your thread is just cowardly
Overwatch,not_removed,there has already been a lot of discussion about this
Overwatch,not_removed,you should get all your potential cards and should be able to choose which one you put forward
Overwatch,not_removed,this is a game by blizzard to be fair lol
Overwatch,not_removed,given a statistically relevant sample size of games good players will win more often and thus climb the ladder you dont see seagull at rank do you and bad players will lose and thus drop sure there are games in which case you play like a god but your team sucks yadda yadda yadda and you end up going feelsbadman but the thing is thats not statistically relevant chances are if you play above your skill level your skill level will rise to meet your actual skill furthermore how can how you played possibly be completely accurate as an indication of skill gold medals dont mean anything they just stare that your teammates were more incompetent in certain areas than you were gold eliminations at wow incredible what a hero using medals or stats doesnt account for all the times your winston went back line and kept the widowmaker from mowing down your team and escaping before any kills could be made nor does is account for all the times mercylucio had proper positioning and kept your team grouped and alive etc in the end your win rate is the only accurate and unbiased way to judge how good you are cloud and envyus arent two of the best teams in the world because all they do is lose games left and right
Overwatch,not_removed,didnt readcry harder your just bad
Overwatch,not_removed,seagull is very good no doubt about it one of the best in the world that does not however mean that blizzards system is perfect just because someone skilled can do well with hanzo doesnt mean hanzos good or well balanced just because someone can reach a high rank doesnt make the system perfect or excuse it from its failings these streamers are very good undoubtedly but they also have their pick of the litter when it comes to choosing groups to play with if they like they dont have to do solo queue and anyone including the best players would be happy to group with them id be interested to see seagull or some of the other streamers do an experiment start at level and play only solo queue for a week or two no doubt theyd climb but theres no way in hell they wouldnt be frustrated by some of the issues listed in my op along the way stylosa made a video on basically this very thing actually and his video was essentially an apology as he didnt get it before when he only played at high rank with a strong group you said youre win rate is the only accurate and unbiased way to judge how good you are its really a measure of how good your sequence of teams is this will include you and statistically youll climb if youre good but that doesnt mean the losses are going to be your fault or that youre in control of your rating i think its frustrating to watch other players run your skill rating into the ground regardless of if it evens in the long run nobody sits ingame and thinks well in the long run it wont matter because statistics they think god d it my ratings gonna go down now because this junkrats not in voice chat and keeps running running into the middle of the enemy on his own or god d it our team mate disconnected my skill ratings gonna go down the problem is that you dont have very much control over your personal skill rating and you should have total control over your personal skill rating its just a bad idea and a bad fit for a team based game like ow in general as there are too many problems with your true responsibility for that rating say i group up with others and go up ranks in a few hours how responsible for that was i what if seagull was a regular on my team how responsible am i really for going up those ranks am i responsible for the loss i receive when someone on my team disconnects am i responsible for the loss i receive when offensive bastion and torbjorn throw themselves at the enemy or when team mates demonstrate incompetence no im not yet my skill number reflects that you said how can how you played possibly be completely accurate as an indication of skill to be blunt i think thats a very silly point i think its fairly obvious whether you or someone else did well and contributed or whether you or someone else didnt pull your weight or made mistakes when we watch seagull its clear that he does well and contributes its obvious sure there are a lot of factors involved but i can tell when i didnt pull my weight and i think most can how you play is exactly what individual skill should reflect though i think thats something of a difficult undertaking and i dont think its a good fit for this title for the aforementioned reasons i think there are far better systems they could adopt to replace the one they have now
Overwatch,not_removed,yup thats it im just bad thank you for clearing that up for me i feel better now i think pretty sure all the real and present issues i listed were just my imagination thank you for clearing up my delusion you jack ass go fuck yourself or wait i know you could offer counter arguments instead of an assumption based on the air since you didnt even read the post
Overwatch,not_removed,i guess it depends on the situation if nobody will go support i wont hesitate to pick up mercy who i dont use often and if people arent happy then they can take over the support role otherwise ill admit that ill use rounds where there are leavers on the other team to experiment with a new hero started picking up widowmaker because of it dont use her often but still it was a nice teaching round when we were already pretty much guaranteed the win anyway but in general yes i agree with you
Overwatch,not_removed,but in that case you are better off saying hey im not good with support characters can someone else heal nbsp personally i would rather someone say that than to lock onto say lucio and provide mediocre heals in silence that way i could take over
Overwatch,not_removed,youd be amazed how many times i tried that just i dont play support often but i can try if nobody else will and how many times i ended up as the support for the round lucio who i had a whole minutes experience in quick play at that point was my pick and now hes my second mostused comp character because of that luckily i already overcame my misconception by then so i could try to be useful i thought that you had to shoot your allies to heal them with the healing song while the arrow sped you up because it was the attack mode to his gun got taught that that was wrong after about one quick play round of thinking that
Overwatch,not_removed,if your teammates are so against playing support that they will let someone with little support time fill the role then i think there are bigger problems to worry about nbsp that being said knowing that comp play requires different teams for different situations why wouldnt you dedicate a few quick play games to learn a support character an important staple to every great team beforehhand
Overwatch,not_removed,because i was used to filling the other hole that so many people would leave open tank and i thought having a tank was more important than having a support and besides lucio isnt exactly the most difficult hero to use wellenoughtogetthroughagame didnt take too long for me to feel semiconfident with him
Overwatch,not_removed,if you own an nvidia video card you could probably use shadowplay
Overwatch,not_removed,obs shadowplay fraps and others will record video
Overwatch,not_removed,obs is the problem think i need better graphics card raedeon heard of fraps tho will check it out to bad playstv wont do what i tell it to
Overwatch,not_removed,fraps is just a recorder it isnt as efficient as the newer programs
Overwatch,not_removed,had an overwatch lan this past weekend and of us played for a good hours straight put this together the following day came out pretty nice
Overwatch,not_removed,httpsusbattlenetsupportenarticleoverwatchsystemrequirements according to blizzard you need at least a intelcore but i personaly would buy myself a core to fit the recomended requirements the other parts should be fine
Overwatch,not_removed,a solid entrylevel gaming rig overwatch at fps at on high should be achievable but frankly the difference between medium and high in this game is minimal so dont be afraid to turn things down a bit to wring a better framerate out of it about more would bump you up to a overwatch wont really care but other games might worth considering also consider picking up a cheap hdd for data storage that ssd is going to fill up fast
Overwatch,not_removed,a stable fps on high ehhhhhhhhh i kinda doubt it it will run the game just not on high
Overwatch,not_removed,lowered graphics should get you on that setup you for sure wont be able to run at on the highest settings the is quite a low entry level gpu and the dual core processor will just throttle any card above it i reckon medhigh graphics should get you but you may see drops in large team fights
Overwatch,not_removed,dont know if you are aware but the gtx has a higher benchmark as well as the
Overwatch,not_removed,meh an is only just barely better than the and most of the advantages it has are things overwatch doesnt really care about
Overwatch,not_removed,no one got to see your thank you c
Overwatch,not_removed,id assume its because you threw the trap down after the mine went off
Overwatch,not_removed,seems buggy i got mine after the second time i thought i did it dont remember if the trap killed our not either time ana definitely took sleeping quite a few ulters to pop
Overwatch,not_removed,yep thats exactly this the achievement is using the mine to throw the enemy into the trap not arming the trap where the enemy will land

Overwatch,not_removed,absolutely disgusting
Overwatch,not_removed,you used scatter arrowthats more than arrow
Overwatch,not_removed,im on eu
Overwatch,not_removed,ptr is set in american servers by default and cannot be changed which is why your ping is probably higher than usual
Overwatch,not_removed,sigh every time people write this the whole point of my post is that for the entire time ptr was live my ping was the same as it is on client however now in the past two days it is much worse
Overwatch,not_removed,i guess blizz changed some servers around with the legion launch
Overwatch,not_removed,o derp sorry i didnt read the past days part
Overwatch,not_removed,sharpshooter didnt expect junkrat to get that
Overwatch,not_removed,i cant believe how boring overwatch gets in offseason glad season is here
Overwatch,not_removed,if you have leaves in that short a time you should probably consider not playing competitive until that becomes more stable
Overwatch,not_removed,there will always be problems with balancing leaver penality because there are people who will ragequit by choice and people who will aciddently leave the game because of other reasons its nearly impossible to balance out perfectly but lets see it like that even if you leave by accident youre still part of the reason your team loses the game if people who have bad connections just keep leaving games over and over even if it is in fact by accident whats the difference between them and people who keep leaving on purpose it doesnt help your team that you didnt mean to leave they will lose and get frustrated because theyre playing a whether you didnt mean to leave or not wont matter as much
Overwatch,not_removed,leaves over the span of the month long season shouldnt lead to a competitive ban in a week maybe however leaver penalties prior to being banned needs to be more harsh a loss isnt good enough especially when you leaving pretty much guarantees the rest of your team will be sharing your penalty leaving should also lock you out of competitive for a short amount of time which should help in deterring those who intentionally leave as opposed to those who dc
Overwatch,not_removed,i got knocked out of a quickplay match because a vacuum cleaner tripped the surge protector my router tv and xbox are plugged in to and nights ago bad storms with winds strong enough to flicker the lights reset my connection a few times id hate to be banned for that
Overwatch,not_removed,my guess is its on some kind of cooldown timer kind of like csgo if you leave a game before the cooldown timer reset your penalty increases if you keep leaving before your cooldown resets eventually it will lead to a full ban so it is probably ok to leave games once in awhile and not worry about a long term penalty
Overwatch,not_removed,if your powerinternet is that unstable or your computer crashes etc then why are you in comp shouldnt you stick to quick play until you are fairly certain everything is alright
Overwatch,not_removed,if you are experiencing internet issues constantly and not time accidents why play something that affects everyone yeah lagers i am talking to you you would be amazed to how many players play console games on a wifi connection that is based a mile away from the console with poor internet speeds i get it that not all ppl can afford good internet but i applaud those that understand that with their connection cant play games that affect other people progress as well i dont play the game i love the most on its competitive mode due to the latency issue i have because the servers are based on different continent and my hardware setup is plain normal i have small delay due to all that its not lag but a late response in my side from receiving playing information i understand that i am in a deficit so i chose not to play that competitive mode for the sake of my self and teamates thank god overwatch works perfectly due to servers all over the world thanks blizzard
Overwatch,not_removed,i feel like that if you play with a smaller team due to leaver there needs to be a reduction to the amount of rank you lose
Overwatch,not_removed,base it off a of games played after a min games played something like a min of games and a quit over will get you banned for the season if you cant manage to finish at least you deserve to be shut down for a little
Overwatch,not_removed,ya i think they should make it similar to cs have dc timer in which the dcd player would have x amount of time to reconnect maybe min if they miss that window of time they get a loss against their account if they dc more than times a season they should be banned for the remaining of said season or maybe after games if their dc is too high they get pushed out of competitive until they improve their dc in quick play
Overwatch,not_removed,there should be a heavier penalty but im not sure how severe it should be of my placement matches had dcer that didnt come back dcer came back id complain less but of them were not in my favor so im salty it isnt fair for the people that have to go through this because of people with poor internet im really wondering as quickplay i almost never had people dc at the start of the match
Overwatch,not_removed,i personally dont see it as an issue if its leaves within say a day if your power knocks out or the internet goes shit games of competetive obviously you should not be going into those modes i respectfully disagree because if you join a competetive match you should expect to be able to fufill it every time of course anyone can have an accident but eg not times in one day though i do think the solution should be less of a ban maybe just a weeks lack of access to competetive
Overwatch,not_removed,i kind of lowkey love when someone on my team leaves a certain loss in ranked because yeah its marked as a loss but i dont lose rank so towards the end im kind of hoping for it lol
Overwatch,not_removed,the type of ban youre referring to im sure that even blizzard can be appealed to but you know if after the fourth game your computer shuts down again it calls for reflexion
Overwatch,not_removed,if you are having issues with power outages and crashes just dont play competitive until you get that stuff resolved if you are having connection issues stick to regular play you still get to play the game and your disconnections wont matter too much
Overwatch,not_removed,i got kicked from a match as bastion when the other team all left except i got kicked for afk because there was nothing to shoot and i alt tabbed to browse reddit
Overwatch,not_removed,well some people think there is no greater evil than to leave a game and whoever does it regardless of the reason must be expelled from society pretty sure most of them would reconsider if it happened to them
Overwatch,not_removed,no matter the reason for leaving you are fucking your team over and should be banned if you dont have a stable enough connection you shouldnt be playing competitive not sorry
Overwatch,not_removed,in my opinion the punishment should become more harder leaving games per day without trying to reconnect to the game should ban you for the rest of the day someday you get a bad connection or something other shitty happens but then ill ask why are you trying to play if you get disconnected every half hour you loose and your teammates too i think if you are too stupid to understand this blizzard should tell you that today its better not to play competitive try tomorrow and all the ragequitters should go to hell someday you win and someday you loose if you are so upsad loosing a game you better should play quickplay or tetris
Overwatch,not_removed,playing a match last night and my ping shot up to over usually at thankfully it didnt dc me and stabled out i wonder if i get ddos at times because it happens during a match and i have my router settings set to give most all of the internet to my computer but then again it could just be time warner fuck them with their shitty speeds
Overwatch,not_removed,if you leave the game intentional or not should be punished that being said it should not be punished by perma banning that person for the entire season because thats way too overkill also if you want to avoid rage quitters find a team of to play with your rank wont even be a legit rank anyways since anyone who plays solo could easily be much lower or even much higher in rank that what it shows them to be
Overwatch,not_removed,i had some major driver issues on my pc and ive had to reinstall windows i was crashing times a game but thankfully i could log back in to the match before my session timed out glad i havent started competitive play yet
Overwatch,not_removed,i got dcd because my room hit my tower i got back into the game and we won counted as a loss feels bad man
Overwatch,not_removed,maybe a csgo cooldown type system should be implemented first leave is a minutes ban then an hour then hours etc if blizzard wanted the final stage could be a season ban i agree that jumping to a season ban so soon is a little extreme
Overwatch,not_removed,if something like this is implemented it cant be a static number of leaves should be a percentage of games played say of the last or games this makes it fair for people who play several hours a day like me and to be honest i havent seen leaves as much of a problem so far ive played around games and dced randomly once myself and had a rage quit on the enemy team once as well thats only of games being a problem
Overwatch,not_removed,its not an absurd rule at all its a month ban from competitive that seems completely appropriate for leaving games dont play competitive if you have shitty internet hell sometimes my internet cuts out randomly if that happens to me in games in one season i completely understand getting a ranked ban for the rest of the season plus the max ban time is months but that assume you played games on day one and left every single one if thats the case then yea man get out of ranked
Overwatch,not_removed,i got the penalty warning the other night after i spent minutes trying to play through a single full match in quick play during which time i had all of the following kicked for inactivity seconds into the loading screen for a brand new match frozen games which required me to force quit match where i couldnt see the opposing team but they could kill me about matches in a row which reset due to lack of players or reinstancing lag was so bad players would jump about metres per step and i could shoot at someone and have no damage register for about seconds all it turns out because there was a mass ddos going on the other evening
Overwatch,not_removed,true mainly factors like how much time is being played vs how many disconnects are happening and also how often they return and how soon should all be factors like leaving for seconds here and there isnt going to necessarily cost games but leaving and not returning a few times a week is bullshit and those players shouldnt be in competitive they need a better setup equipment or situation before being ready to play competitive and not ruin other peoples gaming experience every time they leave and dont return realistically you shouldnt really have disconnection problems most of the time if you do then you have to think about the fact that every time you leave and dont come back or cant stay connected thats people who are effected if this happens times a week thats people who are losing games because of you i dont think thats ok and should go without penalty maybe not a season ban but at least a week ban would be in order actually leaves should be a hour ban just to give people a heads up in the event they somehow dont realize what they are doing is wrong if they persist twice more in a day period after the hour ban they are banned for a month and if they do it again even once in the days that follow that month ban they are banned the rest of the season what little is left at that point in quick play it doesnt matter it effects games but at least new people can pop in and even turn the tides of a battle in competitive it straight up ruins games thats just my opinion but i have had a situation where i couldnt stay connected and i chose not to play competitive its just not right until you figure out how to get your setup working properly it makes it so you cant ever really be at your skill level anyways since its always going to be skewed from all the losses you are taking from games you would have won so why bother you ruin the experience for yourself too
Overwatch,not_removed,im working with a shitty card due to my last one frying and an older machine that keeps crashing due to memory leaks thats currently keeping me from playing competitive because im afraid that ill be ruining the experience for everyone else in the match as well as ruining my chances so with leaves only thats kind of rough to be honest they need to enforce it but unsure how
Overwatch,not_removed,some thoughts on this i havent gotten into competitive yet since im on xbox one once it comes to console id like to give it a try as a new dad though im not sure that i really can from what i can tell from other threads around here the main problem is that leavers hurt their teams its like a red card in a soccer match makes sense to me instead of marking leavers why not punish them by putting the loss penalties for the entire team on the leaver if a baby starts crying midmatch then im sorry teammates but im gone right now they get a loss on their record either way instead why not mark me with five losses one for each teammate and mark them with a no decision or something else neutral no reason for them to get hit because i have priorities and for something like that id gladly take those losses something else that i think blizzard should look into is a way to shorten comp matches it seems like they can currently run an hour or more and that seems a bit excessive competitive should be for serious players but shouldnt be offlimits for folks who have lives outside of games
Overwatch,not_removed,i cannot agree with this more i live in western pa so it is not rare for the power to go out often during the winter while this isnt an issue now in months that would mean i would be done with this game because of a shitty rule a bunch of pissed off redditers begged for
Overwatch,not_removed,some of you guys are taking this seriously to a point where youre coming up with irrational shit to say if youre that frustrated with leavers and people who have poor internet connection perhaps you should find some friends through overwatch who meet your requirements and play ranked with them
Overwatch,not_removed,hitting the leave game button and being dcd are two completely different catagories if people intentionally leave games then fuck them if they dc or have connection issues thats a little bit better maybe leaves before season ban
Overwatch,not_removed,i would say if it happens routinely enough once or twice a day for three days in a row yeah theres something up going on there times spread out through out a month thats fine
Overwatch,not_removed,the tough part here is balancing people who inconvenience other players rage quitters andor folks with bad internet connections while acknowledging shit happens i think the answer is simple you have free disconnects for whatever reason on the fifth you sit out the rest of the season the number of disconnects you have available is hidden so people dont say well it says i have available so fuck these guys im quitting however you are forgiven a disconnect every weeks you go without a disconnect so if i have a weird week with a thunderstorm fuse blown little brother turning the game off whatever in a couple of weeks im in good standing again
Overwatch,not_removed,maybe they should pause the game while the slot is filled
Overwatch,not_removed,if you cant buy a decent computer for you shouldnt play we live in a decent internet connection costs around euro per monthif you cant afford it dont play it isnt where a good internet access was a miracle adapt to the modern times or dont play competitive mode you can easily play a quick match
Overwatch,not_removed,it sucks for ranked when you are playing then you disconnect because of weird reasoneven if you manage to reconnect and finish the game and winyou still lose pointsfucking stupid blizz logic right there
Overwatch,not_removed,im sure theres a way to find out if someone pressed escape and left through the interface or really lost connection so id still advocate for the ban and if the internet disconnects regularly or the pc crashes quite often im sorry but youre probably not able to play the competitive mode it sucks for the individul player but it ruins the fun for other people in each game it happens so id set the bar very low for people leaving through the interface and it would set it a little higher for those with shaky connections but not too high either
Overwatch,not_removed,the only people im picturing saying something like that are children like cartman in the wow episode who has his mom bringing him food and poopsocks so he can keep playing uninterrupted forever
Overwatch,not_removed,thats retarded that means you arent aloud to leave a game once every week and half to weeks otherwise you are fucked
Overwatch,not_removed,games in months doesnt seem that much to me
Overwatch,not_removed,say a player manages to play games a day but he cuts out games within a month due to internetpc issues youre telling me he should be banned for the entire season for disconnecting from five matches thats literally less than of his matches if that player were to at least play a day this summer i understand that its frustrating for a player on your team to disconnect but why should this player be banned from an entire season i have yet to have any disconnection issues aside from a server crash on day its ridiculous to remove an active player for an entire season when he disconnects at that frequency matches out of
Overwatch,not_removed,rage quitters dont try to rejoin the game right now though blizzard punishes people for dcing and rejoining which is kind of a problem in promoting people to rejoin after a dc and finish the game
Overwatch,not_removed,unfortunately the ragequiters fall into the leavers category clearly their issues should be in a separate category on its own
Overwatch,not_removed,people who will ragequit by choice youd think itd be hard to tell the difference between the game client lost a connection to the server and some guy hitting esc and clicking on leave game
Overwatch,not_removed,thats their purpose instead let them keep a leave per games ratio to determine who should be banned for example a ratio this high will flash out of the competitive mode rage quitters and ppl with bad internet those that accidentally leave a game due to disconnect will have nothing to fear since accidents dont happen frequently
Overwatch,not_removed,get a upcapc theyre like surge protectors with batteries in them have to get one with enough juice to power everything plugged into it but theyre great for those situations
Overwatch,not_removed,i dont think you should be playing if you know your connection is unstable or could go down at any moment
Overwatch,not_removed,lol why dont you just have some new outlets and a battery unit installed in case of an electricity cutout this is competitive you should be giving it all you got in all aspects of life git gud scrub s edit not a topic for sarcasm eh i stand by my shitpost its shitty but its mine
Overwatch,not_removed,no i paid for it
Overwatch,not_removed,i agree if you have a shitty connection i sympathize i had one for years as well but if you play a team game with a chronically unstable connection your attitude basically boils down to fuck yours got mine so dont be surprised if the game fucks you right back
Overwatch,not_removed,when i was playing quickplay for the past week u had no issues and never lagged once once competitive came out my first game it seems like i always lag out no clue what has changed besides the game mode i dont have the issue with any other games either
Overwatch,not_removed,i dislike the idea of a static number of games before punishment someone with little time could play games rage from them all and get no punishment while a prolific player could play games get dc times from random chance and be punished
Overwatch,not_removed,we do it min
Overwatch,not_removed,you singlehandedly undermined the whole argument times a day and you will only get weeks suspended thats ridiculous i agree with games a season they you are suspended for the season there are no excuses not to finish your ranked game power goes out fine times in months is till insanely high my power has gone out times on the past years you should have at least a half hour to commit to your ranked game
Overwatch,not_removed,what makes you think thats an unpopular opinion
Overwatch,not_removed,reconsider what its an entirely different story when it happens to them for some reason dummies will be dumb
Overwatch,not_removed,well to be fair if you know the power will go out very often its not that wise to play comp anyway since youll cost your team the game very often
Overwatch,not_removed,wyoming here see ya competitive but srs blizzard pls no
Overwatch,not_removed,if people intentionally leave games then fuck them how do you from a server standpoint tell apart someone who ragequits and someone who has a technical problem unplugging ones internet router is undistinguishable from a legit unwanted disconnection
Overwatch,not_removed,wow people have pretty low standards i think times in a month is way too many times to be leaving a game and not returning right away if you leave for seconds and come right back yeah that sucks but thats one thing leave and just dont return times in days literally once every three days maybe you need to upgrade some things or simply are not able to play competitive cause thats ruining a lot of peoples games thats literally people who are playing a and probably taking losses because your equipment or setup or situation sucks
Overwatch,not_removed,soooooo many people with shitty hardwareinternet are getting so sad on this thread if your internet sucks dont play competitive its the same as saying i play to win but if your internet is constantly dropping are you really playing to win
Overwatch,not_removed,im sure theres a way to find out if someone pressed escape and left through the interface or really lost connection nope you could always pull off the cable or turn off the wifi
Overwatch,not_removed,so dont leave games
Overwatch,not_removed,so give people a grace period after a dq to rejoin those who dont rejoin get banned after x games left and those who do arent penalized although thats probably what everyone and their brother is preaching to blizzard so its nothing new
Overwatch,not_removed,they should but how exactly would you be able to make an algorithm to detect rageleavers that cannot be guessed by those very same people and thus be exploited truth though is a rage leaver and someone who shouldnt be going into competetive with unstable connections do end up causing the same issue intentions or not
Overwatch,not_removed,sadly there are multiple ways of losing connection on purpose
Overwatch,not_removed,pull out your router shut down the pc kill overwatch taks there are enough ways to fake a dc
Overwatch,not_removed,its not like you could pull your lan cable deactivate wlan pulling out your router turning of your switch turning of your pc will make you lose conetion on purposeof course you can detect closing game and losing conection but it can be faked soooo easy
Overwatch,not_removed,says you people with really shitty internet connections even though they should stay out of ranked but hey democracy right play ranked sometimes on the other hand i dont really mind if those get banned from competetive either way even though unintentionally those people should be reminded that if they drop out of a teamgame they should stick with quicksearch
Overwatch,not_removed,arent they really designed so that you can just shut things down properly and not really supposed to be a lasting power supply the ones that youre thinking of are really expensive
Overwatch,not_removed,why is your post at reddit is weird
Overwatch,not_removed,i realise that youve been sarcastic but that made you sound like yo boy with mumphs
Overwatch,not_removed,one of my friends would constantly disconnect in lol due to his bad internet and a number of times it was a free loss for the team as much as it would hurt him i hated duoing with him for this reason leaves is a little harsh to be punished for a whole season through especially with the state that the ranked afk system is in assuming it gets fixed in sure theres a better number to go with
Overwatch,not_removed,probably better to base it on a of total games lets say if they dc during more than of the games they play
Overwatch,not_removed,yeah but isnt it broken right now dont you still get marked for a loss if you dc and return in that minute i expected season to be a mess but i wasnt expecting stuff like this to be a problem
Overwatch,not_removed,sorry for sounding stupid but how do we rejoin a match yesterday i got afk kicked when going for a piss right as we won the first round couldnt figure out how to get back unless afk kicks dont let you rejoin
Overwatch,not_removed,i personally disagree i dont think you at all will need that heavy punishments you need to inconvinience people so much that rage quitting will feel worse than not doing so in months isnt high at all just because your personal experience says so this heavily depends on where you live
Overwatch,not_removed,but its a freak thing i paid for this game like everyone else im not gonna avoid playing this game anytime theres a chance of rain i think youre dicking paying customers more by saying you cant play this mode more than youre screwing a team over due to the fact that its just one game maybe have a system similar to halo where theyll ban you for a few hours from multiplayer if you leave too much but the whole season is od
Overwatch,not_removed,if it registers that somebody clicked the leave game option in the escape menu and then hit yes or continue to the second set of security for leaving games rather than just dropping connection
Overwatch,not_removed,assuming youre playing four games a day and your math checked out then thats every game people on your team are playing a full game i wouldnt be that annoyed if it happened every once and awhile
Overwatch,not_removed,from a console experience times a month getting disconnects it definitely smells like internet issues on pc i would suspect the hardware maybe cant handle the play stress and shuts down maybe this means that their hardware needs an upgrade if they want to play competitive as for the internet good luck identifying what the issue is and if it is fixable
Overwatch,not_removed,it would at least ban those that were unaware or didnt care to take that much effort not everything has to be a perfect solution every little helps
Overwatch,not_removed,sure theres always a way to exploit but that takes some kind of effort im talking about people who deliberately leave and leaving through the interface is for sure recognizeable
Overwatch,not_removed,some people need to walk away for and they are kicked life games not sure maybe not
Overwatch,not_removed,they should be in a position that are able to understand i cant play this game because i have slow internet but they dont they play the game with a hope that a miracle will happen and their connection will get better on its own and is always the servers fault that they cant accommodate them properly i say let them play and if their connection does not meet pre set standards kick them out of that mode so at the end only good connections will remain
Overwatch,not_removed,depends cheap ones are about and look like large surge protectors i have a large one on my entertainment center worth it just for my to prevent a power blip from corrupting the hard drive the two stats is how much power can it put out at once and for how long i have an old version of this apc backups pro uninterruptible power supply ups that one can power watts of stuff offhand i think my can draw up to w led hd tv is about w and under load it can actually keep it all up for about minutes i shutdown after thirty it has a display that shows power consumption so its easy to figure out what each device draws to ensure it doesnt get overloaded besides being a battery backup they also smooth out power fluctuations like brown outs and surges
Overwatch,not_removed,i think there was another reply saying it in a sarcastic way i dunno i have apcs on all my electronics power goes out and i keep on playing for about half an hour
Overwatch,not_removed,was that the point though
Overwatch,not_removed,my work here is done
Overwatch,not_removed,from what ive gathered you get a loss for a dc but if reconnect within a minute you get no dc on your record for dc penalties
Overwatch,not_removed,some people argue it is intended i dont know
Overwatch,not_removed,for me your play button in game menu should become rejoin
Overwatch,not_removed,not sure if its a difference between lol and ow or just a function of time but the zeitgeist of this sub is definitely oriented toward competitive purity
Overwatch,not_removed,its because league players are shitty teenagers who are running off of their parents mbps internet
Overwatch,not_removed,yes you can add that stuff to the client and then people with just reboot their router or unplug their ethernet cable whenever then want to ragequit without being detected as such
Overwatch,not_removed,so youre saying youre cool with three thunderstorms in one season knocking out your power ending your competitive play season
Overwatch,not_removed,if you dont have a dedicated amount of time to spend then dont play competitive simple as that
Overwatch,not_removed,yeah the one i have will run my desktop for about minutes so anytime the power cuts off and right back on i can keep playing it would power normal computers for about minutes but my computer uses close to watts at load
Overwatch,not_removed,your score is back up reddit fixed itself aha i was so baffled you would be down voted for giving good advice i have an apc for my stuff too and its a godsend
Overwatch,not_removed,the point the reason and the goal disclaimer i stand with op isp and power providers fuckups shouldnt ever influence peoples ban in online gaming this ist another case of the many bearing the few in order for things to work out eventualy
Overwatch,not_removed,yup and i know that but there should be something more than nothing
Overwatch,not_removed,you clearly didnt read i just said ban those who voluntarily leave games by pressing the leave game button
Overwatch,not_removed,oh i didnt know life was so simple
Overwatch,not_removed,you did not say that you said ban those that were unaware if im unaware that im leaving then im not clicking the leave button
Overwatch,not_removed,unaware that theres a penalty for voluntarily leaving dont know how you read it any other way based on context or didnt care to take that much effort implies active quitting
Overwatch,not_removed,i played games yesterday from which i won i was placed in and im now in among the games i had only one game where i really didnt do any good i dont have any possible explanation how this system works and what they actually measure all i know is that in the current system theres no way for me as a solo player to recover the placement rank competitive will just be a quick play with hopefully a little better matchmaking it wasnt yesterday but maybe down the road when it settled a bit most of the time one team got extremely shattered ill just try to get points to buy a weapon and wont give a damn about the ranking anymore because its hopeless in the current state
Overwatch,not_removed,was just about to post something like this myself i went in games and lost points all my losses lost me basically an entire bar between numbers while my wins gained me less than of a bar granted some games i had low impact rounds but others i carried my team is this poor implementation how is performance being measured
Overwatch,not_removed,from what i gather the basic components to how much you earn are you expected to beat the other team aka what is the total skill difference in the game winning or losing personal performance in game
Overwatch,not_removed,you win it goes up you lose it goes down on payload maps its full gainloss on point cap maps its only of payload gainloss anything you do in game has no bearing on the end result the only thing that matters is you win
Overwatch,not_removed,thats why u network on a fucking team game
Overwatch,not_removed,if this is true blizz needs to implement a system where you can choose what kind of games you play i could go in games all wins being cap and lose one payload map and go down thats absolutely ridiculous
Overwatch,not_removed,also remember that because it is so early comp mode it takes time for players to settle in their actual mmr the pros should probably be at but they are only at right now the shitters are probably at or at the lowest so far right now there are just too many variables that we cant account for only once everything is settled can we take a serious look a the math
Overwatch,not_removed,yup i did three nepal games with good teams and didnt even go up a rank then got stuck with four torbs genji attack on a payload and ended up losing a rank from one game i had heals gold objective kills bronze and on the objective gold as lucio why the fuck am i being punished because they refused to work together
Overwatch,not_removed,almost as if you shot his arm off name reference
Overwatch,not_removed,monster
Overwatch,not_removed,oh it might actually be my friend shooting the ball i wonder if that rainbowdash was in party with somepony
Overwatch,not_removed,support main voice toxic dps
Overwatch,not_removed,god damn it barb
Overwatch,not_removed,how did he make it to diamond if he trolls every game
Overwatch,not_removed,he was placed there hes lost around points since then season placements overrated a lot of players
Overwatch,not_removed,but he cant be losing that much or hed drop like a rock and thats the problem with avoid player limited to your own team people will avoid anyone they think isnt pulling their weight or is playing the wrong heroes
Overwatch,not_removed,symmetra winrate widow winrate only two heros he plays in comp hes a known troll in this range i just wish you could report someone for trolling and have them get put in a low prio queue like dota
Overwatch,not_removed,then hes not going to stay in that sr range very long if hes actually griefing or refusing to play report for that playing widowmaker is not something that blizzard will or should punish people for
Overwatch,not_removed,stop trying to intentionally misconstrue my comment just to be obtuse the fact that this guy keeps losing and making this game worse for everyone isnt justified by the fact that hes going to keep dropping its only passing down the problem to others and there is no option to report for trolling or griefing and all bans are automated anyways blizzard only chat bans based off reports for harassment in overwatch there is no other punishment as of yet
Overwatch,not_removed,im not being obtuse im pointing out the absurdity of what youre asking for the only thing in your post that could justify a ban is deliberately placing teleporters facing off cliffs which i just noticed because you buried it you should report players who do things like that and follow up with blizzard support if you want them to look into it other than that youre literally asking blizzard to ban this guy because you think hes not playing well andor not playing the way you want him to if he wants to play nothing but widowmaker and symmetra and hes not good enough to win consistently at his current rank hell drop until his win rate stabilizes thats literally what the ranking system is for
Overwatch,not_removed,the only thing in your post that could justify a ban is deliberately placing teleporters facing off cliffs which i just noticed because you buried it not trying to be obtuse just happens to ignore until now a ban worthy offense according to him sure man you should report players who do things like that and follow up with blizzard support if you want them to look into it there is no such report option for griefing or trolling only chat bans are given out and they are completely automated blizzard support does not ban people if he wants to play nothing but widowmaker and symmetra and hes not good enough to win consistently at his current rank hell drop until his win rate stabilizes you really are trying to be obtuse his winrate is stable hes been doing this since release the problem isnt that hes just supposedly bad the problem is that hes intentionally ruining the game for others if placing troll teleporters and picking awful heros with the intention to feed isnt enough evidence for you then theres only one thing i can say you are being obtuse
Overwatch,not_removed,gtsure man i skimmed his post initially because it seemed like the typical my teammates arent doing what i want ban them complaint he actually took the trouble to split his post into paragraphs and then buried the lead the mention of deliberately placing trap teleporters is at the end of a paragraph so i only saw it when i read his reply and then went back and read his post in more detail yeesh if hes only winning at a rate then his win rate is not stable and hell constantly be losing sr if hes winning at a rate then he cant be that bad and youre exaggerating his behavior picking the wrong heroes is not intentionally ruining the game as long as the player is actually trying to play and win ive listened to people bitch about the same thing for five years in league of legends with players who main unusual or unviable champs in ranked play people end up at a ranking where they can win of the time regardless of how well or poorly or unusually they play if he is intentionally running into the enemies and dying or never attacking the enemy team then report him for that refusing to play what your teammates want you to is never going to be bannable even in comp the ranking system puts players where they belong in the long run blizzard will not and should not use bans to solve disagreements about team composition or ingame strategy
Overwatch,not_removed,i skimmed his post initially he actually took the trouble to split his post into paragraphs and then buried the lead the mention of deliberately placing trap teleporters is at the end of a paragraph jesus christ how egotistical are you how hard is it to just admit you were wrong if hes only winning at a rate then his win rate is not stable stable not likely to fall or give way as a structure support foundation etc firm steady able or likely to continue or last firmly established enduring or permanent a stable government resistant to sudden change or deterioration a stable economy is the aim of every government steadfast not wavering or changeable as in character or purpose dependable positive stable you can have a stable sub winrate picking the wrong heroes is not intentionally ruining the game as long as the player is actually trying to play and win then why do you keep dodging the issue that this person isnt trying to win you keep bringing up troll teleporters and then you completely forget about it as you proceed to white knight this guy blindly if he is intentionally running into the enemies and dying or never attacking the enemy team then report him for that i believe this is the third time ill be telling you that there is no such report option for this and blizzard does not ban for this the ranking system puts players where they belong in the long run blizzard will not and should not use bans to solve disagreements about team composition or ingame strategy i see whats going on here youve projected yourself onto a person youve never met and now youre blindly defending him in direct opposition to your own supposed rubric for bannable behavior o b t u s e b t u s e
Overwatch,not_removed,oh ffs i originally missed the part where the op said the player placed a teleporter facing off a cliff i acknowledged that already but if it makes you feel better i will admit it again attention i am admitting that i initially misread part of the op a player cant both have a win rate and stay at the same sr if he has a win rate he cant be a longterm problem hell drop and drop and drop and drop until hes not playing with other tryhards anymore if hes holding a win rate at diamond then he cant be consistently trollingnot trying to win because otherwiseeven teams at those ranks dont have anywhere near a chance of winning a so which is it you never said that this player is not trying to win other than one throwaway comment about badly placed symmetra teleporters let me say this again so that maybe youll listen if someone is deliberately sabotaging their team or refusing to try to win they are griefing and blizzard should ban them but not switching off of widowmaker or playing attack symmetra are not griefing if the player is still trying to win and if avoid player was put back in the vast majority of the time it would be used against players who were judged to be playing badly not legitimate griefers and when you report someone there is a place where you can type in details about why you are reporting them or you can report the player directly to blizzard support i find it hard to believe they would not take action against a player getting a large number of legitimate reports of griefing but thats a separate issue if theyre not an avoid player system might help with this but would cause an unacceptable amount of collateral damage
Overwatch,not_removed,if he has a win rate he cant be a longterm problem if he keeps playing competitive he is he just will negatively affect other people hell drop and drop and drop and drop until hes not playing with other tryhards anymore what do you mean by this just because people are bad doesnt mean they arent trying their best its a competitive mode the point is to try your best if hes holding a win rate at diamond then he cant be consistently trollingnot trying to win except he isnt ive told you a million times hes dropped over points how dense are you you never said that this player is not trying to win that is known for trolling and feeding makes troll teleporters for his teammates again how dense are you if someone is deliberately sabotaging their team or refusing to try to win they are griefing and blizzard should ban them thats my point you dense manape blizzard should ban them however blizzard does not ban people for this there isnt even an option to report for griefing you subhuman mongoloid i find it hard to believe they would not take action against a player getting a large number of legitimate reports of griefing opinions are like assholes everybodys got them unfortunately yours is extra useless there has been no reported case of a griefer being banned so far in this game
Overwatch,not_removed,sorry for the potato quality but i had to do a double take during this game
Overwatch,not_removed,as a support your death is influenced more by your teammates than by you
Overwatch,not_removed,id like to see how many people i saved from critical
Overwatch,not_removed,as a support i beg to differ i never exceed about deaths as support regardless of my team mates why and how i stay alive is on me
Overwatch,not_removed,this would also be nice i think
Overwatch,not_removed,if they have a winston focusing you as anyone other than zen then no amount of player skill will be able to stop you from being murdered repeatedly killing him once or twice maybe but even with perfect play hell kill you faster than you can kill him it takes your team helping for that to stop
Overwatch,not_removed,understandable if you play lucio or zenyatta but ana and mercy are completely dependent on their teammates assuming the anas actually being useful and not camping far back trying to be a sniper
Overwatch,not_removed,zen is great in the sense that he can dish out serious damage but that said he has zero escape cds is frickin slow and has no way to heal himself if i have to say run away from a dva mccree etc ult unless i have a lucio or rein to save my ass i have a decent chance of being toast it is a similar story when flankers dive on you i can often survive a but the moment it becomes im pretty screwed
Overwatch,not_removed,theres a post on the overwatch tech support forums with some basic things to try and some programs that are known to cause problems id suggest starting there
Overwatch,not_removed,gotta kaaaaaaaaaap the point
Overwatch,not_removed,boop
Overwatch,not_removed,but did you win
Overwatch,not_removed,thanks for including all as
Overwatch,not_removed,yeah we did other team came back but never got on the point lmao
Overwatch,not_removed,i counted
Overwatch,not_removed,do you kill people more than you die good do you die more than times per point bad
Overwatch,not_removed,yeah so below ive seen that a lot of players throw hard or generally dont care about winning this makes it very difficult for players who actually want to try and play well so i can understand where you are coming from to answer your question i would say that its not really possible to determine how much impact you have as as a player in that placement due to the amount of people who dont even try to win i think what you need to try and do is get out of silver and into gold gold is better not great but better for games but i know its no easy feat each new season im placed around points lower than my season high from the previous season this means having to deal with numerous games in low platinum high gold that have many leavers toxic players etc but each time i get back to rating theres no secret to this other than playing hard carry roles and not getting involved in chat my advice is to learn zarya she is my goto tank character and every season carries me back up to diamond where she is not as effective as she is in lower brackets still viable for sure great pick but not as much as a carry but i found that players in gold plat just dont know how to properly deal with zarya the more they shoot me the higher charge i get and at charge zarya dominates the entire match she requires fast reactions bubble people getting hooked for example and a full understanding of how to offtank you really need to have a main tank for zarya to work with but if you can master her then youll quickly rise up through the ranks and carry yourself out regarding my part about avoiding chat yeah dont get involved if your team is actually communicating about the game over voice and whatnot then ofc get involved but from what ive seen it doesnt happen that often in the lower brackets and people tend to use chat to flame argue just stay silent during that even if they target you in their toxicity just ignore them and continue to play to the best you can its the best advice i can give i do understand that get out of silver is a lot easier said than done but if theres anything that ive learned by playing characters like zarya is that nothing is impossible you can carry toxic games even take the time to learn and practice with zarya because i will guarantee you that at silver people will not stop shooting you or others that you have bubbled generating huge amounts of charge and thus massive amounts of damage
Overwatch,not_removed,my primary question then is how do i know if its really my team or if the problem is me selfreproach you always suck that is the first thing you should understand to actually get betteralso decreases your toxic behaviour medals means nothing they only give you additional xp watch some pro plays slowly compare these plays with yours think about how to improve your gamestyle the most effecient way if you understand it on your own
Overwatch,not_removed,do you record your own matches i also have read all the tips guides and watched a lot of videos to learn play better but the biggest impact and improvement came from recording my matches and analyzing them later on when i watch my old matches i can better see what i couldve done differently and it has helped me a lot since
Overwatch,not_removed,is nothing special at all most people bounce around sr below their season high you simply cant just always win
Overwatch,not_removed,so for starters in anything below sr its a crap shoot of who throws less some things to know about this sr is that people often dont know what theyre doing so things like focus fire and not trickling in are mechanics of a fight that they often dont have with that being said try to find people that you find in your matches that are fun to play with and friend them and invite them to a discord or play with some friends you already have also what heros are you playing if you learn how to play zarya it will carry you all the way to at least because most people in that sr bracket dont know that shooting the zarya bubble charges her
Overwatch,not_removed,yes no i get the idea though good metric to keep track of in future
Overwatch,not_removed,thats three suggestions for zarya ill try that tomorrow thanks for the advice
Overwatch,not_removed,i do that as best i can i suppose the next step would really be to record my own games and play them back
Overwatch,not_removed,i primarily play dva because thats who im best with sometimes i switch for pharah but its pretty rare that im on a team that doesnt need another tank when i heal i go for lucio zaryas weird for me i havent previously been able to figure her out very well but ill definitely give her a go for a while and see how i do
Overwatch,not_removed,maining zarya got me out of gold in season 😍 im almost master now 😁
Overwatch,not_removed,basically no matter who you are playing dont die playing dps stay alive to do more damage even if you miss out on trading for playing tank stay alive to keep your team safe even if you could kill their tank or secondary playing healer stay alive just always stay alive playing sniper or symetra get that ult asap your ult is super vital to your team if you dont get an ult quick you arent doing it right
Overwatch,not_removed,no problem play her in quick play first dont jump straight into competitive with her she does require a lot of practice and knowledge but once you start carrying quick play matches which are a mess you will be able to carry yourself out of silver good luck
Overwatch,not_removed,part of what makes zarya really good for getting out of silver is that half her hp is shields and you mitigate a lot of damage using the bubbles your actual health does not take damage very often so you can do well even if your healers are terrible andor occupied with other things for the same reason roadhog is also amazing for getting out of low ranks he self heals and can get tons of kills with no help from his team you mentioned you play dva dva and winston are powerful but require a lot of healing to be good i generally dont play dva unless our team has an ana and a second healer
Overwatch,not_removed,decrease the amount of ineffective actions and increase the effective ones ive seen several silver players that move way too fast making tons of unnecessary shots jumps and rotations
Overwatch,not_removed,then he is bad andor dumb
Overwatch,not_removed,wha how
Overwatch,not_removed,technical explanation zarya started to move to her right just as the mech landed directly on her causing a continuation of motion on the push from the mech real explanation i made that up i have no idea
Overwatch,not_removed,i gotta try playing sombra at some point though i wouldve been randomly hooked by that roadhog
Overwatch,not_removed,not to be mean but ive had better
Overwatch,not_removed,just cause you main a character doesnt mean you cant switch ive always viewed the term main as preferred character not exclusive character ill main mei all day but ill still swap to a number of different characters if need be or if im bored
Overwatch,not_removed,while i agree that you need to form yourself to the situation and the team there are definitely some characters people are better and more comfortable playing than the rest
Overwatch,not_removed,i main different heroes on defense and attack but of course when shit goes south i switch to a particular character that can contribute but success rate on the heroes i dont main are
Overwatch,not_removed,i have hours on reinheardt hes an extremely valuable hero for any team composition on pretty much ever map and gamemode i think i can say im a reinheardt main at this point
Overwatch,not_removed,im a dva main but also play every other hero except tracer genji high noon guy and justice
Overwatch,not_removed,
Overwatch,not_removed,im a mcree main come at me bro
Overwatch,not_removed,i actually do not aggree with your very first statement i am a mercy main and the fact that i say main does not mean i stay to long on mercy since that is not an option she is usefull in attack defense and every state of the game so i would much rather not have a massive generalization post
Overwatch,not_removed,great but that isnt what the term is for most people main is used in mobas and you play something close to exlusivley and you cant do well at your level with other heroes
Overwatch,not_removed,you can but you shouldnt what purpose does it serve
Overwatch,not_removed,you dont bloody main genji you dont main reaper and you dont main tracer in gaming views since may httpwwwredditcomryoutubefactsbotwikiindex
Overwatch,not_removed,nah i rather stay out of the flashbang range thank you
Overwatch,not_removed,you can say main and switch all you want but that is not how the term is used
Overwatch,not_removed,thanks for the rez
Overwatch,not_removed,i think the community gets to decide how the term is used unit lost while great is not an authority on definitions judging by the response in this thread id say our overwatch community has decided main to mean preferred language evolves its not set in stone
Overwatch,not_removed,no one is an authority on definitions but the term is already defined by communities shall we make up new meanings for terms like support and such as well
Overwatch,not_removed,if the community agrees to a new meanings then sure im also pretty sure fighting games use the term main as best but not only
Overwatch,not_removed,because they are forced to play others as well main isnt a good term for promoting hero switching so why force the issue when it serves no purpose to use it other than habit
Overwatch,not_removed,the only reason youre forced to play another character is to counter pick your opponent that is exactly the same add overwatch i also believe this issue comes down to peoples personal enjoyment with the game at an individual level what they have the most fun with if people have these bad habits then i guess they arent going to play competitive or when they do theyll lean to switch
Overwatch,not_removed,must be sombra
Overwatch,not_removed,im sure theyll correct it for everyone that tried connecting during the ddos attack
Overwatch,not_removed,nothing you can do bro it is what it is no tears
Overwatch,not_removed,play on europe servers havent had any issues atm
Overwatch,not_removed,i hope because its not fun getting punish for those kid
Overwatch,not_removed,wouldnt i have crazy high ping
Overwatch,not_removed,those are obviously dads not granddads reinhardts everywhere are disappointed
Overwatch,not_removed,thats what custom games are here for you can play if you can only get people together you can play with spectaters if you have people and the best thing is you can set all of the rules the way you want you only wanna play ilios why not you want to respawn as a random hero its all in the settings
Overwatch,not_removed,the problem is when hes in turret form and healing with damage reduction
Overwatch,not_removed,the ultimate genji wallclimb fail part
Overwatch,not_removed,i loled
Overwatch,not_removed,in a weird way man i respect you wanting fairer games instead of just being like im higher than i should be her durr and trying to find a way to not ruin games for people i hope you find the rank that fits you
Overwatch,not_removed,im in the same position as you what platform
Overwatch,not_removed,dont you lose sr if you win and then leave before the victory screen since youd get the leaver penalty but you wouldnt have to throw the game for your team
Overwatch,not_removed,if its really not your rank youll go down with time without gimping yourself or manipulating matches
Overwatch,not_removed,thank you
Overwatch,not_removed,pc
Overwatch,not_removed,well thats the thing its the leaver penalty and i dont want that as it will eventually get me banned from competitive
Overwatch,not_removed,i win one match then lose two win one lose two and so on intentionally doing is is just faster
Overwatch,not_removed,xbox sorry man
Overwatch,not_removed,oooh thats true didnt even think about that xd sorry
Overwatch,not_removed,alright thanks for responding atleast
Overwatch,not_removed,the attention to detail blizzard presents in overwatch is kinda ridiculous when you look at it i mean in route the soda fountain has the icons of the zerg and a nod to dr balanced in the machine there are even laptops playing hearthstone
Overwatch,not_removed,if you try to hook anywhere on ecopoint antarctica the hook will go through your bug spray off your broadway play over the japanese dude sitting on my face and hit nothing but net
Overwatch,not_removed,it goes for ledges so it isnt almost impossible to aim
Overwatch,not_removed,you aint seen nothing yet
Overwatch,not_removed,nope you arent alone everyone wants it to be brought back
Overwatch,not_removed,no its a popular mode i dont know why its always the one to get dumped semirelated note it seems like a no brainer to just have a single vs mode where you can pick the number of players on each side
Overwatch,not_removed,his exwife probably left him
Overwatch,not_removed,it is possible it should be very rare in theory though it was a common complaint during the closed beta that for example australian players would get chucked onto us servers for no particular reason but it doesnt look like its happening in live
Overwatch,not_removed,so the servers are merged then and the region only affects your friend pool
Overwatch,not_removed,there are physical servers in various regions and countries capable of hosting games but i believe theres just one big server for account management purposes im obviously not familiar with the specific tech that theyre using but my understanding is that as far as accounts themselves are concerned overwatch only has one region
Overwatch,not_removed,supports why say that players in general you should say
Overwatch,not_removed,get thicker skin i guess it would be nice if people were mature enough to take personal responsibility when theyre losing hell even i cant all the time fuck tobjorne and everyone who plays him but th ats just never gonna happen and a ranking system just makes it worse i dont belong in elo hell its my shit teammates and all that sooo yea try to differentiate the legit criticisms like if you were dead for half the match as a healer and ignore the rambos who are convinced if you are their personal healing bitch theres no way your team can lose
Overwatch,not_removed,ignore them if they realize no one is acknowledging them theyll shut up
Overwatch,not_removed,tried death from above today as a mercy on volsk pharahs i need healing me ok no prob let me just pharahs all boost up and behind a structure me targetyousoi can fly overfaster pharahs die and respawn i need healing
Overwatch,not_removed,people in this game are blind to how bad they can potentially be because the game is set up to only reward players constantly hanzo and genji players get that constant stream of kills for just being minority involved in offenses or picking off lucky shots so to them getting the gold medal for kills is the gold standard for how theyre doing even if their kills dont end up doing much ive heard several people in the game get furious when i suggest that theres more to winning than just kills many many many people think a higher kdr is what should account for a victory and not time defending the point harassment forcing enemy teams back or in a corner or anything else well get wrecked on hanamura because only two people could stand on the point and hanzo and will squabble about kdr like their kills were putting seconds on the objective timers so its two fold players legitimately dont understand that only the objective not kdr matters and this is reinforced by almost every stat and metric that the game displays and players refuse to see themselves as anything but toptier players having an off day
Overwatch,not_removed,playing lucio is like herding cats sometimes when i get an unreasonable i need healing demand i usually just reply with group up with me hopefully they get the idea i do the same thing to let them know my ult is ready
Overwatch,not_removed,nope especially towards teammates that you feel should have my back and protect me from my suicidal feelings so supports and tanks are the main targets
Overwatch,not_removed,i think you got a good point i dont really share ops views that much ive played this game every day since release and i also played the crap out of competetive when it was released yesterday in my experience supports doesnt get flamed more then other roles infact in my or so ranked games yesterday i dont think i saw a healer get flamed a single time if people are constantly criticising your skills as a healer then maybe you should look away from omg such toxic for a second and try to reflect on your perfomance
Overwatch,not_removed,please dont single out lol specifically as if its somehow different just about every competitive game where you play with a team is the same this is the way the internet works even in noncompetitive games like wow youll still get flamed for being shit in a dungeon regardless of whether its going smoothly or not exceptions are games with rather small populations or games that are relatively new
Overwatch,not_removed,that applies in reverse as well since the damage dealers job is to protect the ones that cant protect themselves so yes its interdependent healers protect damage dealers and damage dealers protect healers
Overwatch,not_removed,in wow youll be flamed for being shit but in league youll be flamed if the flamer is shit and cant admit it league is one of the worst communities known to gaming for sure and i wouldnt be surprised if plenty of the worst players in overwatch came from there
Overwatch,not_removed,exactly thats why those players are toxic and feel entitled for no reason
Overwatch,not_removed,so i was right in saying all players not just supports
Overwatch,not_removed,typical solo flankers wont flame other mates that have no ability to helpsave them
Overwatch,not_removed,if you know you have to be somewhere or that theres a possibility youll be interrupted and asked to do something dont start up a game of comp
Overwatch,not_removed,chuffy dude the punishment isnt for joining another match its for abandoning your team midmatch the system wont slot in a new player for that team so you get punished for throwing the game
Overwatch,not_removed,umm no
Overwatch,not_removed,i dont think thats fair because im getting suspended for turning off my console and do you think its fair to the other people in your team in competitive that they will now most likely lose their game as because you decided to switch off your console midmatch if you cant be bothered to play a full game of competitive or need to go somewhere dont play competitive
Overwatch,not_removed,youre mom gay
Overwatch,not_removed,i stopped giving a shit what people say if i want to play a certain hero then i will within reason i try not to double up on heroes or play defenseoffense when a healer or tank is needed but in the end its just a game play how you want and screw what other people think or say
Overwatch,not_removed,i wouldnt worry about it too much the ones crying that people should uninstall or some other such nonsense tend to be of the mouth breathing sort who play hero regardless of need theyll find themselves at the bottom of the mmr bin soon enough where they can all circle jerk themselves to bastion widowmaker porn and leave us grown ups to scream about mei
Overwatch,not_removed,when i pick a new hero i usually mention it in team chat up front trying out dva any tips usually get a positive response and lowers their expectation also helps if the new hero you are trying is not hanzo or widowmaker p people are especially sensitive about those ones
Overwatch,not_removed,as long as people are trying to play the objective flankers notwithstanding i dont mind if theyre not very good hell im pretty damn bad myself but i cant stand when people go off doing their own thing at the expense of the team that includes hero choice to a certain extent if we have no healer and no tank with picks left choosing another tracer is just going to make things shitty for the rest of the team its okay to be bad just try to play the game instead of treating it like team deathmatch
Overwatch,not_removed,i agree i really want to practice getting good at widow maker but since my aim is pretty average i just feel like im going to let the team down ai just dont cut it when it comes practice maybe when competitive rolls around quick play will be a more reasonable place to try things out in
Overwatch,not_removed,i block those players no need to read their chat
Overwatch,not_removed,just play what you want and make generous use of the mute option if people rage at you
Overwatch,not_removed,i really do hope so
Overwatch,not_removed,theres also no excuse to be a dick and flame people over a game if youve got nothing nice to say dont say it at all
Overwatch,not_removed,guides vids dont help you aim better thats all practice
Overwatch,not_removed,guides doesnt instantly make you good at the hero you need experience
Overwatch,not_removed,or a robot
Overwatch,not_removed,thats like saying that since my toaster isnt female it must be male bastion is a robot why assume it has any gender
Overwatch,not_removed,or it doesnt have a gender because its a robot
Overwatch,not_removed,
Overwatch,not_removed,are you implying theres only two genders triggered
Overwatch,not_removed,did you just assume bastions gender
Overwatch,not_removed,overchat is pretty entertaining
Overwatch,not_removed,the guys of your overwatch do an interesting podcast every friday too check his twitch channel
Overwatch,not_removed,thanks i will give it a try now
Overwatch,not_removed,oohh is that what the objective of the game is
Overwatch,not_removed,no u
Overwatch,not_removed,not worth waiting imo they probably wont drop for weeks
Overwatch,not_removed,huh im nearing level holding off on leveling hadnt even occurred to me
Overwatch,not_removed,ugh that would be harsh if they aint up oct im just digging in
Overwatch,not_removed,is hours a day for a month considering casually lol
Overwatch,not_removed,i got it at launch and im just hitting now so im not confident i would get another before halloween
Overwatch,not_removed,thats a lot more than casual
Overwatch,not_removed,i envision it running from about the last two weeks of october weeks from now through the first two weeks of november so the event centres right around halloween
Overwatch,not_removed,yes hours a day in esports is causally some teams have practice times like till open end sunday thursday
Overwatch,not_removed,i assumed it would be like a combination of wows halloween thing which ends on halloween and how the olympic event ran for a solid month i guess well just have to see how it goes
Overwatch,not_removed,i assume that had been sitting in queue forever and they game finally caved and threw together the best it could but yeah pretty rubbish ive seen a lot of similar occurances in other games though
Overwatch,not_removed,matchmaking is rigged af
Overwatch,not_removed,well i mean at least you only lost sr
Overwatch,not_removed,feels bad
Overwatch,not_removed,the top player in our team were furious and triggered you cant undo that
Overwatch,not_removed,i mean i would be too this is how matchmaking works in most ratingelo games if you lose to players you should lose to meaning when you get put into these situations you lose virtually no points in this case two when you lose a equally matched game you win and lose points accordingly so youre not losing much in terms of points but mr top losing to plats diamonds and yes some higher ranked top players sets him back much worse meanwhile the top players on the enemy team probably only won like points from their win also hes a top player being put onto a shield slavetank hero when he should be dps to carry
Overwatch,not_removed,were you on a win streak
Overwatch,not_removed,hes the one who insta pick reinhardt so we cant do anything about it
Overwatch,not_removed,no it was our first competitive match of the day
Overwatch,not_removed,i have no answer lol i guess random luck said lets do it
Overwatch,not_removed,streaks dont reset each day and they dont time out afaik
Overwatch,not_removed,no hate on the game but i think the system need to be updated maybe it miscalculated into since our average is and
Overwatch,not_removed,i believe its a form of yukata
Overwatch,not_removed,tldr op got hooked and is salty about it
Overwatch,not_removed,one shots are mildly okay for snipers thats literally the point of a sniper i think a longer hook cooldown is more reasonable than anything else
Overwatch,not_removed,git gud
Overwatch,not_removed,lol the salt is real
Overwatch,not_removed,road isnt op calm down bro
Overwatch,not_removed,just dont get hooked by roadhog easy
Overwatch,not_removed,well someone came up against a good roadhog op git gud and start dodging
Overwatch,not_removed,bait hooks attack from a distance use zarya rein dva mark with discord what else
Overwatch,not_removed,git gud
Overwatch,not_removed,do yourself a favor and go play roadhog for a while seriously try it
Overwatch,not_removed,i agree if youre going to flame me at least put on your big boy pants and flame me with your voice instead of wasting time typing out insults
Overwatch,not_removed,coming from wow casual lol with friends and a bunch of other games i was decent at used a mic for ill take silent people over people that dont know what pushtotalk is any day of the week dont get me wrong more people with mics push to talk is better than less but ive had a couple games where midgame someone has left a new player has joined and has a mic thats just toggled on and i basically have to wait until deathi somehow have a free few seconds to go into the channel menu and mute them anyway like really i had a guy come in yesterday who was in hero select and discussing with his brother slowly if he should choose torbjorn or not we dont need to hear your discussion guy
Overwatch,not_removed,ill usually use my mic for callouts and to say hi at the start of a comp match but dont use it much otherwise because i am a being comprised of sodium and my teammates dont need to hear that shit that said id definitely like to see more people using the mic even if its just for callouts or to say hey youre overextending slow it down
Overwatch,not_removed,i have my mic muted because ive had way too many people spam it by singing or humming the whole game
Overwatch,not_removed,i usually heal or tank i just make call outs if people join in it makes the game more fun usually solo queue because i work swing and graves so none of my irl friends are awake i try to just have fun and if we win we win if we lose i die a little on the inside if anyone works odd hours add me us west coast
Overwatch,not_removed,at the start of the match i always type in team chat that im on the team voice channel and suggest they come too im your reinhardt and ill call out what i see and what i do from experience when people join stuff happens what i call for and wins are raining in when nobody joins team chat channel its a russian roulette quick match game further i ask for a luciomercy combo which makes games so much more winnable
Overwatch,not_removed,if youre going to flame me at least put on your big boy pants and flame me with your voice instead this written insults dont count its like talking about you can kiss my ass it only counts if you will pull down your pants and show him that you are not joking around
Overwatch,not_removed,second part is completely true in halo some of the most important callouts are i have your help here slow it down then you have your location callouts which were pretty good to have too
Overwatch,not_removed,point proven lol just a bit of communication makes things easier and yeah feels like competitive is just quick match
Overwatch,not_removed,competitive should be split into people having mics and have autojoin team chat channel on and into those who have not autojoin team chat channel
Overwatch,not_removed,that seams like a fair adjustment for blizzard to do
Overwatch,not_removed,not fucking over your teammates unfortunately there is no reason that benefits the dcer though
Overwatch,not_removed,if you leave and reconnect youll only get a loss if you never reconnect youll get leavers penality too if you never reconnect repeatedly youll be banned from ranked for the season pretty strong incentive id say
Overwatch,not_removed,your heart of gold which isnt enough blizzpls
Overwatch,not_removed,the one time i got deced it didnt give me an option to reconnect in the first place
Overwatch,not_removed,my isp came and replaced our old crappy modem and router yesterday and now my internet goes out for a few seconds every now and then for no reason this happened to me times in ranked each time i came back within seconds won the game and still get a loss its so stupid
Overwatch,not_removed,do you get leaver if you dont rejoin
Overwatch,not_removed,would it break something if getting kicked still gives a loss but if you rejoin back and your team wins you also get a win could that be exploited
Overwatch,not_removed,only your honor is at stake
Overwatch,not_removed,helping your team thats it pretty much
Overwatch,not_removed,every game that i have ever crashedhad to rejoin for any reason has had at least one person besides me leave after i had left just because it was safe for them to leave so honestly even though it isnt your fault it kind of is my friends even tell the other people that i am coming back but they still leave
Overwatch,not_removed,this is a pretty shit system i can foresee people just joining to afk while occasionally alt tabbing to not get the afk option
Overwatch,not_removed,i am going to home
Overwatch,not_removed,buy your own modem and router especially if you are paying a rental fee it will pay for itself
Overwatch,not_removed,yes
Overwatch,not_removed,i guess that would be the reason then
Overwatch,not_removed,lol no
Overwatch,not_removed,the problem with that is that the ptr is blizzards testing platform if people get rewarded for abusing broken heroes again testing platform blizzard would be more conservative in testing ideas and the part of the community that doesnt play the ptr will feel slighted it wont happen
Overwatch,not_removed,no not a chance dont play ptr if you want loot and experiences you play test to see whats coming down the pipe and get an early advantage plus theres bugs and exploits so no purple should not be rewarded
Overwatch,not_removed,dont play ptr if you want anything more than new content early
Overwatch,not_removed,your reward for playing on the ptr is getting to try out things before the general playerbase which is actually very useful with things like new maps
Overwatch,not_removed,why its the ptr i dont understand the logic of i play this game for skins and voice lines and loot boxes sorry i play to win and have fun loot boxes and levels are meaningless but cool add ins play cs go if that is so important to you
Overwatch,not_removed,yeah fuck purple its not even a real color
Overwatch,not_removed,damnit phone
Overwatch,not_removed,she basically saying its her cat smh
Overwatch,not_removed,lets just hack her router and re route our internet to her internet so it makes it faster and then boom sombra revealed gg s
Overwatch,not_removed,a week ago i would be hyped because of this now i just couldnt care less its probably only a clue to another clue to another clue to another countdown thx bizzard
Overwatch,not_removed,and now its up to transmitiendo información a ómnicos activos
Overwatch,not_removed,keklmao
Overwatch,not_removed,who fucking cares
Overwatch,not_removed,i can do this with my eyes closed
Overwatch,not_removed,you forgot to type ez
Overwatch,not_removed,jeff goldblum as soldier soldiers uh find a way
Overwatch,not_removed,victory song
Overwatch,not_removed,its his gaming chair
Overwatch,not_removed,up voting because of your ingame username
Overwatch,not_removed,pure skill
Overwatch,not_removed,well there it is
Overwatch,not_removed,what is the point if anything thisll make you miss shots cause you lose focus on the enemy
Overwatch,not_removed,ive got you in my sights aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa ive still got it
Overwatch,not_removed,fuck jeff goldblum
Overwatch,not_removed,death finds a way
Overwatch,not_removed,soldier ult in a nutshell
Overwatch,not_removed,c r i s p c l e a n l o c k b o i s
Overwatch,not_removed,brilliant i could hear you scream ora ora ora from here
Overwatch,not_removed,i said thanks fam at all the reactions instead
Overwatch,not_removed,that was disturbing
Overwatch,not_removed,very fitting for the pullout king
Overwatch,not_removed,absolutely
Overwatch,not_removed,came for jeff goldblum stayed for jeff goldblum
Overwatch,not_removed,hes ulting his shots wont miss
Overwatch,not_removed,actually its more uh uh uh
Overwatch,not_removed,yes but if you move your mouse that much it could lose the lock on and then fundamentally not hit anyone moving the mouse and not moving the mouse changes nothing
Overwatch,not_removed,yeah but he got potg so it worked
Overwatch,not_removed,same with me i have origins too and im scared of getting banned as well lets just hope
Overwatch,not_removed,i wouldnt be too worried they might give you a warning idk ive used glitches like the symmetra dorado bridge glitch and got reported nothing ever came of it
Overwatch,not_removed,that would be a giant buff to her ult its interesting idea but dont think it would happen
Overwatch,not_removed,rate of fire or damage increase
Overwatch,not_removed,instead of stopping when taking damage while hacking slow it down or allow her to hack while invisible to better deal with turrets
Overwatch,not_removed,any hack has an initial stun followed by a decaying movement speed slow can hack while invisible translocator can be detonated like a mini emp or enough bullets landed a hack just some ideas
Overwatch,not_removed,what pisses me off is that we just need more player to have all and it cancels the entire match back to the menu
Overwatch,not_removed,time after time im taken out from a waiting for players match to be put into another damn waiting for players match and times out of the matches im taken out of were almost full why do you do this
Overwatch,not_removed,the communty already talked about this a hundred times blizzard is making some change on both qp and ranked matchmaking so you could possibly expect longer waiting in queue as well as match starting and then cancelling
Overwatch,not_removed,no im not talking about skrimishes read the title
Overwatch,not_removed,i didnt say skirmish games i have that disabled have you actually never gotten a waiting for players lobby because i highly doubt you havent
Overwatch,not_removed,skirmish and waiting for players are different things skirmish is the option as you said you are able to disable that waiting for players is when you find a gane but there are not players ready to start the match instead you just get set in to a pre match mode called waiting for players and once all players have been found the game starts on the same map you already are on but recently there has been a drastic increase in those lobbys and of the time you het kicked out of them because the game could not find enough players resulting in you going back to the main menu and starting the whole thing over again
Overwatch,not_removed,
Overwatch,not_removed,i literally have skirmish turned off no its a different thing completely stop giving me idiotic responses when you all clearly have no clue what youre talking about
Overwatch,not_removed,many many many people complain about this read the thread
Overwatch,not_removed,soo you feel the hook being cheap in a so your solution to that is if you get a kill it resets like genjis swift strike may the blizzard gods forbid that gets into the hands of an amazing roadhog player
Overwatch,not_removed,no lets not have it reset if you get a kill i have pretty good aim with it and have close to hours as roadhog you would just be destroying people with hooks kills left and right if you have a mercy babysitting you
Overwatch,not_removed,i play a lot of tracer and mccree roadhog is one of the most infuriating heroes to face but i feel like the hook is ok right now i think the healing is a little over the top i ended up dealing damage to one roadhog only to end up dying healpackmercyheal
Overwatch,not_removed,this would be even worse the main problem with roadhog is that hes swingy theres an insane difference between landing a hook and missing a hook increasing his cooldown but letting it reset would be awful as it would increase this difference even further there is counterplay to the hook you can anticipate it and juke the roadhog if youre playing at a low level or in qp where players have absolutely awful movement and dont respond to enemies then roadhog probably feels ultra cheap
Overwatch,not_removed,i constantly keep getting oneko kill while playing rh in qm you mean i could get more kill than i should already sure
Overwatch,not_removed,i see two potential fixes to roadhog fix the vertical hitbox let player aim and fire once hooked instead of being stunned otherwise hes fine as is
Overwatch,not_removed,hook already has a low cooldown so i say no
Overwatch,not_removed,i just put myself the alarm to wake up and play with the reworked bastion but nouuuu
Overwatch,not_removed,same here guess the patch will be out later
Overwatch,not_removed,was it pst if so thats like in europe i think gmt but that doesnt explain why the maintenance thing is gone maybe the launcher shows you the correct maintenance time for your region and the patch is just late i dont wanna wait till this afternoon
Overwatch,not_removed,patches usually go live around my time so in hours
Overwatch,not_removed,same xd
Overwatch,not_removed,was it maybe not am im really doubting my brain right now d
Overwatch,not_removed,its just sextuple i wouldnt want to see a sextuplet killed
Overwatch,not_removed,pre nerf triggered
Overwatch,not_removed,its rare that the potg spray comes in the middle of the highlight
Overwatch,not_removed,i miss the old genji
Overwatch,not_removed,lol my name is lemon we should play together
Overwatch,not_removed,i had a mccree deflection kill yesterday that i was really annoyed didnt get potg he didnt see me coming and i dropped down from above him and deflected as i fell past worse part was he got potg for just shooting me in the head when i started my ult and then killing one other person
Overwatch,not_removed,this clip made me kinda realize just how op old sword was thing lasted forever sheesh
Overwatch,not_removed,real annoying that he can deflect some ults
Overwatch,not_removed,the gold genji
Overwatch,not_removed,my eternal brother
Overwatch,not_removed,deflect is seconds mccree ult is seconds
Overwatch,not_removed,mccree can just wait for deflect to end
Overwatch,not_removed,its hard as balls to plul off on most and most other heroes have more efficient ways of dealing with ults anyway
Overwatch,not_removed,talkin bout the pro genji
Overwatch,not_removed,not to mention in this my reflect only lasted a bit under half a second kinda dumb how people can say things like this where it was not skillful
Overwatch,not_removed,set on his goals genji
Overwatch,not_removed,i hate the new genji
Overwatch,not_removed,ult genji
Overwatch,not_removed,i had a guy using a beeper one beep for yes two beeps for no
Overwatch,not_removed,is that serious
Overwatch,not_removed,beep

Overwatch,not_removed,only a shimada can control the hitboxes
Overwatch,not_removed,genji
Overwatch,not_removed,come on bro
Overwatch,not_removed,i love how he just flops over the ledge
Overwatch,not_removed,how
Overwatch,not_removed,the question is why your first reaction was to throw a meter shuriken rather than deflecting
Overwatch,not_removed,brothers die together
Overwatch,not_removed,except your projectile actually hit his character model
Overwatch,not_removed,til that the camper model on the left of the screen at the start of the gif is tyrael
Overwatch,not_removed,hahaha that was sick
Overwatch,not_removed,this is so fucking unfair whenever i shoot a rocket with pharah and die it disappears miles away but here no fucking way its shimada with their bullshit again
Overwatch,not_removed,i am glad you didnt fall victim to tickupdate rate
Overwatch,not_removed,as an older brother i always get this warm fuzzy feeling inside when i heard that he loves his brother and his brother loves him though he doesnt know it
Overwatch,not_removed,i am panic and try to hit my lmb but then i realize it is hanzo and try to hit e as quick as possible but it is too late which cause me throw one shiruken out
Overwatch,not_removed,same way hanzo does it he fired a projectile but got killed before it hit
Overwatch,not_removed,ive had this happen to me playing genji too i think it relates to the fact that the genji pressed e so late that the arrow already registered as hitting him but the end of arrow ended up hitting the deflect hitbox thus ricocheting and killing hanzo
Overwatch,not_removed,when the time i realize it is a hanzo and it is too late
Overwatch,not_removed,youve obviously got a badsuboptimal connection that kind of thing will only happen on where the server registers your death before it registers your projectile because your death is more important on it will register your projectile instantly then your death because its fast enough to catch them both the instant they occur
Overwatch,not_removed,wait doesnt he say that when he melee kills someone from behind as in backstabbing someone
Overwatch,not_removed,hes saying it in response to murdering someone like his brother tried to murder him youre taking that quote and putting the wrong spin on it friend
Overwatch,not_removed,oh sweet summer child
Overwatch,not_removed,no he pressed lmb
Overwatch,not_removed,i would already be deflecting on the way to the health pack and dash would have been up by the time deflect was over
Overwatch,not_removed,o dam lol
Overwatch,not_removed,only a shimada can control the roasts
Overwatch,not_removed,if this is true godaammm
Overwatch,not_removed,i done goofed obviously s
Overwatch,not_removed,watch the slomo he presses e so quickly that the cooldown timer doesnt even start but you can see the animation around the e button also the animation that plays is the deflect one not shiruken
Overwatch,not_removed,everyone i need to tell people that im the best genji
Overwatch,not_removed,he presses lmb one shuriken gets tossed as clearly evident by the fact that a shuriken gets thrown out green no drop and cancels this animation with deflect but is too late and doesnt get activated server side he gets hit with the arrow dies and his shuriken that has since long been thrown hits hanzo no arrow is deflected nor can it be if he got hit by said arrow
Overwatch,not_removed,is that a pro genji
Overwatch,not_removed,you are not a true shimada
Overwatch,not_removed,even though sidewalkenforcer is wrong you can still get hit by it and deflect it it does happen
Overwatch,not_removed,n no then your reflected projectile will get deleted sort of like how if you die as pharah just after shooting you can see your rocket dissapear happened pretty frequently back when they had tick servers
Overwatch,not_removed,dva all me
Overwatch,not_removed,best use of sleep dart ive seen yet
Overwatch,not_removed,that reinhardt thought he was going to be the hero for his team until he drifted into nappy land
Overwatch,not_removed,i like how dvas ult just barely got through the door there
Overwatch,not_removed,the true potg
Overwatch,not_removed,well the comms for the enemies is now people screaming at the reinhardt asking why he dropped his shield
Overwatch,not_removed,ive done the complete reverse shoot dart as dva launches ult put ultimate to sleep ult stops moving in the middle of team team kill assist
Overwatch,not_removed,its sad that such amazing support play is often overlooked great job op
Overwatch,not_removed,i know this is kinda off topic but anas darts seem really hard to land for me like i feel like i have to be spot on accurate and sometimes i feel like i am dead on aim and it misses i dont know whats going on then like if youre aimed dead at an enemy but a friendly is sligtly even close to your aim the dart hits the friendly instead even if they have full health i love playing ana but these things are frustrating me is it just me
Overwatch,not_removed,had this happen to me and i immediately stopped playing reinhardt uninstalled the game and set myself on fire
Overwatch,not_removed,these things are so play of the game worthy i wish overwatchs algorithm acknowledged these playmakers
Overwatch,not_removed,i watch potgs like this and im like wow thats a good ana but i honestly just cannot get into playing her i think shes clunky has poor mobility and just isnt that fun am i alone i tried to like her i really did
Overwatch,not_removed,elinotanoverwatchplayer
Overwatch,not_removed,if bastion gets darted does he dream of electric sheep
Overwatch,not_removed,now thats what i like to call teamworkwhycantanyofmyteammatesdothat
Overwatch,not_removed,get behindzzzzz
Overwatch,not_removed,go to sleep forever
Overwatch,not_removed,same thing happened to me same map same position i was like hah i am a reinhardt i can block it with my shgets sleep darted dva quadruple kill me fuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuu
Overwatch,not_removed,teamwork op fix pls blizz
Overwatch,not_removed,another reminder that not all heroes wear capes though this one wears an awesome cloak
Overwatch,not_removed,you can interrupt call meka with it also i shot a dva who was in the middle of the animation the meka just poofed and it was pilot dva sleepy time
Overwatch,not_removed,looks like nana and gramps are mad at each other again
Overwatch,not_removed,well done
Overwatch,not_removed,perfect
Overwatch,not_removed,this one actually got me to say holy shit out loud thats an incredibly well used sleep dart
Overwatch,not_removed,nice today i was super proud of myself because i pulled something similar with mcree only killed reinhart tho
Overwatch,not_removed,this is why i love ana
Overwatch,not_removed,thats pretty mad
Overwatch,not_removed,the kind of ana i never get on my teams
Overwatch,not_removed,amazing
Overwatch,not_removed,i used it on a genji that was about to hit me with the ult it was nice me and the genji became friends after it
Overwatch,not_removed,i sleep dart everyone dragon blade gengi sleep dart whole hog sleep dart death blossom sleep dart lol 💤💤💤
Overwatch,not_removed,
Overwatch,not_removed,perf
Overwatch,not_removed,i did something like that once except i woke up the already sleeping reinhardt and then promptly lost the game when reinhardt got nana boosted and wiped my team
Overwatch,not_removed,ouch i can only imagine the enemy team we are safe guys dont wo
Overwatch,not_removed,beautiful
Overwatch,not_removed,i couldnt be mad i think at that moment i understood girlfriends and wives everywhere when their partners are bring silly its stupid and a little irritating but still funny
Overwatch,not_removed,sick moves
Overwatch,not_removed,he raged flaming blizzard for their poor net code and bugs i had my shield up
Overwatch,not_removed,not gonna lie my heart stopped for a moment in anticipation that was great timing
Overwatch,not_removed,are we the same person we have the same username brother
Overwatch,not_removed,pretty sick play man
Overwatch,not_removed,and that dva got an achievement for it if they didnt already have it so you made the day for your team too bad most times something like this happens it gets completely overlooked by the game and most of the players
Overwatch,not_removed,wow another great use of the dart
Overwatch,not_removed,
Overwatch,not_removed,now now let me tuck you in ana
Overwatch,not_removed,beautifully done these are the little nuances of the game that make it so great that tiny moment could completely have changed the outcome of the game after that this game is full of moments like this its never over until the very last overtime second people forget how much of a difference one great moment can have on this game
Overwatch,not_removed,and people probably told you no ana plz
Overwatch,not_removed,i really wish you could get potg for stuff like this ive had tons of ana games where i felt like i was carrying but you never get any recognition in the postgame score cards are tough too since you usually wont be healing
Overwatch,not_removed,i did the same exact thing but its a lot less worth sharing when the dva only gets kills out it after
Overwatch,not_removed,had an ana on this map earlier in comp basically threw the game unlike most i dont mind ana on my team aside from certain maps this being one of them we really needed a zen asked over a dozen times nicely and the guy wouldnt even respond both in chat and in voice all he said all game was some stupid shit about some dumb thing that happened when he finally switched to mccree so i could zen we won rounds after being third round we got to and they won the ot after killing us so we lost but im sure we couldve won if we had a zen from round bugs the crap out of me when people play a hero on a map they arent that great on and wont switch she can work on this map but its far from one of her best rant over this just reminded me of that match and gave me flashbacks although my ana was a bit on the retarded side not like this one
Overwatch,not_removed,i wish i was smart enough to devise an algorithm to give potg to the ana instead of dva
Overwatch,not_removed,pretty ingenious trick
Overwatch,not_removed,sleep well
Overwatch,not_removed,sure reaper would have gotten hit if this was me
Overwatch,not_removed,wow ure a man gg
Overwatch,not_removed,coming from rall and i dont play the game much could someone explain whats happening
Overwatch,not_removed,its plays like this that should get play of the game instead the dva will get it
Overwatch,not_removed,i still dont like ana her sleep dart pretty much is just a less good roadhog hook plus she takes the place of a healer despite being one of the weakest healers thanks to her dual damage and healing attack personally i thinking alternate firing modes would be better lots of times ive played ana just to heal a fully healed tank instead of dealing a finishing blow because the tank stepped in front albeit as theyre supposed to do i just find her a weak character no mobility sniper is just useless give her the same clamber ability as hanzo at least
Overwatch,not_removed,no offense but that was nothing special rein hard like seconds of not having his shield in anas direction
Overwatch,not_removed,prob got potg for it to
Overwatch,not_removed,to be fair she got people in total meaning there were two in the hallway she caused reinhart to look away meaning the rest of the her team could mop up the two left over pretty easily if that sleep dart had missed it was a good play without the dart the dart made it a great play
Overwatch,not_removed,i mean thats still a good dva ult no matter what
Overwatch,not_removed,i prefer destroying high noon and whole hog with sleep darts but im definitely stealing this trick too
Overwatch,not_removed,ive been playing a lot of ana recently and nothing will make you hate your team more than when you sleep dart the enemy nano boosted reinhardt only for your team to shoot him and wake him up
Overwatch,not_removed,to be honest im not sure where the rest of the enemy team are some could be running back from spawn through that corridor i only see enemy run behind rein if that was the case he would have only protected guy
Overwatch,not_removed,
Overwatch,not_removed,old man needs to nap sorry team
Overwatch,not_removed,i too watched the gif
Overwatch,not_removed,wait you can put mech without pilot to sleep wtf is in that sleep darts
Overwatch,not_removed,you can stop the mekas launch momentum after dvas out of it kinda surprising
Overwatch,not_removed,i play a lot of support and would say i get way too much credit if anything sitting around healing isnt hard but i get all the thanks meanwhile someone having a godlike game hardly gets noticed unless they get potg
Overwatch,not_removed,is it though
Overwatch,not_removed,no in fact many times we support players get praise more than we should cant name how many amazing plays that ive seen done by my tank teammates that go unnoticed
Overwatch,not_removed,that could be said about literally any character in overwatch support tank dps or defensive
Overwatch,not_removed,thats by design they have a bigger hotbox against friendlies than enemies go to the training room and shoot around allyenemy bots you can aim for air and hit allies but enemy bots need to be dead on so youll often be unable to shoot around allies
Overwatch,not_removed,just have to understand her and i love playing her hrs on her anas darts are a projectile while unscoped you have to predict hitscan when scoped in then if you are scoped in within triangular area any ally gets healed even while full health even if theres an enemy in the center crosshair better to play her as an healeramazing utility than a damage dealer so give preference to healing allies over hitting enemies her sleep dart is a projectile as well so try a predict where they will be a half a second later
Overwatch,not_removed,are you talking about the sleep dart or healing projectile the dart cant hit your allies but yes its not easy at all to hit with it
Overwatch,not_removed,the darts are designed so that you can heal easier than you can damage enemies she wouldnt be a good support of you had to be pin point exact
Overwatch,not_removed,thats a reasonable reaction
Overwatch,not_removed,its pretty hard to calculate and detect though
Overwatch,not_removed,and the fact that its not potg worthy you would still need the dva ult for this to happen
Overwatch,not_removed,just isnt your style i wont play mccree for pretty much the same reasons you listed but i love ana
Overwatch,not_removed,the only thing she lacks mobility shes not clunky at all to be honest she can deal with a lot of threatsesp solo flankers and especially after rof buff pretty decent healing too
Overwatch,not_removed,the reason shes clunky is because her heals ult and alt fire are so strong she would be too strong if she was more mobile
Overwatch,not_removed,shes high skill like genjo tbh shes potentially the best support to have on your team if shes played right sort of like genjo
Overwatch,not_removed,anas my favorite hero by far i love playing her because i can dish out a ridiculous amount of heals from afar up to hp in less than seconds to be exact without actually being in danger unlike mercy she can outburst most damage dealers in terms of keeping other heroes alive and the feeling of bringing a reinhardt or winston back from certain death like below hp while hes in a fight and then using all that healing to cap off your ult boost him and watch him go on a rampagegod damn its awesome not only that but she can shut down ultimates with a sleep dart provide some ancillary dps from range poke turrets easily and she does just enough damage to hold her own against flankers if your aim is good enough ana is hard as fuck to master but once you get to that level she can solo heal everyone with zero problems
Overwatch,not_removed,same and ofc i got a legendary skin of hers it is just her young it looks worse than default skin fie
Overwatch,not_removed,the flashing robot that flew across the room was about to explode and the explosion would kill all the enemy players except that big guy holding the big glowing rectangle was shielding them so right before the bomb went off op hit the big guy with a sleep dart making him drop his shield and therefore wiping the enemy team
Overwatch,not_removed,no harrison ford thats his fetish
Overwatch,not_removed,nah bastion is not an android
Overwatch,not_removed,do you do your part and use voip in game
Overwatch,not_removed,these markov chain bots are really weird
Overwatch,not_removed,that greenish explosion dvas ult kills everyone around it the character beside it reinhardt had raised his shield protecting his allies and himself but the author of the gif put him to sleep with a sleep dart just before the explosion making him lower his shield and getting him and his allies killed
Overwatch,not_removed,well considering the dva was more necessary in this potg than the ana no the dva ult was still the thing that killed the four people
Overwatch,not_removed,or a rocket jump like phara d
Overwatch,not_removed,nah it probably went to a lucio knocking some dude off the map since the game thinks thats so impressive
Overwatch,not_removed,you must main dva d
Overwatch,not_removed,i had a game the other day where our ana stopped three death blossoms with it it was pretty inspiring
Overwatch,not_removed,i managed to hit a genji that used his ult just for me i just let him sleep until his ult ran out
Overwatch,not_removed,today an enemy ana ulted the roadhog who then ulted i sleep darted him and get the naptime achievement it was a great feeling
Overwatch,not_removed,its high noon guess its time for your siesta then thunk
Overwatch,not_removed,jesus christ times i had a chance to get that achievement on high noon and times i just ended up killing him fuck
Overwatch,not_removed,the rest couldve been behind that panel next to rein
Overwatch,not_removed,holy shit thats us in the games we played last night i was playing lucio our entire team was behind the reinharts shields
Overwatch,not_removed,baaa ba ba ba ba baaa ba ba ba ba ba
Overwatch,not_removed,c
Overwatch,not_removed,well you can put bastion to sleep somehow that sleep dart must have the power of a tank canon to pierce some of the armour it pierces
Overwatch,not_removed,sleepdll
Overwatch,not_removed,or drop table meka
Overwatch,not_removed,dvas sleep animation is her struggling with the controls while the mech lays there uselessly since it works on zenyatta and bastion too im guessing it has a some sort of antitechnology component
Overwatch,not_removed,yeah meka is treated as a player some weird situations develop when you sleep it all of its momentum stops however its explosion doesnt as far as i can tell meka is treated exactly like a player when dva is outside of it and inside of it
Overwatch,not_removed,yeah healers almost always get their card voted up at least once my friend got votes for his card the first time while playing mercy not saying support shouldnt be appreciated but the guy that got objective kills on defense should get some credit too
Overwatch,not_removed,support mains have a very woe is me i am so underappreciated thing they throw around but as long as ive played they get almost every card and friend invites its almost comical especially because they need me as a tank far less than i need them these days
Overwatch,not_removed,agreed you always see the lucio with healing get a lot of votes but the soldier with elims and golds doesnt get anything oh well glad people appreciate supports
Overwatch,not_removed,its a more selfless role than dps killing people is more fun than healing i view voting for the healer as a way of saying thanks
Overwatch,not_removed,i could see that for a lucio or something but an ana wont be getting a card or a potg the vast majority of the time unless the team is doing terribly
Overwatch,not_removed,healing is easy except for ana a little bit its the way you use the rest of your kit that makes you excel as a support not healing
Overwatch,not_removed,yeah with any support that isnt ana this is true even with the changes to her so shes actually fucking amazing and feels just as good as other healers granted with a slightly smaller propensity for healing nongrouped people than mercy people will bitch at you to swap off ana these are people with maybe games on ana and have no fucking clue how good she is now they wont say a word if you solo zen but god forbid you pick ana and even if another person picks a lucio theyll still fucking cry i absolutely fucking hate it shes not good on this map omg can we not have a sniper bitch i very rarely even go for an offensive snipe i heal a fuck ton and a tank with my nade on them literally cant die
Overwatch,not_removed,can confirm elims on dva lucio got all the love
Overwatch,not_removed,i wouldnt say support play necessarily is but pretty much any ranged play is overlooked by most teams sleep darts included unless its a flashy ult or a close range hero right next to allies a lot of them overlook what happens id like to think the dva that did this ult noticed at least hopefully id really bet no one else on ally team did quite a few of enemy team probably did though
Overwatch,not_removed,its overlooked in pretty much any game really sort of like when a quarterback gets the majority of credit in an offensive play
Overwatch,not_removed,yes
Overwatch,not_removed,i wish more ana players did this most of the times ive had an ana on my team theyve decided theyre an epic sniper with a toolkit ill find myself on the objective ana right behind me and im at half hp no enemies aroundand she wont heal me just standing there waiting to headshot an enemy not sure they realize ana cant get headshots
Overwatch,not_removed,what do you mean by hitscan when scoped in
Overwatch,not_removed,using the blue triangle to help is not a good idea though because only the small very faint blue triangle ensures a hit youll have your crosshair above your friend at that point anyway while fitting friends inside the more obvious blue triangle wont necessarily mean youll hit
Overwatch,not_removed,it has similar timing to a mei right click actually if you keep that mentality its not too hard to guide a shot for it
Overwatch,not_removed,but when im genji and i get my dragonblade shut down by ana you can bet shes at the top of my shitlist for the rest of the match ill sacrifice a win just to make that players life shit unless its competitive then im just salty like every other competitive player
Overwatch,not_removed,but the dva ult wouldve done jack shit without anas dart goes both ways
Overwatch,not_removed,the dva ult alone would result in zero kills it was the an a play that made it useful
Overwatch,not_removed,sleep dart left click into grenade punch combo is probably my favorite thing in the game
Overwatch,not_removed,pretty decent healing she has the highest hps in the game barring zen ult of course
Overwatch,not_removed,pretty decent healing she has the highest hps in the game barring zen ult of course
Overwatch,not_removed,and yet when we lose i still get told to switch off ana because people dont understand that yet
Overwatch,not_removed,young ana is cute af bro
Overwatch,not_removed,and talk to myself
Overwatch,not_removed,thats amazing thanks for the explanation
Overwatch,not_removed,the dva would of got kills if it werent for ana putting rein to sleep ana should of been potg imo
Overwatch,not_removed,doubtful i rarely get potgs for lucio doing that unless its a triple kill
Overwatch,not_removed,the best is when you hit him just as he rematerializes
Overwatch,not_removed,im just amazed you had an effective ana on your team
Overwatch,not_removed,im eagerly waiting for the ana buff on consoles i plan to actually try and get good with her once it drops
Overwatch,not_removed,last night i popped an ulting genji with nano boost with it he plopped on the payload right next to rein and most of my team and they didnt wake him up was a beautiful thing my team even thanked me
Overwatch,not_removed,i did a game the other day i stopped high noons one whole hog and one death blossom got trashtalked by my team because i picked ana and i was useless i also was first elimobj elim and healing its almost like i am playing hanzo
Overwatch,not_removed,ana managed hit me when i was wall climbing ended up bouncing on the wall for secs
Overwatch,not_removed,how do you do that whenever i hit a sleep dart my team comes along and wakes em up
Overwatch,not_removed,i hit a genji who ulted as well but when he woke up he still had his ult
Overwatch,not_removed,did they change that last time i saw someone talking about her release they said that the sleep dart pauses their ult
Overwatch,not_removed,ive done this too but my teammates immediately woke the genji and then it was all over
Overwatch,not_removed,makes sense though he high noons and hes a big fat slow target if you can dart him you can kill him if you just choose to dart him though he gets right back up and runs away at full speed
Overwatch,not_removed,you got potg for hitting the guy once with an offcenter shot because mcree and the other reaper both softened him up to health
Overwatch,not_removed,also could be running back from spawn through that corridor
Overwatch,not_removed,well sounds like story is confirmed
Overwatch,not_removed,i cant tell if that was the game i was in who was your reinhardt
Overwatch,not_removed,omg i wish i could vote this up a hundred times edit damn points for appreciating a joke stay free overwatch reddit
Overwatch,not_removed,sleepexe
Overwatch,not_removed,nah it just has a usb attachment
Overwatch,not_removed,it doesnt work on torbjorns turret though for some reason even though you can flashbang torbjorn turrets
Overwatch,not_removed,minus lucio booping which does nothing to exploding mech ive never tried speedboost on it though my favorite stupid interaction is that turrets will pick up health packs and it will refill their health
Overwatch,not_removed,you can also charge zarya shield on a meka as d va is ejecting from it weird stuff
Overwatch,not_removed,interesting figured itd become less player like hurtling through the air well thats neat information
Overwatch,not_removed,not a whole lot of utility to it but if youre a healer and dva is getting popped out of her meka you can heal the meka before it explodes for ult charge works best with ana
Overwatch,not_removed,i think people are more appreciative in that because someone supported they are able to play their favorite dpstank and not support so kinda like a thanks for taking one for the team even if people enjoy the support role people see it that way
Overwatch,not_removed,imo it depends on what other actions were done had this match where a guy playing zenyatta did points of healing and i was the only one who voted for him nearly everyone else voted for the rienhardt who did points of damage blocked i didnt even know the zenyatta player and i was mad for him
Overwatch,not_removed,i think its just people are afraid of the common hearing of supports are underappreciated and also mainly because theyre doing the job most other people on the team dont want to do
Overwatch,not_removed,its not like the votes do anything anyway
Overwatch,not_removed,i see it as a hey thanks for playing tanksupport so i dont have to kind of thing i personally dont give it to mercies unless they get a halfway decent amount of healing like and up
Overwatch,not_removed,i got objective kills as dva on lijiang tower and got vote i even got potg people always upvote the lucio that got environment kills
Overwatch,not_removed,i think that might be a mercy thing or salty supports that actually wanna be a bad tracergenji
Overwatch,not_removed,and the thing about it is that getting that much healing on lucio isnt really that difficult
Overwatch,not_removed,last night playing we need a healer im ana she cant heal unless you have god tier aim proceeds to heal damage in one round fuck off dude
Overwatch,not_removed,well its kinda hard to see that the reinhardt was put to sleep since he gets destroyed almost at the same time
Overwatch,not_removed,nothing feels as good as healing a winston whos on the other side of the map while hoping just he just stays in los xd
Overwatch,not_removed,my biggest issue as ana is people insisting on dancing around obstacles so i cant heal them
Overwatch,not_removed,hitscan means the dart hits instantly no travel time no matter how far the target is
Overwatch,not_removed,just to get rid of any possible confusion when someone says projectile in reference to overwatch they mean that the bullet has travel time from the moment you pull the trigger to the moment it hits the mark is a measurable amount of time when someone says hitscan they mean the opposite of projectile hitscan immediatelys travel to the center of your cross hairs and deal damage the moment you pull the triggerso long as you have an enemy in the site no time between shot and hit so projectiles have to actually travel to their targets hitscan does not have to travel
Overwatch,not_removed,yea the faint triangle is good indicator but its comes to you with practice anyways d
Overwatch,not_removed,but you can spam meis right click while this one cant be missed at all its not hard to hit tanks but if i hit a genji its mostly luck
Overwatch,not_removed,its only effective healing you still need to aim and your teammates have to be in los i might suck too p i have an average of nowadays
Overwatch,not_removed,same with genji but people are still really sceptical about how well you can play someone just introduced to overwatch vs someone whos been there forever
Overwatch,not_removed,but can she bake grandma cookies not at that young age
Overwatch,not_removed,cant speak for other people but i default to team mic chat and i dont use a mic but im always listening sad reality is a lot of people do default to group mics and thus never even hear though never hurts to check into mic despite that often one person will say something and a few others follow up
Overwatch,not_removed,if youre the only one with a mic you need to verify that your teammates are listening in the lobby and become the shot caller for your team
Overwatch,not_removed,potentially at the same time we only see two of the kills the other two could be in the hallway where rein wasnt blocking
Overwatch,not_removed,ive gotten it for a double
Overwatch,not_removed,environmental kills are worth kills so if you get a double knockoff pretty much same as someone else getting a quad kill in the eyes of the potg god
Overwatch,not_removed,bad reapers use wraith form to get into position for a death blossom good reapers use wraith form after death blossom for an easy escape
Overwatch,not_removed,one had the bright idea to come after me while i was hanzo as he appear i just headshot him for free
Overwatch,not_removed,ana can be truly incredibleif played correctly
Overwatch,not_removed,do what im doing and try to get good with her now once the buff drops your play will improve with it
Overwatch,not_removed,i know i hate how she is at the moment i try so hard and have came in clutch for so many people with her and then at the end i dont have a card and my numbers are trash
Overwatch,not_removed,only way not to have a bad time with ana is to play with a friend who knows you dont suck people see ana and immediately assume you cant play its infuriating
Overwatch,not_removed,i was playing a game a few days ago and an ana kept sleeping me and tea bagging me on the way to the payload
Overwatch,not_removed,ha i saw that bug in a mythbusters thing bet that surprised anyone who hadnt seen it before
Overwatch,not_removed,i was quite far away from the main fight thats why i also knew he activated his ult just for me because there wasnt anyone else near me i dont think anyone noticed us
Overwatch,not_removed,yeah i think the sleep dart effect finishes quicker than his ult but it gives you time to get some distance hit him right before he wakes up and another hit right after he wakes up
Overwatch,not_removed,this video seems to be confirming my experience as you can see genjis ult timer still goes down while hes asleep
Overwatch,not_removed,hard af to hit it though biblethump
Overwatch,not_removed,i was disappointed with it as much as anyone else in the game
Overwatch,not_removed,or behind that panel next to reinhardt
Overwatch,not_removed,we had a full team of friends
Overwatch,not_removed,make alts
Overwatch,not_removed,sleepjpgexe
Overwatch,not_removed,roadhogs ult also doesnt push it away
Overwatch,not_removed,lucio cant boop a sentrymode bastion either doesnt mean bastion isnt a player in sentry i think certain effects just flag a player or player equivalent as immovable
Overwatch,not_removed,speedboost doesnt affect dva booster flight speed so i doubt it would affect the mech without a pilot as it only moves via boost anyways its why i play dva instead of winston when theres a lucio on our team because ill inevitably get speed boosted or amped and that throws my jump game off and i just fly off a damn cliff
Overwatch,not_removed,ill take the free thanks lucio is so much fun to play
Overwatch,not_removed,dont they hide you exp if you get five or ten
Overwatch,not_removed,i always aim for the enemy mercy first not because i think that killing the healer is a good tactic of anything i just have a deepseated hatred of mercy mains lucio and zen are cool with me though
Overwatch,not_removed,hes just a bit kwanky
Overwatch,not_removed,ive indirectly caused a lot of rage quits by healing a winston from like away and the enemy has no idea why hes not dying its fucking hilarious
Overwatch,not_removed,i was once playing ana with a friend on i think roadhog and for some reason he couldnt be on voice comms and he kept standing out of my los by like pixels every damn time it was so frustrating
Overwatch,not_removed,honestly the crosshair is the best indicator lol but yeah practice makes perfect
Overwatch,not_removed,oh most definitely of my sleep hits and were talking times it hits someone its pure bloody luck that time was me just doing it to a roadhog snorting his canned weed or a dva shooting at someone else
Overwatch,not_removed,people also dont seem to realize that ana lucio is fucking disgusting his area heals keep everyone decently alive during team fights and he can counter ults with his ult while anas single target burst heals make tanks damn near unkillable
Overwatch,not_removed,my friends and i always have to switch into team voice chat can you default into it sometimes we forget to switch
Overwatch,not_removed,or when someone gets that or man ult potg but right at the end of the clip all the dead bodies stand back up in a golden ray of light whenever that happens i always wonder why mercy didnt get potg for denying the potg
Overwatch,not_removed,i think it picks who gets the potg based primarily off medals then picks that players highlight based off near event timing right before taking a point is prioritised and looks for at lease a kill to show which is why its rarely mercy for example it loves environmentals though we all do everyone wants to see them so at the end of the algorithm thats what we get if the player did good the rest of the match
Overwatch,not_removed,always thought that was stupid not like its so hard to do seeing as there are characters who can quite easily get environmental kills on any bunched up enemies
Overwatch,not_removed,very good reapers dont have to use wraith after death blossom because theyre all dead
Overwatch,not_removed,depends on the situation i like to save wraith for defensive measures but sometimes its beneficial to use it for offense for example my team was coming to the payload and the enemies were porting through a teleporter so i wraithed through them and ulted on the porter its an instant teleporter killer and i took one enemy with me totally worth it to make it and destroy the teleporter
Overwatch,not_removed,weebaygif
Overwatch,not_removed,yeah not really
Overwatch,not_removed,just not on competitive play list please im tired of crappy hanzoana combos sooooo bad
Overwatch,not_removed,she isnt a character to play for cards her strengths are largely utility which are difficult for the card system to measure and acknowledge for example how can an ai truly measure effective use of her sleep dart shes not the best healer or damage dealer theres no card for healing blocked her ult will only pad another teammates stats especially if its used well making it more likely for them to get a card her healing style allows teammates to be spread out and take less damage but the benefits of that cant really be measured basically she has a potentially very useful toolkit thats difficult for the game to acknowledge play her to help your team not your ego
Overwatch,not_removed,sounds like you need to git gud friend
Overwatch,not_removed,thats hilarious
Overwatch,not_removed,sleep dart lasts for seconds if he doesnt get hit that should be enough time to let the genjiult run out
Overwatch,not_removed,not what happened the sleep dart hit right as he was finishing screaming his stuff he was right next to me so it was really a do or die situation we let him sleep for the duration while dealing being attacked from every other angle when he woke up he ulted again
Overwatch,not_removed,on a high noon target
Overwatch,not_removed,or running back from spawn through that corridor
Overwatch,not_removed,ok cool yeah playing with a group of my friends last night and we had a pretty similar match to what happened there
Overwatch,not_removed,reinhardt cant charge it to carry it elsewhere either
Overwatch,not_removed,honestly to me everyone but symetra is fun to play
Overwatch,not_removed,i dont mind not getting commended but i hate getting awful cards i once had a game as pharrah where i kept trying to hit a tracer and missing but apart from that i had a great game with top eliminations top damage etc then the game goes and gives me a card for subcareer average rocket hit accuracy
Overwatch,not_removed,a ranked game gave me healing done all time record for me and made it to didnt get legendary tho
Overwatch,not_removed,no theres no reward for getting votes other than the epiclegendary voiceover
Overwatch,not_removed,why im not sure why you have a hatred of mercy mains is there something some mercy did to you to make you angry at every mercy main
Overwatch,not_removed,i have no hatred of mercies i prefer her myself when it comes time for me to heal but i just get such a rush out of killing mercies while their team fails to protect them theres something so wrong yet so right about it
Overwatch,not_removed,ditto play a lot of support myself but ive thrown games by charging at a mercy due to hate
Overwatch,not_removed,not to mention that anas grenade makes lucios healing that more potent
Overwatch,not_removed,i have team chat set to autojoin and group chat set to on when put into a game youll join it automatically but you will have to join group chat when in the menus manually
Overwatch,not_removed,yeah you can its uhh sec ill go relive the settings optionssound and youll see group voice chat and team voice chat i think by default theyre both actually set to auto join not sure how that works changing group to on and leaving team on auto join makes it default to teams voice chat
Overwatch,not_removed,maybe lots of people just dont own mics as well most laptops come with shoddy ones but most desktops require buying one separately so i dunno the statistics of people that have them or not but there must be at least a moderate chunk that dont have mics then add on people who do simply not enjoy talking as i can also relate to and then people who have family nearby or other reasons to not be able to be loud but yeah at least listening to stuff is good in my books for everyone else well id recommend everyone learning how to default to team chat if they dont actively use group chat and want to hear
Overwatch,not_removed,ive had kill cams where the potg is someone killing on the point with an ulti and then the mercy me comes in and kills them with the pistol and then resurrects all in the background while we watch their body ragdoll on the ground chat at least acknowledged it even if the game didnt at least
Overwatch,not_removed,thats because the potg is actually picking of moments where the hp differential are the highest either you deal tons of damage like you throw someone full hp off the map or you rez junkrat triple killing enemy team that did not get potg might be because they were already all low he is just finishing them off their last tick which might be less than knocking people of the map
Overwatch,not_removed,a very good reaper should be playing against people who are are good enough to not get teamwiped from a death blossom
Overwatch,not_removed,why not
Overwatch,not_removed,well i dont play competitive so dont you worry your pretty little head about it son
Overwatch,not_removed,this is exactly how i feel hardly get a single card with her but constantly get messages from other players thanking me for my ana play at the moment i really feel like i have found a niche i have had a elim game where i didnt feel useful and a elim game where i genuinely felt like my support of rein and dva basically won us the game i love her and genuinely think her only buff needs to be a slight increase in healing for her darts
Overwatch,not_removed,doesnt his ult last seconds it should be enough time for you to get out of range of him but i think he would still have some ult left
Overwatch,not_removed,not when you have no idea where they are when they high noon if you turn to look you are dead almost always best to los
Overwatch,not_removed,or behind that panel next to reinhardt
Overwatch,not_removed,erm since when i like pushing them out of the way when im rein
Overwatch,not_removed,did this change because ive actually charged the ult to get it away from my team a handful of times not a lot maybe or so im genuinely curious if you cant do it anymore im gonna go test it really quick and get back to you
Overwatch,not_removed,
Overwatch,not_removed,yes he can
Overwatch,not_removed,pretty much i dont play genji because i suck ass with him and i dont play symettra because while shes really good shes so boring ill play anybody else though just stand there and wait for people to step through the door to their death
Overwatch,not_removed,she friendzoned him by walking up to him but then healing the reinhardt next to him
Overwatch,not_removed,its the way she so smugly wears that halo and wings and renamed herself mercy and the players that have an attitude to match acting like theyre doing the rest of the team a favor by playing mercy like if mercy is your most played character its because you like playing mercy not because youre the only one that will play support
Overwatch,not_removed,thank you
Overwatch,not_removed,i got potg in this one for knocking someone off the map but they had low health and was just person but im sure the potg code is complex enough everyone is right to a degree p
Overwatch,not_removed,im a very bad reaper then cause no one dies and i also walk away for free i also dont own the game so that might have some play in it
Overwatch,not_removed,because shes weak as fuck it doesnt need an in depth analysis saying someone is extremely powerful if played right is such a cop out and utter bullshit
Overwatch,not_removed,if your ana is getting a card then the rest of your team is really doing something wrong either terrible damage dealers or a terrible second healer
Overwatch,not_removed,well the recent patch increased her clip size and her firing rate effectively boosting her heal rate and dps
Overwatch,not_removed,i think its seconds so it depends how early you hit him
Overwatch,not_removed,oh i meant when i knew where they were id turn and kill them instead of shooting tranq for my achievement
Overwatch,not_removed,or they could be dead
Overwatch,not_removed,i could be wrong
Overwatch,not_removed,i stand corrected
Overwatch,not_removed,i didnt know playing a certain character would make you have a specific attitude
Overwatch,not_removed,so in other words its a problem with you thinking they are entitled rather than any actual problem
Overwatch,not_removed,its weird seeing you outside of ranimeirl
Overwatch,not_removed,what are you doing here
Overwatch,not_removed,shaku what are you doing outside of the cage youre supposed to write shitposts on the sub or read porn why are you doing neither
Overwatch,not_removed,you too huh i just watch the potgs and sigh
Overwatch,not_removed,because shes weak as fuck it doesnt need an in depth analysis saying someone is extremely powerful if played right is such a cop out and utter bullshit saying someone is weak as fuck it doesnt need an in depth analysis is such a cop out and utter bullshit
Overwatch,not_removed,true to be fair just like anyone else i would be happy with a buff with my main just to make my life easier but the increase in fire rate has made a huge difference in reality i think she is great where she is and coupled up with a lucio i think she is a game winner
Overwatch,not_removed,i looked it up it is seconds so with the sheet animation and a gap closing he should have at max second left if he sleep for the full duration
Overwatch,not_removed,or behind the hall next to the panel
Overwatch,not_removed,its just a prevalent attitude i see i know my racism isnt based on data or rational thought but it lets me enjoy the game more
Overwatch,not_removed,well yeah i never claimed that my attitude was rational
Overwatch,not_removed,please dont tell the other mods they dont know that im out of the cage
Overwatch,not_removed,its how i felt when i saw himherit in destinythegame
Overwatch,not_removed,watching cool potg in envy
Overwatch,not_removed,she doesnt even go here
Overwatch,not_removed,living vicariously through us probably
Overwatch,not_removed,goddamnit who told you
Overwatch,not_removed,why dude just get the game
Overwatch,not_removed,thats a good attitude
Overwatch,not_removed,they could be falling off a ledge after being shot by dva
Overwatch,not_removed,why not both
Overwatch,not_removed,i like playing mercy so i dont see how others act playing mercy i will on occasion call my team a bad team if i cant stay alive to support them or if they all break up and the only person i can get los on is the reinhardt or the ana seriously why did this guy pick rein if you all are just going to leave him at the payload with mercy and run off to flank from different directions one at a time edit in that game rein was the only one of our team to get a card nobody voted for him so he called us a bunch of cunts and left before anyone could respond i voted for the enemy roadhog who got gold medals
Overwatch,not_removed,someone said i need to pick up a little shitposter that escaped up in here
Overwatch,not_removed,im going to tell the mods i actually didnt know who they are though
Overwatch,not_removed,itll be our little secret shhhh
Overwatch,not_removed,
Overwatch,not_removed,i dont know who i am either
Overwatch,not_removed,i feel so bad for seagull the handshake bait from malik was too strong honestly think i would have done the same thing
Overwatch,not_removed,so wheres the video d
Overwatch,not_removed,jimmy fallon is the seagull handshake of late night tv
Overwatch,not_removed,just loaded up reddit to see if someone beat me to it definitely a cringe worthy moment to be shared on national tv
Overwatch,not_removed,tbh i dont see why its such a huge deal the interviewer held his hand a long time there and it wasnt even so awkward because seagull actually went through with it instead of just leaving it hanging if you want to see an awkward esports handshake ptr had it way worse
Overwatch,not_removed,they barely finished clapping lol
Overwatch,not_removed,brandon is such a great guy i hope he laughs at it and spins it into more success play jimmy in a v
Overwatch,not_removed,gamers have a dark history with personal interaction on live tv
Overwatch,not_removed,rip
Overwatch,not_removed,seagull was on jimmy fallon
Overwatch,not_removed,we mainstream now playerbase of million
Overwatch,not_removed,videos in this thread videocomment ptr who now plays for nrgs csgo team handshake for reference gamers have a dark history with handshakes as well im guessing this is what we are talking about uhh that was jimmy kimmel watch this instead trust me o h y e s heres the owner of clg they have the best handshakes and here is seangares formerly of csgo parodying ptr eternalenvy king of awkward im a bot working hard to help redditors find related videos to watch httpsnpredditcomrsubtletvwikimentionedvideos get it on httpschromegooglecomwebstoredetailmentionedvideosforreddfiimkmdalmgffhibfdjnhljpnigcmohf httpsaddonsmozillaorgenusfirefoxaddonmentionedvideosforreddit
Overwatch,not_removed,the only thing jimmy fallon should host is a parasite
Overwatch,not_removed,im guessing this is what we are talking about
Overwatch,not_removed,always shake with your right hand in the professional world at least
Overwatch,not_removed,ows been vital everytime something giddy happens we on the front page giddy giddy
Overwatch,not_removed,i hate jimmy fallon but i love awkward moments
Overwatch,not_removed,this is amazing
Overwatch,not_removed,so cheap
Overwatch,not_removed,malik i just rekt seagull
Overwatch,not_removed,here it is bois
Overwatch,not_removed,overwatch is already mainstream lol
Overwatch,not_removed,so embarrassed for him
Overwatch,not_removed,must have been a slow day
Overwatch,not_removed,so this is how the altright must feel when they get featured on the news
Overwatch,not_removed,can someone do a ama with seagull so we can get a reaction out of him d hahahah this made my day ty op
Overwatch,not_removed,still no video im disappoint
Overwatch,not_removed,this show is so awful
Overwatch,not_removed,the real cringe is that noodle arm
Overwatch,not_removed,lol i feel so bad for seagull hes probably laughing about it as much as we are but idk if i could handle my social slipup being blasted on social mediatv poor guy ´﹏；
Overwatch,not_removed,my bad i get american hosts confused
Overwatch,not_removed,link
Overwatch,not_removed,dont mind me im just commenting to come back later to watch the video
Overwatch,not_removed,overwatch can suck a fat dong fuck you
Overwatch,not_removed,well it was the left hand but yeah bait was strong
Overwatch,not_removed,i dont think id ever go for a left handshake it wasnt a bait at all
Overwatch,not_removed,interviewers never shake the hand of the person they are interviewing though maybe after the interview when the camera is off as a thanks for the interview but not during the interview thats madness
Overwatch,not_removed,
Overwatch,not_removed,trust me
Overwatch,not_removed,he looks at the lake
Overwatch,not_removed,god damn thats accurate at least the seagull handshake was surrounded by two decently entertaining people though all fallon has is questlove
Overwatch,not_removed,idk man i would love the opportunity to just play charades plinko password pyramid pictionary catchphrase and other great party games with some of my favorite celebrities and highprofile friends to get paid millions of dollars for it as well doesnt sound that lame to me
Overwatch,not_removed,
Overwatch,not_removed,yeah i actually felt it looked like seagul was even maybe just a little pissed off more than anything httpimgurcomafjads just seemed stupid all round rather than awkward or embarrassing
Overwatch,not_removed,the one with krimz was pretty awkward too p
Overwatch,not_removed,i dunno his lunge forward to actually seize the hand after it was withdrawn was kind of the worst thing about it totally the other guys fault for leaving it hanging there like bait for so long
Overwatch,not_removed,if you want awkward esports stuff just looks up on the smash scene guys cool and and is an amazing player but damn hes awkward as hell
Overwatch,not_removed,eternalenvy king of awkward
Overwatch,not_removed,but karma
Overwatch,not_removed,gamers have a dark history with handshakes as well
Overwatch,not_removed,i look at the stars
Overwatch,not_removed,why do american hosts act out the joke after they already made it a few times in ths case him reinacting the handshake annoys me so much
Overwatch,not_removed,jimmy fallon is the parasite leeching off of funny moments such as this to make them laugh
Overwatch,not_removed,this is probably a retarded question but what if you were lefthanded
Overwatch,not_removed,viral ftfy
Overwatch,not_removed,hes an absolute tool
Overwatch,not_removed,he posted on his twitter
Overwatch,not_removed,uhh that was jimmy kimmel
Overwatch,not_removed,i know jimmy kimmel said some stupid stuff about the gaming community on youtube but ive never really heard that stuff from fallon then again i just sometimes watch his videos for the live game shows with celebrities
Overwatch,not_removed,that was jimmy kimmel lmao i dont think jimmy fallon would ever say that considering he has a segment dedicated to games dont know if he still does
Overwatch,not_removed,theres a little thing called save use it
Overwatch,not_removed,same remind me on hrs
Overwatch,not_removed,didnt he have a mic on the right hand if im holding something with my right hand and i have to shake hands i usually hand out the left one and the other person uses their left hand and nothing special hapens no reaction from them or confussion or anything
Overwatch,not_removed,whats left hand have to do with anything
Overwatch,not_removed,maybe hes left handed and was super excited to be given the left handed shake hes always dreamed of
Overwatch,not_removed,
Overwatch,not_removed,hey look at this nerd overenthusiastic laughter
Overwatch,not_removed,in gaming views since sep httpwwwredditcomryoutubefactsbotwikiindex
Overwatch,not_removed,i trusted you was not disappointed
Overwatch,not_removed,remindme hours
Overwatch,not_removed,can you get a video and send the link plz
Overwatch,not_removed,surrounded by two decently entertaining people dude you just described fallon perfectly one channel up is jimmy kimmel and one channel down is stephen colbert
Overwatch,not_removed,im not saying his job is lame im saying compared to other hosts he is quite lame
Overwatch,not_removed,what makes it more awkward is how ptr is so uncomfortable in that situation seagull played it like a champ
Overwatch,not_removed,httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvlchcilrirhw they have the best handshakes
Overwatch,not_removed,and is seangares formerly of csgo parodying ptr
Overwatch,not_removed,dude the krimz one had me dead literally light headed i was laughing so hard
Overwatch,not_removed,in slow motionzoomed in it symbolizes one mans determination to heal the racial divide in america regardless of judgement or social consequences
Overwatch,not_removed,that wasnt too bad atleast the interviewer noticed it and didnt make a thing out of it
Overwatch,not_removed,they should invite to host all gamer interviews
Overwatch,not_removed,this hurts my soul
Overwatch,not_removed,why do people even go for handshakes you have nothing to gain and everything to lose
Overwatch,not_removed,and champagne bottles
Overwatch,not_removed,didnt think i was the type but i got so much second hand embarrassment from this
Overwatch,not_removed,it would of been completely fine if they both laughed abit at it but no lets pretend it didnt happen instead wouldnt want to make it akward by acknowledging it
Overwatch,not_removed,whats wrong with the one after is more trolling than awkward tbh half of these dont deserve to be in a video
Overwatch,not_removed,but that was seagull seagull on jimmy fallon confirmed might be an arg to sombra
Overwatch,not_removed,because people like fallon like to prey on other people who make tiny mistakes for the mainstream media
Overwatch,not_removed,he can host my parasite
Overwatch,not_removed,deleted
Overwatch,not_removed,but overwatch is vital
Overwatch,not_removed,just curious why i havent seen him that much but he seems like a pretty benign personality
Overwatch,not_removed,theres nothing wrong with him its ok not to hate things you know
Overwatch,not_removed,a lot funnier than you it seems
Overwatch,not_removed,fuck
Overwatch,not_removed,thats a questionable analogy because im not in the nba if i was in the nba i would go play basketball i definitely would well i would play league of legends but im not in the lcs if i was in the lcs i would go play league of legends i definitely would btw you can go grab a basketball and just play you idiot not to mention using youtube comments as a basis on anything for anyone curious
Overwatch,not_removed,how does one save on mobile
Overwatch,not_removed,if im holding something with my right hand i switch it to left of the time to shake hands having said that i dont blame seagull because he had no choice if he going for the leftie handshake and seagull doesnt respond it also looks bad malik just has to control his hand gestures better
Overwatch,not_removed,he switched his mic from the left to the right hand right before extending the left hand so it really felt as if he was switching the mic over to the other hand to clear his hand for a handshake even if it was the wrong hand and he really had no intention to shake his hand then
Overwatch,not_removed,dude what everyone knows you hold things like beers with your left hand so youre always ready to shake with the right and it wont be wet from the bottle
Overwatch,not_removed,hang on what why do you use your right hand to hold things its for shaking
Overwatch,not_removed,really ive never seen anyone even attempt to shake with their left and id imagine it would feel awkward doing so
Overwatch,not_removed,most people are righthanded and therefore shake with their right hands in ancient times it was considered extremely rude to shake with your left hand because thats the hand used for wiping your ass also only demons were thought to be lefthanded
Overwatch,not_removed,i think if the moderator knew he was left handed we would too even lefties never go for a left handshake o but he was probably just very excited its okay in the end
Overwatch,not_removed,what why
Overwatch,not_removed,leave to to fallon to make what could have been something hilarious something thats justheh
Overwatch,not_removed,its already up sending this cause you dont have to wait hours
Overwatch,not_removed,i will be messaging you on utc to local time to remind you of hours to send a pm to also be reminded and to reduce spam parent commenter can httpnpredditcommessagecomposetoremindmebotsubjectdelete commentmessagedelete dont forget to add the time options after the of
Overwatch,not_removed,they are not your secretary you know since its just happened there is a chance that its going to pop up on fallons youtube channel later just need to wait a lil bit
Overwatch,not_removed,he needed to be the first to post about itwho cares about sources man
Overwatch,not_removed,i think thats dependent on your cable package but thats a neat coincidence
Overwatch,not_removed,kimmel is just as lame imo now colbert thats where its at
Overwatch,not_removed,problem is kimmel is worse
Overwatch,not_removed,idk i feel like he fills his niche quite well his show is goofy and a far cry from the original tonight show and every version before his but i dont think i could see one of the other current late night hosts doing the job he does
Overwatch,not_removed,that was actually a dick move and he made him look like a fool hahaha
Overwatch,not_removed,holy shit that was pro
Overwatch,not_removed,its a reflex
Overwatch,not_removed,seagull on jimmy fallon is characters
Overwatch,not_removed,im not like a fallon apologist but jimmy has made a living off of being completely useless when it comes to holding character and allowing guests to come on live television and tell embarrassing stories about him for all to see the nicole kidman story is a great one to reference for this he had a chance to bag her because she had a crush on him and he was a complete lame when he was practically set up with her by his friend he brought her to his apartment and everything and jimmy was playing video games and offering her leftover chinese food thats not even remotely relatable for anyone on this sub or are we all just suddenly above making references to funny things and gaining popularity on a social platform for repeating the things weve heard and read
Overwatch,not_removed,hey man at least supply the microscope
Overwatch,not_removed,that maybe true but viral seemed to make more sense in that context
Overwatch,not_removed,some think hes fake when hes just a bubbly dude in his comedians in cars episode seinfeld seems to sum up his persona perfectly oh and thats jimmy hes just happy to be here paraphrasing
Overwatch,not_removed,now i dont know this guy at all but bringing up this tiny moment doesnt seem benign at all
Overwatch,not_removed,he leeches off of shit happening to get free laughs people werent laughing at fallons movements it was the video
Overwatch,not_removed,well this is an odd response do you know me for your information i dont hate everything i often like and occasionally love things i just happen to think that jimmy fallon is an absolute tool
Overwatch,not_removed,unlike fallon he didnt try to be funny
Overwatch,not_removed,its really faint with subreddit style on but zoom in and you will see it
Overwatch,not_removed,samebut its usually a drink or something then my right hand is all wet but ive already switched hands so my left is now all wet too which leads to the awkward palm wipe on the thigh move which doesnt really dry anything
Overwatch,not_removed,wait what i am righthanded and use my right hand to wipe my ass is something wrong with me
Overwatch,not_removed,ahh yes this brings me back to my childhood my uncle asked me as a kid if you go to heaven what hand will you shake jesus hand with i honestly did not know how to answer and was like does it matter lol people be crazy d
Overwatch,not_removed,so im a demon sweet
Overwatch,not_removed,i always heard it was because your right hand was the one youd probably use to impale them with a spear so if you use your right hand to shake its a way of disarming yourself and showing trust
Overwatch,not_removed,if youre right handed you mainly use your right hand hence the term you dont randomly change just to wipe your ass
Overwatch,not_removed,its actually to do with swords most people would hold a sword in their right hand by shaking hands you were showing you didnt have your sword drawn im not sure what the actual shaking motion is for
Overwatch,not_removed,it also has some background from medieval times shaking with your dominant hand made it harder to stab the guy whose hand you are shaking which is a rather nice quality for a gesture of agreement during a time where everyone carried swords of course lefthanded people would not be handicapped by this so they were considered treacherous
Overwatch,not_removed,i dont see how that matters left handed people arent that rare as to assume someone using their left hand is shaking realizing that its the wrong hand is only about as likely as realizing this wasnt a hand shake at all regardless of hand ive heard the whole left handed demons thing before as well if someone stuck out their left hand to shake i wouldnt think anything of it except maybe theyre left handed i doubt seagull did either also what wipe with your left hand who does that do you wipe with your non dominant hand i sure dont i dont see why anyone would ive never heard anything about left hand wiping and id bet anything most people dont follow whatever that is or have heard about it the only thing with any weight at all is that most people are right handed but that also has absolutely nothing to do with the possibility any given person isnt
Overwatch,not_removed,while yes most people are right handed would you really assume anything except that someones left handed if they extended their left hand according to google its around a in chance that any handshake might be left handed not that small
Overwatch,not_removed,literally all they had to do was give a slow mo replay with play by play commentary and it would have been hilarious harbleu did that on stream and it was great
Overwatch,not_removed,god that guy pisses me off
Overwatch,not_removed,i am looking at the lake
Overwatch,not_removed,sure hes decently entertaining
Overwatch,not_removed,if someone offers maybe but why initiate
Overwatch,not_removed,seagull on jimmy fallon is also a kinky ship
Overwatch,not_removed,i just would rather his comedic delivery be more subtle
Overwatch,not_removed,ik
Overwatch,not_removed,yes but its vital
Overwatch,not_removed,yeah i i meant reddit viral
Overwatch,not_removed,you literally just described like or more of the most successful reddit comments making a reference to something you saw read or heard and getting free laughs and internet brownie points for being the one who said it first as a response except hes getting paid millions of dollars to do what we all do for free what a loser
Overwatch,not_removed,just remarking on the fact that most of the time people hate on things because its popularcool to do so ie me expressing that jimmy fallon has nothing wrong with him above and therefore downvoted you seemed to have strong feelings towards a tv personality and perpetuating that hate thats all i meant
Overwatch,not_removed,you wiped with your left because you were right handed and ategreeted with your right the only toilet paper was a hand back then
Overwatch,not_removed,it mattered more when they had to use their hand as toilet paper and didnt have the proper facilities to wash their hands these days you just use whats handy heh
Overwatch,not_removed,hygiene has come a long way
Overwatch,not_removed,yes
Overwatch,not_removed,no you just dont adhere to ancient hebrew traditions like a normal modern person p
Overwatch,not_removed,old crazy traditions be old and crazy p
Overwatch,not_removed,yeah i mentioned the sword aspect of it in another response a story in the old testament bible had a guy assassinate someone because no one bothered to check if he hid his sword for lefthanded wielders
Overwatch,not_removed,during a time where everyone carried swords not everyone carried swords in ye olde times actually outside the almost nobody did they were too impractical too expensive too difficult to maintain and not functional a sword really only has one use most swords that werent owned by the nobility were family heirlooms passed down from generation to generation only worn on special occasions or during battle swords back then were like hmmm a really highend sports car today but everybody had a knife thats what they were worried about much easier to be stabby with a knife than a sword
Overwatch,not_removed,also what wipe with your left hand who does that im thinking you missed the part where i started my sentence with in ancient times its not something people do now but its part of the reason why things are the way they are back in the day they didnt have toilet paper sooooo if you want to know more just pick up a bible and flip through the old testament it was kind of a big thing back then i dont remember exactly what story it was but something about a guy was able to assassinate someone because he was lefthanded and hid his sword under his cloak on that side and the guards only checked for a sword where he wouldve put it if he was righthanded the asswiping part was just further explanation of daily life
Overwatch,not_removed,its considered rude in some cultures to this day for the reason of you use your left hand to do dirty things
Overwatch,not_removed,im right handed and wipe with my left i had my right arm in a cast for a few months after a motorbike accident so now out of habit i do most personal things with my left hand
Overwatch,not_removed,left handed people represent iirc so pretty rare actually
Overwatch,not_removed,you should raskhistorians
Overwatch,not_removed,not even lefthanded people shake with their left hand its just not something thats done
Overwatch,not_removed,are you ned flanders
Overwatch,not_removed,because they think the opposite part is offering also this looked weird in my inbox
Overwatch,not_removed,oh yes
Overwatch,not_removed,so ive been told
Overwatch,not_removed,except hes getting paid millions of dollars to do what we all do for free what a loser took the words right out of my mouth
Overwatch,not_removed,yep thought someone would have a problem with that statement to elaborate everyone rich and important enough that getting stabbed during a handshake was something you needed to worry about
Overwatch,not_removed,damn bro you had me all geared up for some sort of biblical pooassassin pshhh
Overwatch,not_removed,i didnt say it was modern times i said it wasnt relevant if its something thats completely died down now why would it matter all your arguments against left handed shakes rely on things that the average person doesnt know and doesnt consider even a tiny bit it doesnt matter in modern times people dont have any of these reasons they will still assume someone is right handed as well typically but not the point of thinking something is up if they arent honestly
Overwatch,not_removed,likewise busted up my right hand for or so now i can only jerk of with my lefty
Overwatch,not_removed,fair enough my condolences for the arm though thats also pretty outside the norm right
Overwatch,not_removed,
Overwatch,not_removed,no way i mean my own sample size of people ive met is a lot bigger than but thats probably just lucky no way a good of people i know are left handed when the actual percentage is especially when google disagrees and said it was around
Overwatch,not_removed,while not all do some left handed people still do that and i really dont understand whats wrong with doing it we dont wipe our ass with our hands anymore
Overwatch,not_removed,speak for yourself ive received and given left hand shakes certainly some lefties wouldnt because they know its less common but you cant speak for everyone like that because it is something thats done the fact ive received multiple left hand shakes and thought nothing about it except theyre left handed is the whole damn reason im making such an argument here seagull clearly thought the exact same thing
Overwatch,not_removed,
Overwatch,not_removed,i suspect not again a dagger only has purpose a proper knife on the other hand has multiple from self defence to making food to eating it
Overwatch,not_removed,judges enjoy its one of my favorites
Overwatch,not_removed,poosassin
Overwatch,not_removed,i didnt say it was modern times i said it wasnt relevant thing is it is relevant like i said its not something people do now its part of why people do things even today a lot of things we do in modern life have no basis in what were actually doing anymore whether its colloquial speech or hand gestures we cling to things long since past
Overwatch,not_removed,risky click of the day
Overwatch,not_removed,but thats the thing people dont do things based around this like you claim some things do affect what people do without knowing the reason why this is not one such case though
Overwatch,not_removed,yesterday i linked to a video of a sexbot fucking a japanese woman if you want a really risky click its risky because you know its bad but you dont know exactly how bad it is
Overwatch,not_removed,i can imagine
Overwatch,not_removed,i doubt you really do ͡o ͜ʖ ͡o

Overwatch,not_removed,ᕦòóˇᕤ just ╭òóˇ╮do it

Overwatch,not_removed,if this gif has bad quality refer to this and turn up the quality to
Overwatch,not_removed,if zarya has bubble on her or a teammate i believe emp only takes the bubble and nothing else its like if diva ult would kill someone but zarya bubbles them it just takes bubble

Overwatch,not_removed,dva and roadhog are in the wrong spots literally unuseable

Overwatch,not_removed,thank you this is friggen awesome
Overwatch,not_removed,we should really upvote this so that new comers now where to download it
Overwatch,not_removed,apparently it doesnt support windows sigh
Overwatch,not_removed,i assume its not compatible with windows then my rainmeter is up to date but i get an error saying the version of windows isnt supported
Overwatch,not_removed,okay i think im an idiot but how do i change the battlenetsteam etc links i click them and they dont do anything
Overwatch,not_removed,i was making this too but im hoping to incorporate animated backgrounds and custom icons already got a test soldier animated wallpaper to work
Overwatch,not_removed,this has probably been asked before but when i click the buttons battlenet spotify etc it opens up my drive and not the app it should be opening how would i go around so when i click battlenet it opens battlenet

Overwatch,not_removed,try right clic on the background settings position on the desktop
Overwatch,not_removed,when you loaded it in the rainmeter you got options on the right put it on desktop instead of normal or on top
Overwatch,not_removed,thank you im really glad that you love my work
Overwatch,not_removed,oh im so sorry i didnt recognise you thank you so much for your amazing work i could do nothing without it also some people already want me to update the skin with ana and as i said i cant do nothing without your work so will you make an ana one
Overwatch,not_removed,you can do this by adding a new tool bar to your task bar right clic and place it leftor right to your programs icons
Overwatch,not_removed,it was pretty harsh but ive replaced all the skins positions and scales by variables depending of the scale of your screen just download it again and it will erase the old one
Overwatch,not_removed,there she is
Overwatch,not_removed,asking the real questions here d wanna know too
Overwatch,not_removed,
Overwatch,not_removed,make a folder with shortcuts to the programs you want pinned unlock taskbar rightclick taskbar select toolbarsnew toolbar select your new folder to show icons only rightclick the toolbar you just added select viewlarge icons also uncheck show text and show title it should look something like this in the end httpimgurcomoiouxhs
Overwatch,not_removed,maybe some kind of taskbar replacement
Overwatch,not_removed,the locations and the names of your apps have to be linked in the buttonsvariablesinc file in the resources folder
Overwatch,not_removed,you can edit it that in the location the skin is in there will be an int file if you open that and scroll through you can see the sources of the applications and change certain paths
Overwatch,not_removed,it doesnt the latest update on rainmeter still supports windows but not all features and it doesnt with the skin sorry man
Overwatch,not_removed,please let me know if this work so ill add it to the description
Overwatch,not_removed,the locations and the names of your apps have to be linked in the buttonsvariablesinc file in the resources folder
Overwatch,not_removed,in the location of the file there should be a int file it could be that it is hidden
Overwatch,not_removed,it is it supports windows as well
Overwatch,not_removed,its now fixed
Overwatch,not_removed,sort the comments by old its on the first one
Overwatch,not_removed,sort the comments by old its on the first one

Overwatch,not_removed,sort the comments by old its on the first one
Overwatch,not_removed,the locations and the names of your apps have to be linked in the buttonsvariablesinc file in the resources folder
Overwatch,not_removed,haha i didnt thought about that but you can invert the text and the popup if that doesnt suits you
Overwatch,not_removed,change the resolutions in the containing folder where you find a int file there if you scroll through you find resolutions
Overwatch,not_removed,it was pretty harsh but ive replaced all the skins positions and scales by variables depending of the scale of your screen just download it again and it will erase the old one
Overwatch,not_removed,you can go in the ini files and remove all the tooltips or use a text editor to replace all tooltiptexts with tooltiptext
Overwatch,not_removed,try to put some like cprogram
Overwatch,not_removed,it was pretty harsh but ive replaced all the skins positions and scales by variables depending of the scale of your screen just download it again and it will erase the old one
Overwatch,not_removed,you cant just comment to me and not scroll through the comments
Overwatch,not_removed,it was pretty harsh but ive replaced all the skins positions and scales by variables depending of the scale of your screen just download it again and it will erase the old one
Overwatch,not_removed,change your shortcuts in buttonsvariablesinc in the resources folder
Overwatch,not_removed,uuh do i even have to say it
Overwatch,not_removed,if you open rainmeter and go to the skinfolder when its loaded on the right you can see the place for the monitor it most likely says automaticly choose your main monitor instead
Overwatch,not_removed,try this one and tell me what you got with the wallpapers are so if youre at the same or smaller it will work otherwise youll have to edit the wallpapers by yourself sorry
Overwatch,not_removed,very strange indeed for battle ive got cprogram files launcherexe but for steam ive got exactly the same and it work i suppose you tried to quit and relaunch rainmeter
Overwatch,not_removed,i used your exact links and then saved immediately after saving i restarted my pc and they all worked
Overwatch,not_removed,i am working on it
Overwatch,not_removed,
Overwatch,not_removed,sure youll only have to edit the buttonsvariablesinc file in the resources folder
Overwatch,not_removed,there she is
Overwatch,not_removed,there she is
Overwatch,not_removed,there she is
Overwatch,not_removed,there she is
Overwatch,not_removed,i do warn you it takes away a ton of ram and if you are on laptop a ton of battery
Overwatch,not_removed,fun fact reddit has a handydandy save button located right next to the share button on submissions and the embed button on comments this eliminates the need to try and look back through your old comments to find something and allows you to look through a smaller list of things that you really enjoyed
Overwatch,not_removed,i will be messaging you on utc to local time to remind you of minutes to send a pm to also be reminded and to reduce spam parent commenter can httpnpredditcommessagecomposetoremindmebotsubjectdelete commentmessagedelete dont forget to add the time options after the of
Overwatch,not_removed,uh
Overwatch,not_removed,reddit has a save feature that lets you save posts and comments helps keep the clutter in a thread down
Overwatch,not_removed,in this case its because the artist is french and each section is alphabetized and in a few localizations roadhogs name is chopper so its before dva its why mercy is before lucio here too because shes just angel in some languages lol
Overwatch,not_removed,heres a basic tutorial for using rainmeter from rrainmeter but for a skin and layout package like this its simple as installing rainmeter as hitting download in the top right side of the deviantart page then running that file
Overwatch,not_removed,thats because one of the background layers isnt trimmed to fit the taskbar as it is not the wallpaper simply an image being displayed to fix this figure out what layer it is that is giving you trouble go into photoshop or some other image editor and cut the bottom of the image to make enough space for the taskbar make sure that the part you cut is transparent and save the image as a png now if you refresh or shouldnt hide the taskbar anymore note that this only works if the taskbar is in the bottom and not the sides of the window
Overwatch,not_removed,check the properties of your taskbar it probably is on autohide or unlocked
Overwatch,not_removed,yeah its a frequent glitch with rainmeter that pisses me off too
Overwatch,not_removed,what i did is set the background image to click through right click settings click through this disables the option to actually right click the image to change properties and such but it works for me
Overwatch,not_removed,its because the position of each background defaults as on desktop so its like a regular window which can cover the task bar if you manage the skin you can set it to bottom but that lasts only until another character background is reloaded i believe i fixed it by editing every background file to add under variables im no rainmeter expert so there may be a more efficient or effective way to do this this just seems to have worked for me
Overwatch,not_removed,i wish people did tbh i get the same questions a lot
Overwatch,not_removed,please let me know is this work ill add it to the description then
Overwatch,not_removed,please let me know if this work so ill add it to the description
Overwatch,not_removed,same issue sad because this seems like an awesome skin
Overwatch,not_removed,nope sorry it doesnt
Overwatch,not_removed,yeah the location must have been different from standard as ive explained many times if you open the containing folder and and check the sources and find an int files you can change the locations and names
Overwatch,not_removed,oh shit whaddup
Overwatch,not_removed,ready to comply
Overwatch,not_removed,in french too edit although reaper is called faucheur in french and reaper in op so its unlikely
Overwatch,not_removed,they named tracer void hunter in chinese and everyone knew the name was shit so from day everyone has called her flash of light
Overwatch,not_removed,reaper faucheur im ok thats the litteral translation but roadhod choppeur wtf mercy ange another approximate translation
Overwatch,not_removed,oh ew those are bad being a french canadian myself i grew up with english versions of video games and i still remember years old me being shocked french people translated pokemon names
Overwatch,not_removed,vodka vodka vodka putin putin putin idi nahui blyat bylat blyat csgo in a nutshell
Overwatch,not_removed,keep it on mei wallpaper and youll have a tropical storm
Overwatch,not_removed,is that not what rain is
Overwatch,not_removed,how do they work
Overwatch,not_removed,thats a shitton of rain
Overwatch,not_removed,i have a question how do i edit the links given here spotify steam etc
Overwatch,not_removed,haha thank you dude now i have not much time but eventually i will add ana to the collection for sure just look at the album httpimgurcomapprgk these days maybe for this weekend d
Overwatch,not_removed,i think shes asking about the open programs not just the icons and i actually have the same question d see i have a taskbar for google chrome but when i open google chrome i still get the open program tab on the left of my taskbar like this
Overwatch,not_removed,i still dont understand how to do it whenever i add a new toolbar it just adds words and a link to the folder
Overwatch,not_removed,youre my hero
Overwatch,not_removed,thank you
Overwatch,not_removed,so is this incorrect
Overwatch,not_removed,some of the weapon icons will appear twice when i use the skin how do you fix this p screenshot one of many
Overwatch,not_removed,im confused about this would you be able to record your screen and show it please big help if you did d
Overwatch,not_removed,no worries great looking skin regardless
Overwatch,not_removed,it partially worked the visuals for each character shows up but it doesnt fit all of the characters to screen it lets me choose between each character but doesnt let me click on their ability icons to open the indicated programs steam spotify etc
Overwatch,not_removed,thank you so much
Overwatch,not_removed,thank you so much d
Overwatch,not_removed,i found this file but what do i do once im in say i want to link one if the buttons to steam how do i do this new to rainmeter sorry
Overwatch,not_removed,thankyou very much kind sir
Overwatch,not_removed,can you be more specific
Overwatch,not_removed,thanks
Overwatch,not_removed,thank you it looks much much better i appreciate it though now all the buttons just open my drive im looking to see if i can fix that but i know just about nothing about this if i figure it out ill comment again
Overwatch,not_removed,holy cow you rock many thanks
Overwatch,not_removed,thanks man i appreciate it love your work youve done here
Overwatch,not_removed,this is my resources folder what to do now
Overwatch,not_removed,gotcha chief pc will definitely be my next purchase
Overwatch,not_removed,thank you it worked except for the placement and size of the portrait but i suppose its an easy fix this is the resulthttpimgurcomzoxsouq
Overwatch,not_removed,oh shit i only have thinking of upgrading once i get paid though do you think ill be fine for now or would you recommend waiting
Overwatch,not_removed,how much are we talking
Overwatch,not_removed,i was only seeing it use but that was just sitting there looking pretty not mousing over anything
Overwatch,not_removed,oh nice ty
Overwatch,not_removed,thanks man didnt know about that
Overwatch,not_removed,oh youre right its the french order here
Overwatch,not_removed,is there a reason why the names are different
Overwatch,not_removed,yeah exactly this its created in such a way that if you download it through deviantart and then openload the files on rainmeter it will do it by himself minor problems that mostly occur not the right resolutions icons not on the right spot
Overwatch,not_removed,how does this stuff work if you have a dual monitor set up is the second monitor empty or does it mimic the main display
Overwatch,not_removed,you rock thank you doing this as soon as i get home
Overwatch,not_removed,its locked and dont autohide
Overwatch,not_removed,your version of windows is not supported by this package am i doing this right
Overwatch,not_removed,
Overwatch,not_removed,wow it does work thanks a lot
Overwatch,not_removed,this works for my windows machine thanks so much edit i spoke too soon it loads but the buttons dont work and it autohides my task bar and the only way to bring it back is to switch characters hopefully these are just setting tweaks on my end still great work edit just had to edit the paths and set the backgrounds to click through works perfectly now
Overwatch,not_removed,ive made a version here
Overwatch,not_removed,oh sorry i looked at the other responses in this thread line and didnt see it thats why i asked
Overwatch,not_removed,soldat is soldier in german too
Overwatch,not_removed,is that a fancy way of spelling fucker
Overwatch,not_removed,its just a supposition but chopper is a familiar word in france for catch so choppeur someone who catch others in reference of his hook
Overwatch,not_removed,well mercy in french would translate to pitié which would be a hilarious nod to andrés dog in caméra café
Overwatch,not_removed,well most countries have their own translation for pokémon names i think they did a great at it i usually prefer things in vo if said vo is english but when its not the translation and dubbing is often better than the english version the witcher is a good example the english version is quite shallow in comparison to the french one its a language thats naturally rich in slang words and crude colourful expressions which in my opinion works wonders with this universe just listening to thalers talar uninterrupted flow of slurs in french makes me crack up every single time
Overwatch,not_removed,hmmm i wouldnt say that i mean most of the french are not great at foreign languages our english lessons at school are pretty poor and the methods are so old to teach it that a good chunk of our population is bad at it but other than that we have no hard feelings toward english in fact we use a lot of english words pretty much everyone i know calls a pc a pc its just that sometimes we use the word ordi because why not we have two words for it so we juggle between them same goes for a lot of english words that are now rooted in our day to day language we are not like the frenchspeaking canadians who go as far as translating movie names and therefore making a lot of them terrible sounding weird ridiculous well we do translate some of them but partially for example the star wars franchise keeps its name in french but the episode title is translated in canada they translate the whole thing if i remember well its just that our people that are bad at speaking english even though its getting a bit better with the younger generations its not the century anymore we dont really mind english words a lot of people working in offices use english words all the time its kind of a national joke to laugh at these guys working in parisian headquarters of international firms speaking like tryhard morons that wanna sound so international and most of the time they have a rather poor accent which makes it even more ridiculous i do mix french english on the reg when i talk but its because i spent a while in england and now some words come faster in my mind in english than in french overall french people dont hate english theyre just bad at it really a lot of newer words come in our language in their english form and we pronounce them with our terrible accent
Overwatch,not_removed,i wouldnt say french people hate having english words in france its generally seen as a trendy modern language everyone should speak most movie titles stay in english for example now there are regions of the world where everything gets translated and french language is almost sacred québec for instance is a common laughing stock in france for their hilariously litteral movie translations
Overwatch,not_removed,lol no
Overwatch,not_removed,dude have you tried lol were all gamers here how hard is it to open a downloaded file in rainmeter then just extract the file and click load and that is it
Overwatch,not_removed,it can be cryptic if you want to make your own skins but if you want to use someone else you only need to press on it
Overwatch,not_removed,you literally download the skin go to rain meter select place the skin or whatever it says and it pops up on your desktop then you drag it around and then back in rain meter you can make it undraggable and clickthrough
Overwatch,not_removed,the locations and the names of your apps have to be linked in the buttonsvariablesinc file in the resources folder
Overwatch,not_removed,thank you so much guy you roxx d its an honour for me
Overwatch,not_removed,hi ankore its me again well you can guess it sombra is now out and some people wants me to uppdate my rainmeter skin with her so i have to ask for your help one more time haha so can you please when youll have the time of course make a wallpaper of sombra it would be really really nice
Overwatch,not_removed,no no you have to place it left from your open program space so the open program space will be on the center of your bar
Overwatch,not_removed,right click on the bar unselect the displaying of the names and make the icons bigger then move it left to your open programs
Overwatch,not_removed,youre welcome
Overwatch,not_removed,or you use rocketdock it works similar to this
Overwatch,not_removed,i think the are useless try it without
Overwatch,not_removed,it was pretty harsh but ive replaced all the skins positions and scales by variables depending of the scale of your screen just download it again and it will erase the old one
Overwatch,not_removed,mhh to be honest i havent had these problems ill look into it
Overwatch,not_removed,it was pretty harsh but ive replaced all the skins positions and scales by variables depending of the scale of your screen just download it again and it will erase the old one the locations and the names of your apps have to be linked in the buttonsvariablesinc file in the resources folder
Overwatch,not_removed,normally if you put differents paths in the buttonsvariablesinc file in the resources folder youre not supposed to have this problem
Overwatch,not_removed,right click on the button go on properties then uncheck align with borders si you can move it at the pixel that you want to
Overwatch,not_removed,hum no its not the one of the illustro skin but the overwatch heroes skin
Overwatch,not_removed,there are enough subreddits to help you at to join the pcmasterace hehe
Overwatch,not_removed,sorry but all you can do its to poen the rainmeter manager select the portraits skin then move it with the xy position but for the buttons you can move them from the text
Overwatch,not_removed,could indeed work but you will notice the reduce in performance from whatve heard
Overwatch,not_removed,more then enough
Overwatch,not_removed,oh so theyre not in the wrong spots im just ignant
Overwatch,not_removed,i guess itd be weird to have a healer named thanks
Overwatch,not_removed,erncockworthington is probably right on mercy roadhog chopper i have no idea
Overwatch,not_removed,mostly because the names in the game are very descriptive and you need to save both the meaning and the euphony in translation roadhog for example can be transliterated to any language but it wont mean anything in most of them and if you translate it literally hog of the road it wont sound like one badass postapocalyptic gangster nickname so the translators are looking for a workaround in each particular case in russian version for example considering well try to do a reversetranslation roadhog is called turboboar and mercy is angel
Overwatch,not_removed,how much ram does it take up though
Overwatch,not_removed,on my work computer its stretched but thats probably due to my monitors only being httpiimgurcomxsarflwpng
Overwatch,not_removed,yeah you can drag it on your second monitor as well or make a copy of the skin folder so you can open it twice one on each screen
Overwatch,not_removed,the second monitor would be empty by default assuming youre not cloning displays itll show whatever it normally shows ie whatever wallpaper you have set you could probably clone the theme and have the same rainmeter theme on your second monitor but youll have to play around with the positioning of the objects might be able to just click and drag if your monitors are physically different sizes the object sizes might not work perfectly either and youll have to scale them to fit right not actually sure on this one or if you wanted you could replace the files from the wallpaper of the rainmeter skin with something twice as long so it itll extend onto the second monitor eg create a image where the left or right side is the image from the rainmeter skin and the other side which will be on the other monitor is some genji fanart or whatever set one up for each character and have art on both screens change with the heroes
Overwatch,not_removed,its per monitor display meaning that each monitorscreen can have a different set up or you can custom make your own the equalizerhex stuff on the right screen is part of rainmeter apps the datetimememory etc on the left screen is also another part of rainmeter apps nothing is on the middle monitor the way rainmeter works isnt that its like a full on program swap most arent at least it just gives you little gadgetsetc to put on your background you most of the time choose the wallpapers
Overwatch,not_removed,basically the way rainmeter works is that a skin has a set workspace and it renders imagesmeters within that workspace for something like this that workspace is the resolution of a single monitor it doesnt replace your wallpaper it just displays an image thats set to show behind all other windows mimicing a wallpaper the buttons are displayed above the wallpaper image if you want it to display across both screens you would either have to edit the skin to change the positioning or copy the skin folder and load it twice
Overwatch,not_removed,yo let me know too
Overwatch,not_removed,you mostly likely have windows or below
Overwatch,not_removed,it was pretty harsh but ive replaced all the skins positions and scales by variables depending of the scale of your screen just download it again and it will erase the old one
Overwatch,not_removed,perfect ive added the link on the deviantart page for all who have
Overwatch,not_removed,perfect ill ad the link in the description of the deviantart page
Overwatch,not_removed,thanks the buttons dont work but that might just be a pathing problem also need to figure out how to get it to adjust to my resolution
Overwatch,not_removed,in swedish as well
Overwatch,not_removed,the funny thing is that in french the grim reaper is called la faucheuse ie feminine so faucheur sounds a lot less edgy than reaper
Overwatch,not_removed,yeah but its really far of the original meaning because roadhog chauffard in french
Overwatch,not_removed,grâce would be a name more respectful of the original meaning ah je regardais pas caméra café
Overwatch,not_removed,the englishasalanguage situation is changing pretty damn fast though the last generation grew up with streaming and foreign media they could get early so as to not wait for french tv to catch up as such many people below can hold a conversation in english with a decent accent thanks subtitled shows
Overwatch,not_removed,thnx for taking it the right way i wasnt trying to throw shade and wasnt sure if it would come across as intended the reason why im asking is because here in les paysbas we get thought during french class that the french are very proud of their language and they hate loanwords especially coming from the english language since i know that a handful of teachers and my own anecdotal evidence from my trips to france and wallonia where people refused to reply in english are hardly scientific i thought it would be better to just ask you tbh i always thought my teachers were exaggerating and that my own experiences were due to people not being able to reply in english andor being old of age my perception may have also been wrong due to the believe over here that the french are too stubborn to reply in english probably fed by thousands of dutch people who go camping in france and had a similar experience i figured that the younger generation would use english words form time to time even if it was only in slang thank you and unightstroll for clarifying
Overwatch,not_removed,here in québec they have to translate movies and make up new words such as courriel for email and clavarder for chatting because of our strict law to protect french i agree that some movie titles are just plain horrible though
Overwatch,not_removed,name checks out
Overwatch,not_removed,ignore the troll op i know how annoying it is to make a skin that does everything automatically thanks for putting in the effort ill be running this once i get my new rig
Overwatch,not_removed,it doesnt fit my desktop with the character selection going off my screen how do i fix this
Overwatch,not_removed,i only have the options to select out of buttonsportraitswallpapers the tab with buttons has all the heroes but none of the heroes have the name spotify or steam in their thingy i dont have a seperate resource folder
Overwatch,not_removed,thank you so much for taking your time for me now its updated all thanks to you
Overwatch,not_removed,haha sure mate it is on my radar since his launch dont worry i will just upgrade the imgur gallery with it asap
Overwatch,not_removed,gallery updated check it out
Overwatch,not_removed,oh ha my bad
Overwatch,not_removed,no option of unselecting of names
Overwatch,not_removed,hey that worked thanks a lot
Overwatch,not_removed,yeah thank you d
Overwatch,not_removed,i still cant get it to launch the program it still just opens up the folder any idea what i could be doing wrong edit never mind im an idiot forgot to refresh rainmeter
Overwatch,not_removed,still a little messed up im so sorry heres a picture of what it looks like on my screen httpimgurcomavwocsh
Overwatch,not_removed,yeah ive clicked around and messed with it thats okay
Overwatch,not_removed,ive found it thank you
Overwatch,not_removed,yeah just working on the financial department right now lol
Overwatch,not_removed,would it though might be the most appropriate name for a healer
Overwatch,not_removed,choper originaly chopper is french for caughtgrab etc i guess they wanted us french to say chopper mas chopé wich means roadhog grabed me
Overwatch,not_removed,thanks
Overwatch,not_removed,very little tested it out and its only but thats with some skins that ive made running as well
Overwatch,not_removed,rainmeter ram usage is proportional to the skins open for instance my setup uses mb note ops skin requires the beta version of rainmeter
Overwatch,not_removed,where does it get your second monitors wallpaper from or do you have a wall paper and then rainmaker simply puts an overlay on your screen ive never used it or even heard of it before lol so this is all news to me
Overwatch,not_removed,nice setup
Overwatch,not_removed,using windows
Overwatch,not_removed,shit man i didnt mean for you to go to that length im sincerely grateful though
Overwatch,not_removed,edit disregard my previous post to set paths for the buttons do this right click manage skin right click any of the icons under active skins open containing folder navigate to the resources folder open buttonsvariables for editing set paths here best of luck
Overwatch,not_removed,pretty sure in russian too
Overwatch,not_removed,so it looks like soldier is just another example of the english language wanting to be special
Overwatch,not_removed,in sweden we call him soldier though because were not idiots
Overwatch,not_removed,couldnt find the episode on youtube but it was quite funny simply put the security guard at the office andré is this massive hulking bully picking on everyone and he called his bulldog pitié mercy because thats what everyone screams when the animal basically wants to eat their ankles for breakfast
Overwatch,not_removed,well obviously i cant speak for my whole country but im pretty sure its only old people who have a problem with english id say above you start to meet people who are incapable of saying at least hello sorry no english the stories about being proud of the language etc was right for my grandparents both my grandmother are not very fond of being invaded by english language with all the new technology words etc but they wouldnt be aggressive toward anyone speaking english we have a ton of loanwords in our language as i said most of the new words are straightup importated without translation we just pronounce them really really really bad haha i love my language for a lot of things including music and writing but english is cool too only morons would be negative towards someone speaking another language and well as everywhere we have some retards in our country too
Overwatch,not_removed,the protection of french language is actually in québecs law i didnt know what are the basic terms of it
Overwatch,not_removed,the resources forlder is in documentsrainmeterskinsoverwatch heroes
Overwatch,not_removed,thank you so much i had uppdated my skin now thanks to you im really gratefull
Overwatch,not_removed,if you right clic on your unlocked taskbar where your new toolbar is youll have a menu with display title and display names
Overwatch,not_removed,ive updated the download link from my deviantart page try it out im sure itll work
Overwatch,not_removed,try to select the ini in the rainmeter manager then you ll have a bunch of options for positioning it
Overwatch,not_removed,lol but wouldnt it be pronounced choppé anyway cuz of the er road hog is a verb confirmed like how some french call roger rogé
Overwatch,not_removed,thats my normal wallpaper rainmaker puts an overlay over the desktop covers up my icons too
Overwatch,not_removed,the da link has links to dl for windows or just did it works fine
Overwatch,not_removed,im just editing the files to put them in the right place its going to suck since i only finished the genji and mccree page and fixed the portraits at the bottom
Overwatch,not_removed,it was pretty harsh but ive replaced all the skins positions and scales by variables depending of the scale of your screen just download it again and it will erase the old one
Overwatch,not_removed,yes
Overwatch,not_removed,thanks for informing us well add these countries to our list and be sure to invade them when an invasion opening is made available well correct the errors in these countries as soon as possible america the only country worth mentioning in the americas you know the one
Overwatch,not_removed,really i play all my games with english language so i wouldnt know
Overwatch,not_removed,loi law yes basically everything here has to be translated every sign has to be in french if there is an english translation under it it has to be smaller iirc this is all from memory but yes québec had to have those laws to make sure we simply didnt end up all switching to english
Overwatch,not_removed,ok i got that now how do i get the non folder looking icons for documents and such
Overwatch,not_removed,thank you so much it did work fantastic work
Overwatch,not_removed,do you know if there is a way i can get this to display on my second monitor by any chance
Overwatch,not_removed,ohh i see didnt have that when i downloaded mine
Overwatch,not_removed,it was pretty harsh but ive replaced all the skins positions and scales by variables depending of the scale of your screen just download it again and it will erase the old one
Overwatch,not_removed,da ftfy
Overwatch,not_removed,wow i didnt know thanks
Overwatch,not_removed,could be rocketdock
Overwatch,not_removed,for my toolbar ive made it from a folder with all the shortcuts of my apps all with custom icons
Overwatch,not_removed,well it must think my screen is smaller than it is lol it went back to how it was before rip
Overwatch,not_removed,i feel obligated to proceed with one of these rush b cyka funny joeks
Overwatch,not_removed,thanks for the help
Overwatch,not_removed,pc im assuming
Overwatch,not_removed,eu
Overwatch,not_removed,done friends i dont even know
Overwatch,not_removed,i would but im on eu
Overwatch,not_removed,i had friends now i have fps
Overwatch,not_removed,no i will happily add you excuse my grammar it was late when i wrote my last comment
Overwatch,not_removed,im sorry for sounding rude wasnt my intention
Overwatch,not_removed,i was gonna friend you but im consol eu but you have others to play with now haha
Overwatch,not_removed,yes
Overwatch,not_removed,no currently philippines might move to the us sometime soon
Overwatch,not_removed,thanks a lot d cant wait to play with you
Overwatch,not_removed,does that mean we cant be friends on battlenet also can you speak english properly
Overwatch,not_removed,did you add me
Overwatch,not_removed,thanks a lot then d
Overwatch,not_removed,its ok
Overwatch,not_removed,there is a theory where the less friend you have the less fps drops so no sorry my nofriend
Overwatch,not_removed,welcome to my reality
Overwatch,not_removed,wtf lol
Overwatch,not_removed,the message is super confusing because the line which is the smaller one contains the real information i always stay until the end of the game but i know there are players out their who leave the game before the potg even if they won if i were blizz i would only display the line
Overwatch,not_removed,how did it cause the loss
Overwatch,not_removed,sometimes you try to get the maximum overtime possible if you dont see the bar you cant go in and out of the point properly
Overwatch,not_removed,i couldnt see the overtime bar and spent time chasing a roadhog killing him when i could have should have been on the point i though we had more time
Overwatch,not_removed,strats like this is why i always leave from alternate doors in quickplay
Overwatch,not_removed,these seem like god awful players i especially like zarya not moving at all while contemplating life and the role of turrets in modern society
Overwatch,not_removed,theres a reason why there are three doors to get out of spawn if you see or hear a symmetra putting turrets on one door then dont use that door
Overwatch,not_removed,i never understood why no one is ever looking outside from the attack spawn just look at sym setting up her turrets and use another fucking door ffs
Overwatch,not_removed,here is what i can gather from the responses here symmetra is overpowered needs a nerf the other team was bad and she isnt overpowered also the other team was bad my take though low level play is extremely hurt by characters like symmetra because they can truly dominate very few players at the quick play only level can beat her in close range before her buffs and now it is no contest is this bad idk blizzard is balancing for competitive play where an aggressive symmetra doesnt work as well without the team my advice to any lower tier players trying to counter her group up be aware play classes with an escape and decent range tank up there are options even of your team has taken the character you want for some reason i find a lot of people force themselves to play one character over and over just switchtry a new tactic
Overwatch,not_removed,symmetras not broken that team just had the game sense of a potato
Overwatch,not_removed,how to charge your ult as soon as the game started
Overwatch,not_removed,amirite
Overwatch,not_removed,symm broken nah but tbh every time a semidecent symm is in the other team the fun part of playing dies a bit got a beam on you and you cant kill symm in less than sec youre dead try to run no matter the beam is longer after connecting making even lucio speedboost e on a sprinting soldier not being fast enough to escape death trying to get to cover nop that beam will follow you around corners for a weapon that doesnt need aim the extensible range and increasing damage output that does not reset when swapping target can be worse way worse that hook
Overwatch,not_removed,well yeah if the other team is blind and challenged any hero is broken try this in comp haha
Overwatch,not_removed,syms only op feature is that weapon no aim or skill or anything other than jumping around like an idiot is needed to kill anyone in the game i dont mind the turrets or shieldportals you can take them down once you find them but that f gun really triggers me
Overwatch,not_removed,yea they were dumb but youre also an asshole
Overwatch,not_removed,i have no idea why people are salty over this this is hilarious that team was dumb trying to deathball through the main exit when the ice wall should of been a sign to use another exit
Overwatch,not_removed,this was my friends and i playing last night the potatoes getting killed not one of our brightest moments but hey its all for fun glad it got posted too funny
Overwatch,not_removed,sym is broken aka i play qp against really bad players and roftlstomp them
Overwatch,not_removed,so broken she has a pickrate
Overwatch,not_removed,maybe they werent the best players but we didnt get much of a chance to find out their replacements were pretty decent though and since i feel the gif doesnt do it justice httpsyoutubedchqpsxjzo
Overwatch,not_removed,looks like amateurs who lack any kind of situational awareness they deserve to get microwaved
Overwatch,not_removed,thats not broken thats a dimwitted team on the other side
Overwatch,not_removed,upvoted for best symm skin
Overwatch,not_removed,awesome play but their whole team left through the safe doorway pretty sure theres at least three exits on every map isnt there lol xd
Overwatch,not_removed,so after reading all of these posts what im seeing is that people are okay with not getting close to bastion reaper or reins hammer but syms space being respected as a really stupid zone to be in is completely offensive bastion gets focused hes obviously a threat treat her the same also she cant get her beam through a rein shield if you see a sym near your rein use his shield like youre supposed to and make her feel stupid for overextending
Overwatch,not_removed,ive been saying this pretty much since she got buffed shes no longer a support if she can a team blizzard seem to have little to no interest in nerfing her though or if they do i havent heard about it they seem to be making a lot of hero changes but im puzzled why shes not one of them
Overwatch,not_removed,the only reason this works in any match is because people are too stupid to use side doors
Overwatch,not_removed,sym s beam definitely needs a nerf tho
Overwatch,not_removed,nerf her please
Overwatch,not_removed,sym is one of the reasons i have been playing less overwatch lately
Overwatch,not_removed,off season quick play at its finest ladies and gentlemen
Overwatch,not_removed,symmetra ruins games since the can just destroy all offense with two seconds of left clicking and aimbot just does the work for them
Overwatch,not_removed,she is truly broken tho
Overwatch,not_removed,this honestly just seems like an incompetent team everyone just stands there the sniper does fuckall and this wasnt purely symmetra
Overwatch,not_removed,her attack locks on and requires no aiming and it does far to much damage
Overwatch,not_removed,the real problem with sym is her damage potential her primary has a build to at meters with little aim involved soloing at that range is no competition unless you have a good mobility option in low play she dominates because you need more than decent aim to hit her while she bhops and strafes couple that with an extra hp from a shield generator that an unorganized team cant get to you are basically fucked playing against a competent sym
Overwatch,not_removed,she is definitely not broken
Overwatch,not_removed,i did notice yesterday on numbani that a turret was almost impossible to destroy because it was placed behind a tree the turret had no issue hitting people but shooting at it did nothing to destroy them i had to stand next to the tree and wall and shoot at it to destroy it that could have happened here too
Overwatch,not_removed,i hate you so much
Overwatch,not_removed,title needs to be change to how to play like a pro
Overwatch,not_removed,listen im a charter evangelical member of the nerf symmetras beam length back to what it was organization nsblbtwiw for short but im pretty sure the old beam would have done the same thing against this team holy hell
Overwatch,not_removed,thats what they get for having that shitty squishy comp
Overwatch,not_removed,i absolutely love when the defending team tries this when im on attack theyre completely overextended and we have a massive spawnroom advantage fall back heal up and get just one or two picks and your team is suddenly very advantaged on top of that its unlikely they have good defensive positioning on the point just switch to someone like tracer and dance past them to start capping
Overwatch,not_removed,im trying this one out
Overwatch,not_removed,i just got a quad with sym
Overwatch,not_removed,i think the problem with sym is not that shes op or broken but that she offers too much reward for how little skill is needed to use her weapon its just tuned a little too sensitive something a bit closer to winstons gun would be a lot better and perhaps tweaking its damage down slightly
Overwatch,not_removed,how to achieve tp in seconds
Overwatch,not_removed,something similar happened to me last night was playing show your support on route on defense one of our syms got a sextuple team kill right off the bat potg of course id never heard the voice line for sextuple kill before
Overwatch,not_removed,the play of the game was the first play
Overwatch,not_removed,i never go through the main door because it only leads to moments like this
Overwatch,not_removed,my only real issue is symmetras ability to chain mass groups of enemies due to the time her weapon has to find a new target and still retain max damage seconds nothing else is really a problem
Overwatch,not_removed,aaaaannd they all respawn in just seconds
Overwatch,not_removed,broken false
Overwatch,not_removed,this happened on hanmura told my team symmetra was placing turrets outside and three of them decide to go through that door she got a triple in the first seconds of the match
Overwatch,not_removed,youre the reason why i wait a couple seconds to creep out the side exits
Overwatch,not_removed,yey got potg now run before they respawn
Overwatch,not_removed,her ammo is stupid long though
Overwatch,not_removed,times like is this is when im not proud to be indian misrepresented by op bullpoop
Overwatch,not_removed,thats why i never go out that front door unless im reindva lol
Overwatch,not_removed,symmetra version of the quick play bastion strat
Overwatch,not_removed,cancer claims entire opposing team gif not sure about that title man
Overwatch,not_removed,no
Overwatch,not_removed,i dunno that looks pretty balanced to me
Overwatch,not_removed,this is not the only instance where symmetra is unbearable
Overwatch,not_removed,wow at your disgusting cheesying but so many people are totally oblivious so gross cheesing like this happens
Overwatch,not_removed,oh boi another skillmetra potg
Overwatch,not_removed,she aint broken
Overwatch,not_removed,ive learned to count to before leaving spawn
Overwatch,not_removed,of my potgs are this ult in seconds even if you die its worth it for the teleporter right away
Overwatch,not_removed,this was cancer
Overwatch,not_removed,true reason to main sym
Overwatch,not_removed,god that is filthy
Overwatch,not_removed,i really hope she doesnt get nerfed because lowlevel players cant figure out how counter her the amount of players i see backing away from sym while she throws a shield at them is ridiculous shes pretty easy to counter and almost balanced in my opinion the only thing id change on her is her beam disconnect range i think its a bit off that fast characters designed to escape soldierlucio can barely even force the beam to disconnect id say leave the attach range at and reduce the detatch range to is too much maybe add some los checks like roadhog might be too much she could use a slight damage debuff on console since she avoids the disadvantage of a controller while every other character has to deal with that disadvantage but i still dont know if its necessary detatch range changes might be all she needs
Overwatch,not_removed,as a symm main when on attack i always place my own turrets at the bottom of the door on this inside that way when the door opens it gets the crap junkrat places outside and the red symms turrets that she has placed on the doors problem solved
Overwatch,not_removed,lolol also people are in here acting like she is the strongest bully that no one can counter and that she takes no skillmeanwhile in game i still get hella flack for picking her on attackhypocritical much
Overwatch,not_removed,hey i got an idea lets buff an already easymode operpowered hero that automatically aims and slows by giving her autoaiming and slowing turrets more damage that will surely work blizzard
Overwatch,not_removed,ive done this dozens of times and i can say from experience it only works on the ignorant or unprepared and even then its barely a speed bump on most teams advancement if the opposing team rage quit because of an ambush as simple as that you got the most easily tilted opponents ever
Overwatch,not_removed,sym is not broken she is incredibly difficult to master and if you find yourself against someone like myself who knows how to use her it will feel broken
Overwatch,not_removed,honestly its their fault for letting her get that close
Overwatch,not_removed,not broken just oblivious she doesnt need any changes the counter to sym is spacial awareness
Overwatch,not_removed,are you proud of this looks like a crap low level quickplay game its just embarrassing to watch
Overwatch,not_removed,lets face it this footage is a terrible example on how and in what symmetra has too much power you cant really judge the opness on an opening play against a clueless team still symmetra needs some numbers tweaks imo
Overwatch,not_removed,if syms gun was nerfed she would functionally never be picked right now she is the definition of a glass cannon take away the cannon part and youre left with something pretty fragile and functionally useless
Overwatch,not_removed,you should modify the title with how to make an unskilled enemy team rage quit thats clearly all this is i honestly dont even think this would work against mid plats
Overwatch,not_removed,the only thing i dont like is the fact that her beam doesnt require any aim what the hell is that about why cant being able to aim properly be a requirement same as every other character in the game
Overwatch,not_removed,symmetra is broken aka the enemy team were completely unaware
Overwatch,not_removed,the hero is literally no fun no aim is required and her dps is almost better if not better than reaper lol
Overwatch,not_removed,she may not be op but she is definitely a character that takes literally no skill whatsoever the most skill required is where to place your turrets which is not hard and knowing when to place a tel or shield gen thats literally it no real skill required edit incoming sym users to downvote this comment
Overwatch,not_removed,sym isnt broken the lets all storm out of the center entrance of our spawn room strategy is every single spawn room has multiple exits despite this i constantly play in teams where our entire group meanders out the main exit and gets obliterated then whines about not being able to get out of spawn meanwhile ive gone out the side exit flanked our opponents and am capping the objective the attackers spawn has an awesome exit to the side i can see in this potg that the symm has no turrets over there while shes standing there thinking shes gonna get potg you all could have been slipping out the side completely negating all of her turrets its about playing smarter not bitching about how one person chose to play a hero i think its unsporting to spawn camp but theres no rules against it so you have to use strategy
Overwatch,not_removed,support
Overwatch,not_removed,shes extremely op nerf the range
Overwatch,not_removed,why is it that when a hero is completely overpowered half the subreddit tries to claim they arent
Overwatch,not_removed,i find that one of symmetras biggest advantages and contributions to the team is psychological warfare i mean so she wiped out most of the opposing team right from the spawn using ambush tactics and a distraction in the form of a roadhog teammate thats going to lose the opposing team what maybe seconds total and if theyre any decent yeah i know they quit but im talking about the general scenario they will deal with her quickly if she lingers outside the door as they come back the real impact is the tilt coming from being caught in an ambush which people tend not to deal with very well and once tilted theres a good chance theyll either quit or start playing significantly worse this is one of the reasons i like playing symmetra the game isnt about aiming at pixel heads anymore its all about positional and psychological strategy and yes i still hate dying to symmetra as zenyatta my other main especially when the symmetra is jumping around in the open like a maniac and nobody seems to be able to shoot her joys of being a gold player
Overwatch,not_removed,imo symmetra needs a bastionstyle rework that weakens her in lowlevel play but gives her some high level options
Overwatch,not_removed,to people thinking she is a nightmare in low elo im in bronze and console and she doesnt dominate
Overwatch,not_removed,so i know this is probably not the most accurate of opinions im a year league veteran who quit recently and switched to overwatch currently level my impression of symmetra is that shes unfair in a way that no other hero is in this game her hit box is tiny and she doest need to aim precisely at least which means she can hop around like a moron and never be hit because people like me cant aim for their life it seems like this gives her a very unfair advantage in that she can control zones with her turrets but isnt even necessarily weak if you catch her outside her nest what the result of this becomes is that newunskilled players feel helpless against her for reasons that arent even supposed to be her main strength it feels absolutely dreadful going up against her like my close friends are goldplat and say the exact same thing why does almost every hero in this game require aiming and coordination if you want to dodge and shoot but she hardly even needs to be looking at you as she runs circles around you she already has unique gameplay centered around zone control and heavy utility so why does she have this fallback pattern of being able to stomp low elo with her primary weapon there are often times champions in league that feel like this but they end up getting gutted until they can be reworked which is something ive always thought made the game better symmetra may be balanced overall but that doesnt mean she isnt an awful design in her current state sorry about the wall of text and borderline rant but this hero and her pervasiveness in my games has made me beyond angry
Overwatch,not_removed,theres nothing more infuriating than watching my entire team trying to push out the main door right into the enemy teams kill box for an entire fucking match and completely ignore the other exits
Overwatch,not_removed,its so easy to counter you just have to have someone looking out the door as soon as you see symmetra setting up her turrets you change doors yet so many people myself included fall into this stupid trap over and over again
Overwatch,not_removed,especially in eichenwalde that front door is a kill box
Overwatch,not_removed,before they put the one hero limit in qp i once got out of numbani attack spawn and there was bastion pocketed by mercy on far left and on far right my team got completely wiped when we first got out
Overwatch,not_removed,its amazing how many people fall for it even when it is clearly stated what is going to happen
Overwatch,not_removed,ive done this just from farther away in comp so youre not safe either
Overwatch,not_removed,one time i saw an enemy mei outside the spawn door in volskaya and i told my team she was going to wall the front so we should all head out the left door we ended up taking the first point in less than a minute as one their teammates was uhh conveniently missing
Overwatch,not_removed,its not like she would have been able to escape from the beam sniper anyway
Overwatch,not_removed,not necessary awful i have same problem its hard to notice that you are taking damage because apart of some indicators which are very hard to notice there is nothing to tell you that you are under attack well im below master so i guess im simply an awful player
Overwatch,not_removed,word im wondering why the opposing team arent leaving their base en masse and are taking down the turrets
Overwatch,not_removed,and not pressing shift
Overwatch,not_removed,this is actually the issue i have with her technically speaking she is balanced but that is assuming both players know what theyre doing at low levels of play shes borderline if not entirely op in the land of scrubs the man who doesnt need to aim is king you can dump on bad players with anyone if youre better than them but they should be getting rekt by the player not by the character alone maybe its just me picking up design values from years of lol but having a lopsided success rate across skill levels is worth considering in terms of balance low success in bronze but very successful at the top end means usually means the character is difficult to play but rewards time and effort if its too successful at the top its considered op despite a poor performance among plebs the opposite is also true pooraverage performance among pros doesnt negate the fact that its oppressing bronze i also think it stunts the players performance it probably feels good for scrubs to be able to dominate but theyre using it as a crutch and in stead of improving why learn to aim when you can just not have to aim there are plenty of other options for people that cant shoot for shit and theyre far less lazy
Overwatch,not_removed,she was reloading everyone knows you cant move while reloading
Overwatch,not_removed,because nobody can hear the sound of turrets being placed over the gunfire from pharahhogwidow shooting all of the popcorn buckets and trash cans x
Overwatch,not_removed,if you see or hear a symmetra putting turrets on one door sorry too busy breaking things and emoting
Overwatch,not_removed,its hilarious having someone call out a sym trapping the door one guy swapping to winston destroy them all then swap back usually better to just turret off a flank
Overwatch,not_removed,true but doesnt change the fact that she has a lock on ability that does that doesnt drop between heroes and gets extended range on lock
Overwatch,not_removed,for some reason no matter the map no matter the gamemode people dont seem to realize that theres generally doors out of spawn on every map the purpose is so you cant get trapped in spawn otherwise that would be horrible map design edit actually this applies to every part of every map theres generally more than way to go about getting to the same place
Overwatch,not_removed,so when i play hanzo on defense i always shoot a sonic arrow at the attacker spawn like before the match starts this helps me see what ill be up against and because of that when im an attacker i always avoid hanging out near the doors until its time to move
Overwatch,not_removed,thats why a good symmetra will sneakily put turrets on side door then very obviously stand in clear vision pretending to put them on the main door works of the time it doesnt fail
Overwatch,not_removed,you can put turrets without being seen just take the stairs to the second floor and go around you can hear them though
Overwatch,not_removed,because everyone is always doing their pre match emote spamming crouch spamming or spray spamming
Overwatch,not_removed,yeah really thats exactly what i was thinking
Overwatch,not_removed,in general yes but iirc on hollywood you cant see through the doors in the spawn
Overwatch,not_removed,also the observation deck on gibraltar just go up there immediately and watch youll see where everyone is setting up what heroes they are and where people are hiding or you can just run out and get instakilled if thats your thing
Overwatch,not_removed,you can only control yourself and you can only ever count on your own performance youre also going to have to fight her at some point her mere existence makes the game slow to a crawl she was overtuned and so is bastion now i dont know why factually but if i had to guess id say they want the general match speed to slow down theyve been nerfing lúcios speed boost this whole time for the same purpose the faster the game is the less understandable the game will be as a spectator sport this has been one of the biggest complains lobbed at the game as an esport from both scene professionals and casuals explaining why they cant get into it it is in blizzards best interest to change that very gradually make of that what you will
Overwatch,not_removed,in no limits at least she definitely is op nothing quite like a triple shield gen stack
Overwatch,not_removed,my problem with symmetra is that i solo queue on there really isnt any way to communicate with my team and it can be very hard to hit her while she is jumping around and microwaving you console aiming is a bitch before her buff she had to get close enough that you could usually kill her pretty easily
Overwatch,not_removed,my take though low level play is extremely hurt by characters like symmetra because they can truly dominate very few players at the quick play only level can beat her in close range before her buffs and now it is no contest really im no mccree expert but it seems like hed be a very hard counter to symmetra at close range with little skill required flashbang fth she ded is that not the case
Overwatch,not_removed,as a fairly new player about weeks i find a few hours a week in mystery heroes really boosts my confidence when i need to make a change mid match
Overwatch,not_removed,defense symmetra is a problem up in masters too its ridicolously easy to play her and force the match into a draw simply because she gets ulti instantly and its really annoying to get through chokes vs her i rarely ever see the point of a map because of her
Overwatch,not_removed,my advice to low tier players against sym winston charge in drop shield and hold left mouse while running in and out of shield her beams cant go through your shield she has to right click for that your beam goes through her shield and if youre low health and wont get her jump to the nearest roof with shift
Overwatch,not_removed,blizzard should just balance the game towards the level that the majority of players are at which i believe is gold and at that level symmetra almost always wins a fight
Overwatch,not_removed,symmetras definitely broken but that team was also full of potatoes
Overwatch,not_removed,the thing is when you put two teams of low but equal skill against each other and the defense has sym and torb the king and queen of free value one team has a massively worse time than the other even though we already established that all players are equal people insist that its just the nature of the characters but why is it that the only two characters that get this kind of massive advantage on one side are also the ones that dont need player input for lengthy periods of time to still provide substantial supportive and offensive value the defense advantage aspect is only a small part the actual imbalance there is that both have autonomous offensive functions and they build things that usually must be countered by multiple players at once requiring coordinationgamesense thats not required to the same degree on the defending team thats utilizing the only two free value heroes in the game
Overwatch,not_removed,yes she is the fact that this team is garbage doesnt excuse that
Overwatch,not_removed,i always wait for my team to go outside first i refuse to be fried like a potato
Overwatch,not_removed,space bar
Overwatch,not_removed,this arguing whether or not symmetra is op or not is important her winrate is fairly even after all what is important is whether she if fun to play and to play against sure shes fun but frankly nothing feels as terrible as dying to symmetras auto aim idk about anyone else but i feel she needs some kind of rework on her weapon
Overwatch,not_removed,its better than winstons tesla cannon imo which is alarming
Overwatch,not_removed,so dont get close to her problem solved
Overwatch,not_removed,reinhardt reaper dva pharah roadhog and a couple of others dont really need to aim either and use splash damage or radius to hit their foes
Overwatch,not_removed,yes but i am also a really bad player ergo
Overwatch,not_removed,because we are all pro players with accuracy so the fact that the aimbot beam requires no aiming doesnt matter
Overwatch,not_removed,exactly shes not exactly tournament meta jeez no one seems to have any respect for spacing skill the ability to intelligently move and engage only inside of your effective range sym takes little to no aim but stupid players cant do much with her shes annoying but play her for a few hours and youll understand her weaknesses much better and you might even have a tiny bit of respect for good syms probably not though
Overwatch,not_removed,hopefully they put a fight up against ur sym abusin ass
Overwatch,not_removed,im wearing red so it doesnt show your blood as much
Overwatch,not_removed,another note dvas that put up their defense matrix against sym thanks for the giggles
Overwatch,not_removed,youre right in that she doesnt belong in support shes more defense than anything now but she honestly does not need a nerf the only time shes truly broken is in no limits and they sure arent going to balance based on thatbecause its no limits the only way she can steamroll a team is if they collectively choose to ignore hertheir surroundings as this team did running blindly all out the front spawn door and failing to take out the turrets immediately was what helped her drop zarya which then gave her microwave the power to continue dropping everyone else that was still alive by that point if they had paid attention to what was happening outside their spawn door before the match and either had a winston take out the turrets or gone out a side door this would have gone very differently ive played plenty of matches as symmetra where once i get two or more enemies on me especially if ones a tank unless one of them is just about dead or if ive got turrets placed i can retreat to theres a fairly good chance ill be toast shortly after she is definitely powerful but she is certainly not invincible as many others have said in this thread players with good situational awareness and coordination treat her like the potential threat she is and focus her down as they should
Overwatch,not_removed,make her walk slower when its firing annoys me when i cant speed boost away as lucio when she locks on
Overwatch,not_removed,either do waaay less damage or waaay less range cant have both
Overwatch,not_removed,if this is your experience with sym then you are playing against her poorly or dont understand how to play against her at all
Overwatch,not_removed,
Overwatch,not_removed,every time you find one of those screenshot it and bug report it those turret positions are not supposed to exist dozens of them were already fixed in the game
Overwatch,not_removed,zarya is a tank she died first
Overwatch,not_removed,then shes useless you wouldnt get in reapers face why would you get in hers
Overwatch,not_removed,difficult to master difficult as if reaper didnt have to aim and could recover half his health everytime he hides for secs lol
Overwatch,not_removed,she is not difficult to master she is mechanically simple mastering her requires game knowledge which is much easier to come by for most i will admit that a surprising number of players are awful with someone like sym they can left click just like anyone else but dont know when and where to place turretsteleportsshields
Overwatch,not_removed,she is jokingly easy to use and wipe with
Overwatch,not_removed,what they just came out of spawn you cant stop someone from getting close to the spawn its their fault for not realizing she was there sure but theres nothing they could have done about her going there
Overwatch,not_removed,and winston
Overwatch,not_removed,i agree that the enemy team is having a lack of awareness they could have understood the situation and ran back it to switch their hero or something but the main problem with her is not the photon cannons or her ultimate its her damage which is pretty high for how much aiming work she needs to do if i played symmetra i dont have to care about aim at allall i have to do it bunny hop and avoid their attacks and bam team kill winston has such a weapon too but it doesnt do thaat much damage
Overwatch,not_removed,she is a support the kit should be utility with the energy barrier teleporter shield generator and photon cannons right now she can reliably do tonnes of damage if she gains charge on anyone reliable dpscompare that to mcrees unreliable dps or soldiers very much impossible to get dps like a zarya or anyone who cant track hero movement properly once she gains charge she destroys anyone and everyone in her path
Overwatch,not_removed,idk if this kind of play works in mid plat but hero itself still works up until diamond and if you are exceptionally good you can get to grandmaster with symm there are a lot of symmetra one trick players in grandmastermaster
Overwatch,not_removed,her dps is almost better if not better than reaper lol no her fullycharged dps is without the ability to headshot reapers dps is and can headshot it just seems like she deals so much damage because she cant miss so she can apply that damage more efficiently than reaper can especially at low ranks where everybody has shit aim
Overwatch,not_removed,definitely not better than reaper headshot and then bodyshot and shes done
Overwatch,not_removed,theres fun in picking good turret placement getting people to the front lines faster and generally outwitting your enemies even if you dont have the hitscan skillz
Overwatch,not_removed,she has many direct counters to her if played competently mccree pharah junkrat mei rein winston roadhog can all effectively nullify her left click or kill her quickly without a large amount of skill and that doesnt even count hitscan heroes that utterly destroy her if you can aim well shes really good at punishing uncoordinated teams but is mediocre against a well executed push when compared to most other heroes and she cant one shot non tanks at point blank range like reaper can
Overwatch,not_removed,except no mobility or escape mechanisms other than throwing a shield in the enemys direction
Overwatch,not_removed,yup i almost made it to silver so by no means am i some amazing player yet i can guarantee there will be sym turrets andor widowhanzo pointing at the front exit every time also there are windows its not like sym will get there before you its pretty obvious bad players are bad
Overwatch,not_removed,i look forward to hearing what you think of bastion in a couple of days x
Overwatch,not_removed,because they usually arent overpowered and people are just pissed off because they havent figured out how to deal with a health hero with no long range attacks
Overwatch,not_removed,because shes not completely overpowered against anyone with anything that resembles skill what you see in op is the classic bronzesilver tier players getting wrecked by a strategy that would more than likely end up causing the symetra team to lose if it were plat or higher
Overwatch,not_removed,its because no one wants to admit they play the current meta cheap hero i didnt wanna admit it when i played mccree on season and they dont wanna admit it about sym now because that gets ur favorite character weakned but the nice part about seasons and metas is her noob ass will be replaced by another op hero when enough character changes are implemented
Overwatch,not_removed,so that they can continue to ruin others games by being symettra
Overwatch,not_removed,thats going to lose the opposing team what maybe seconds total its going to lose the attacking team health each at least relatively until they can find and destroy the shield generator
Overwatch,not_removed,humans have no claws no thick hard skin we are currently the most dominant species on earth lions are ferocious hunters and are currently endangered the reason i point this is because you just pointed out a bunch facts that made it seem like symmetra is weak you didnt even address her strong point her left click and energy barrier seriously asking you a question do you have win rate against her
Overwatch,not_removed,so when her nest is destroyed and the map requires a lot of mobility what do you expect from her the payload in hollywood for example going through town where do you see a nest being useful because without current setup shed never get used
Overwatch,not_removed,especially when you tell them beforehand junkrat laid a trap out the front door and they walk onto it anyway
Overwatch,not_removed,you just have to have someone looking out the door i do this every time and if i see a symmetra placing turrets i just switch to winston from whatever hero i had originally picked pop shield clear turrets go back to spawn to change back to your intended hero
Overwatch,not_removed,most of the time the other team is too busy shooting kegs or something else making godawful racket they cant even be bothered to watch for this king of thing being setup
Overwatch,not_removed,whoa there situational awareness in overwatch get outta here with that witchcraft
Overwatch,not_removed,the proper door to leave from is upstairs not only is it generally safer from cheese strats its quicker to the choke and gives some of your team high ground
Overwatch,not_removed,everybody is too busy shooting the kegs to hear the turrets trap and mine being set up outside the door
Overwatch,not_removed,i personally prefer the term fuck corridor
Overwatch,not_removed,i cant count count how many times ive called out that a junkrat has set a trap right outside the spawn door and not to go through it round starts teamate dies seconds in
Overwatch,not_removed,she should have looked for a team with two tanks and a lot of health
Overwatch,not_removed,i just wish there was an easier way to shake off the beam after it gets locked onto you i feel that would be a big step to balancing symmetra since the beam slows you down and sticks to you easily edit the beam may or may not slow but the turrets do slow
Overwatch,not_removed,low levels of play shes borderline if not entirely op in bronze and on console here she doesnt dominate dont assume
Overwatch,not_removed,thats why i stop my shenanigans after tminus seconds
Overwatch,not_removed,i always watch out the window as the match is about to begin if i see traps being set up at one exit i go to another sadly the rest of my team often ignores me and rushes out into the traps though kids meh
Overwatch,not_removed,just watch for her walking away from the doors back to safety and if she stays the just kill her wait for everybody to respawn then push in before she gets back
Overwatch,not_removed,you got me there p
Overwatch,not_removed,combine a person with add adhd and a flappy trash can lid and they still stay in spawn flapping the trash can even after match start
Overwatch,not_removed,fair enough p
Overwatch,not_removed,im a symm main so im the one who usually switches to winston or calls it out in chat so satisfying no ez ult charge for you
Overwatch,not_removed,which is offset by the rest of her kit from a symmetra main heres how i think its fair as long as you dont engage with a symmetra within her tether radius then youre fine grab someone who has high hp to get rid of her or alternatively someone with a high dps or shield use walls and other geometry to break the tether always make her a priority kill as much as a healer tldr if you see a symmetra make sure she dies asap just dont get near her if you do make sure you have a back up plan
Overwatch,not_removed,in some maps you can stand in front of the attack spawn door and fire a sonic arrow straight up by the time it drops and hits the ground you can still see who they are using and the cool down on your sonic arrow will be considerably shorter because of flight time
Overwatch,not_removed,her mere existence makes the game slow to a crawl heres the real complaint its not that shes op its just that some people want ow to be an arena death match they dont care about teams or objectives they just want to run in and shoot people symmetra punishes that heavily and people get mad about it its not like a symmetra can use any mechanical skill to out play you she can only outsmart you in terms of positioning and setup if instead of running around on gunfight autopilot you stop and think a moment shes very easy to counter of the time
Overwatch,not_removed,gotta go fast vgtg vgs vgs
Overwatch,not_removed,good points i didnt think they would want to slow the game any more but it makes sense from a esport side of things
Overwatch,not_removed,theyve been nerfing lucios speed boost because lucio was unbelievably overpowered at the start of the game and its sole purpose right now is for the nerfed speed boost and is still take every single game on both sides
Overwatch,not_removed,and this is why i do not play no limits lol
Overwatch,not_removed,i expect to see a ton of no limits no symmetra servers personally limiting to one torb and symm sounds like itd be ideal
Overwatch,not_removed,yeah console is a whole different side of things with auto aim characters like her
Overwatch,not_removed,there are plenty of counters to her but many times those counters are either taken or not as easy to play mccree is commonly picked and fairly hard to play well so many people have trouble picking him to counter a symmetra it isnt necessarily that symmetra really is that great but more that people have trouble beating her in low tier play in higher level play i imagine symmetra is easy to beat once you find her nest but i do not watch competitive play the problem stems from a v between bad players if symmetra gets the jump on someone she will win most of the time and that is why people think she is op
Overwatch,not_removed,mystery heroes is a great way to practice different characters on a fairly even playing field
Overwatch,not_removed,that just sounds infuriating she could probably use a nerf
Overwatch,not_removed,true winston is a good one to simply ruin symmetras day hopefully causing a switch
Overwatch,not_removed,well i mean they did get microwaved
Overwatch,not_removed,exactly this this is neither proof that sym is overpowered nor proof that its always a case of bad players that have to learn how to adjust this is just a team standing in front of a symmetra asking her to melt them
Overwatch,not_removed,symmetra is one of the easiest characters to counter she is far from broken the problem is her biggest counter is gamesense and smart play something a lot of people seem to struggle with apparently
Overwatch,not_removed,how is she broken because the term broken means there is no counter play people now a days dont know what something being truly broken is edit lol god damn yall need to learn how to deal with a hero instead of just bitching because you keep running into her head on plenty of heroes stop symmetra
Overwatch,not_removed,sym is easily countered by every hero in the game
Overwatch,not_removed,explain how she is broken please
Overwatch,not_removed,why is that alarming winston has a hp pool armor and does splash dmg on harambe hops syms gun should be more powerful
Overwatch,not_removed,should we really be encouraging tanks to become more powerful
Overwatch,not_removed,balance has influence over lower levels of play so talking about op in that situation in itself is pretty ridiculous
Overwatch,not_removed,youll understand her weaknesses much better simply put play winston bye bye turrets and symm cant attack through the shield
Overwatch,not_removed,yes they did i mean they fought died and lost but they sure did fight
Overwatch,not_removed,if you boop her you canunless youre running away backwards
Overwatch,not_removed,i feel ya there buddy feelsbadman
Overwatch,not_removed,boop speed boost saves me about of the time
Overwatch,not_removed,totally agree the sym shield charge is ridiculous i would really like blizzard to try seeing if having her damage build reset if the beam disconnects makes her more balanced it would make her more interesting where she plays more as focus damage rather than chain comboing people because she melts people as she deals more damage
Overwatch,not_removed,it has a line of sight problem more than anything the thing doesnt disconnect immediately if you go behind a wall or get behind sym fix that and its all rainbows
Overwatch,not_removed,or even slower charge any one of those three would be reasonable
Overwatch,not_removed,zarya is the easiest tank for symmetra to take out she has no armor and a hard to aim weapon
Overwatch,not_removed,i would get in reapers face he has to actually aim at you its a gamble versus him but its just death versus symmetra she can spin and keep locked on no amount of close range crouch dancing will save you but it helps versus reaper
Overwatch,not_removed,skill floor is incredibly low latch on and do an idiot dance actually want to get stuff done against not idiots takes a lot of work theres tonnes of tricky places to put turrets and where you put them based on what the opponent is doing or who they are tracer is going to go through the door on hanamura or prevent genjujube from getting throught the window scott free which requires knowledge of flanking routes and other things sorta like bastion wave gun in general direction to get kills or appear in random nooks and crannies gunning their asses to give people a live reinterpretation of the omnic crisis
Overwatch,not_removed,easy to play hard to master are two entirely different things bro do you honestly think the hero with the most utility in the game now is auto pilot mode to play lmao no she isnt even a star hero by blizzards standards
Overwatch,not_removed,im sorry youre simply not right unless youre suggesting that im a terrible game player melting the right player at the right moments took a lot of practice placement of turretsteleporstshields takes an enormous amount of skill to be strategically useful i strongly disagree with this idea that shes difficult to master go check overbuff stats on her of the players are terribleis that really because they all suck at the game
Overwatch,not_removed,on lower levels yes but when youre up against players who know what theyre doing it takes a lot of skill to use symmetra effectively shes kind of like lucio hes already useful by just existing and pressing e every now and then but on higher levels hell die quickly if hes not actively using wallriding and boops symmetra can easily wipe just by setting up a death gate and pressing on lower levels but against good players that wont do anything other than feed them ult charge
Overwatch,not_removed,try matching my win rate she is not easy unless you just get lucky just like any character good positioning understanding the map and having situational awareness are important getting a play of the game or wiping a stupid team doesnt make her easy to use i find that the kind of attitude that usually tells me i need to switch lacking an understanding of what im going to bring to the team
Overwatch,not_removed,there are other doors though
Overwatch,not_removed,this was mostly a sarcastic reply to all the symmetra mains that refuse to believe it can actually suck or feel bad playing against the character in general the most common thing i hear is its your fault for missing all your shots and its your fault for letting her get that close also see they look like shitty players
Overwatch,not_removed,thats not my point i think sym is a very good character actually this kind of strategy of attacking in spawn wouldnt work at higher than mid plat is what i mean at best she would get a little ult charge then die now leaving them at spawn and then running back to the door way to spam a few charge shots thats fine and you still have time to set up good turret placements after they destroy the turrets in spawn
Overwatch,not_removed,this shes too easy to counter by any ranged dps to be used in most locations for attack so the funs in attempting to control progression of the match and your opponents movement
Overwatch,not_removed,whatever her dmg is too strong dps is stupid for a support and her beam extents to meters ones it attaches thats half roadhogs hook
Overwatch,not_removed,i kinda think reapers mobility is garbage too though
Overwatch,not_removed,e rightclick waves
Overwatch,not_removed,she isnt completely overpowered no symm issues dont come from the completely part at all they come from the situational parts of the game where its impossible to escape death from her beam when it happens its no different than roadhog in terms of broken she needs an adjustment to her numbers the mechanics are fine imo but hp flying shield damage per tick at full charge that charges in secs even if she switch targets those are the situational moments where she is way too powerful lowering a bit the dmg making it reset when changing targets disconnecting it when around a corner lowering a bit the shield hp at least to winstons shield value imo it wouldnt hurt to remove the increase beam distance after connect that part is ridiculously bad make as long to connect as it is now after connecting it should be up to the symm player to be closer to the target when connecting to avoid an easy runaway that being part of a passive mechanic is skilless at least aggravating at most with the turrets fantastic support ults she wouldnt be in a bad spot at all if she couldnt kill half a team in secs of blindly running around holding left click but hey what do i know im an old guy with rather mediocre gaming skill cant be too many people like that right
Overwatch,not_removed,t w o p i c k r a t e
Overwatch,not_removed,exactly my point
Overwatch,not_removed,thats part of my point zone control is her strength its trade off is that it is situational and she should have a harder time than what i perceive she currently does succeeding when she cant use her full kit optimally like i said im not heavily implying that shes blatantly op in all situations but it seems to me it takes ways more effort to outplay her than it does for her to lock on and kill you
Overwatch,not_removed,heck when im junkrat ill run up to the enemy teams door prematch spam hello times lay a trap dead center and then place my spray on it out of times so far someone walks right over it
Overwatch,not_removed,it still amazes me that i kill two people almost every time we start hanamura and i put the traps right in front of the door the top of gibraltar used to be the same way but i guess most people dont use that exit anymore and widows apparently look before they exit to my disappointment
Overwatch,not_removed,sighthis is true
Overwatch,not_removed,i play junkrat on eichenwalde defense for this reason i lay a trap and mine in the little dip in ground outside the spawn or at the door itself they fall for it every time gets me at least one or two kills more if i start firing grenades at them i got a quad once time and you can have your tire ready in a few shots
Overwatch,not_removed,this trick still works to this day when will people learn
Overwatch,not_removed,i call it the idiot trap its almost always a solider zen or mccree that gets nuked
Overwatch,not_removed,i laid a trapmine surprise on the main ramp at the anubis attacker spawn yesterday one of the enemy said in all chat ooh a trap scary and i said nothing because i knew what came next a tasty double kill i rarely laugh out loud when im alone but i certainly couldnt keep that one in for long
Overwatch,not_removed,kegshooter here its not as easy as it seems i also have the responsibility of spamming hello my ultimate is charging hello
Overwatch,not_removed,i always go out that door for every reason you said i havent don out the main door in ages
Overwatch,not_removed,i appreciate that flair
Overwatch,not_removed,httpsgfycatcomdirectbravedormouse
Overwatch,not_removed,also once it is locked it will hit you even around a corner which just feels too op
Overwatch,not_removed,as someone who played her a ton before the change i argued for a few weeks that no she was not op just new and people would adjust well im changing my tune shes fucking op i have watcher her kill squishes in seconds without aiming over and over ive done it myself once shes at full charge the only thing thats stopping her from wiping a team is how much ammo is left in the gun as it stands her top end damage needs to drop by or the dropoff needs to change id bet having it drop off at would be enough so that at least a lucio at full run with speed boost can get away before she kills him to dead
Overwatch,not_removed,symmetras beam does not indeed slow anyone down its her turrets but you can shake them off by breathing on them
Overwatch,not_removed,symmetras main weapon absolutely do not slow you down it may feel that way though because you are slow when you walk backwards a lot of people seem to think walking backwards is as fast as walking forward and they dont notice that until they a reinhardt or symmetra
Overwatch,not_removed,my current ritual walk to the door use a sit emote and wait ive already seen everything get destroyed and it helps me clear my mind before the game still shoot the basketball though
Overwatch,not_removed,you couldve switched to winston for seconds to clear them if you see something do something
Overwatch,not_removed,theres a junkrat trap outside the main door someone still walks directly into it at the start and dies
Overwatch,not_removed,youre talking as if i dont already do that she can kill most of the roster in seconds and the beam curves around turns for a second before disconnecting i personally think that they should just get rid of the ability to remain fully torqued when switching beams between enemies i think if that wasnt a factor shed be fine
Overwatch,not_removed,its just that some people want ow to be an arena death match you know i absolutely love arena style overwath but that doesnt mean it has to be deathmatch or ignore objective it just mean that there are more skirmishes and more different pvp elements than you having to fight pve style vs turrets all the time slowly walking behind the shield just because it is more fast paced doesnt mean it requires less teamwork just different
Overwatch,not_removed,this is such a bullshit answer lmao the problem with sym is that she does some of the highest damage of any character in the game up close with an ability she doesnt need to aim and one of the smallest hitboxes out there which creates an infuriating situation whenever you die to it its like if valve buffed the pyros damage made his his hitbox the size of the scout increased his range let him shoot around walls and oh yeah he can also build a teleporter and place mini sentries and fire shields obviously thats a flawed comparison but its easy to see how that type of character in general is just un fun to play against insulting the playerbase is the same shitty argument as when that crappy godzilla movie came out a few years ago and whenever you insulted the horrible dialogue poor pacing and script that was written by a twelve year old people would dismiss your criticisms as oh you just wanted another transformers pfft you cant just ignore valid criticisms and blame it on some random other factor you pulled out of your ass thats a classic logical fallacy yo
Overwatch,not_removed,irrespective she got too much of a buff just like dva did just like bastion has she still would have been relevant if she didnt get all the changes she got shes not op but a tone down is warranted she might be relatively easy to counter isolated but in a team fight shes actually super good especially when shield gen is down that damage ramp just wastes symm mei is a ridiculous combo at the moment especially on defence
Overwatch,not_removed,inputting my thoughts as someone who has about hours on prerework symm and hours on postrework symm i think symm is fine its just people have to start treating her as a roadhog or mei they have a death zone near them engage her from afar additionally people hate her because she plays like sombra or mei she debuffs the enemy with her turrets and provides her team with essentially true vision of an area prerework id still get team kills its just that since she has some minor gun buffs and seen more light people are confused by this character who was seemingly useless she is a punishing character but an aggressive team punishes her also she doesnt do some of the highest damage in the game despite what people say its just a kneejerk reaction because most of the time symmetra simply outsmarts people and they fall for her trap they fear her and run while she has them locked on instead of fighting back there are some clear parallels between her and mei and roadhog
Overwatch,not_removed,thatd actually be great if they do away with the stack sym and torb only ctf sounds hilarious
Overwatch,not_removed,yep i know it well i was once a sym main theres a counter for winstonfull charge orb then hold left click but its hard to pull off if hes just leaping at you and doing hit and runs most of the time its down to whoever has the mostbetter health which is winston unless hes been damaged
Overwatch,not_removed,and then they all ragequit and leave her standing in a bookshop
Overwatch,not_removed,right there is a huge range of skill in the population symmetra is pretty broken at low levels of play you know the place where players are going to be lacking in gamesense
Overwatch,not_removed,heres the thing symetra should not be able to kill to players in a battle simply because she walked and danced around the action and charged up her damage on a roadhog and can then kill any mid health to low health character in a matter of seconds when i play against her if she links on to me i pretty much already accept my fate her reach shouldnt be so long and she should have a lower cap of damage she can charge up to
Overwatch,not_removed,the amount of skill needed to counter her is way higher than the amount needed to play her thats broken
Overwatch,not_removed,she doesnt need to aim and her hitbox is fucking tiny
Overwatch,not_removed,her hit box is way too small and she has a shield that you cant get around that basically makes it where you cant shoot her unless your pharah
Overwatch,not_removed,her counter is aim something not all people are good at neither pharah nor winston both heroes that are recommended against her can often be a poor fit against the enemy composition even with alternative exists the game is still built around chokepoints and some alternative exist arent that easily accessible like hanamura or eichenwalde
Overwatch,not_removed,while i agree her gun still needs los work when you escape symettras guns range you should probably be rewarded with the gun not arcing around corners or hitting you away for seconds genjis dash
Overwatch,not_removed,something a lot of people seem to struggle with apparently
Overwatch,not_removed,you could just shoot her from a distance shes powerful but i dont think shes broken at least i never had too much trouble with her
Overwatch,not_removed,okay her hitbox is as small as dva without a mech she doesnt need to aim and her design incentivizes bunnyhopping at close range this game doesnt handle closerange firefights very well in fact the lower your sens goes the harder it is to deal with something like that so what is the problem the problem is that once she locks on there is gloryfuckingnothing you can do unless you possess a movement or selfprotection ability each second literally shes locked onto you bunnyhopping around the earth and locked on shes dealing more damage in this sense fighting a symmetra is a fight on a timer that is consistently in symmetras favour not just because her hitbox is the size of a fireant but because she both doesnt have to aim and has increased damage over practically every hero in that style of matchup this is all excluding the turrets the teleporter the shield generator and the projected barrier i think those are just fine you can outplay those symmetras at master and above though theyre not going to stand out in the open and im sure its the same as low as platinum since symmetra doesnt exactly have a very low skill floor i dont think her damage is too big i think its too big for how hard she is to hit therefore significantly increasing her hitbox would be the best way to balance this character mei has the same type of design and her hitbox was made purposefully bigger to accomodate this reality
Overwatch,not_removed,i dont think shes broken shes just incredibly frustrating to die to because even with some heroes that have escape mechanics you usually die before you can get far away enough for the tether to break unless you move the second she locks on this goes for genjis dash and junkrats landmine launch for example both of which are efficient for getting away from almost any attack the fact that it is basically an aimbot doesnt help either
Overwatch,not_removed,by broken i mean her range is very glitchyfinnicky and is too long once it connects to you it will stretch outwards and bend around corners even if its at a range that could not lock onto you beforehand combine that with a very fast ttk for non tanksbastion and youve got yourself a frustrating support
Overwatch,not_removed,heroes can be broken in different ways unhealthy for the game lack of counterplay op literally breaking the game
Overwatch,not_removed,not really the term broken means literally that in some way a hero doesnt really function with the game broken characters may be overpowered underpowered or appropriately powered but not really work right in a game sense id argue that symmetra is badly designed rather than broken the real problem with her is her turrets torbs turret creates a single additional target for you to have to deal with symmetra however creates six and unlike torbs turret they can be placed in really weird places ie not on the ground moreover while both torb and symmetra can make their turrets better with time torb does it by enhancing his single point while symmetra does it by dropping a lot of turrets symmetras turrets have extremely varied value while torbs turret tends to be pretty constant in value while torbs turret can be used to flank you from a second direction symmetras turrets allow flanking from directions almost the opposite of where any enemy could be but if symmetras turrets arent wellhidden theyre basically garbage indeed their only real value is to be somewhere where they cant really be seen save from a fairly narrow fov which is where they attack conversely torbs turret if placed in a place where there is only a very narrow region to attack it from is also only capable of attacking a very narrow region which makes it worse symmetras turrets operate in the exact opposite way of torbjorn and are massively better in places where there is complex geometry on a relatively low ceiling or a doorway with a wall around it out on the street theyre basically useless symmetras turrets create an unfun game of find the stupid turret that is zapping me and make certain chokes vastly harder to get through while leaving others practically unaffected theres a huge amount of maptomap variation on the effectiveness of her turrets which makes her inconsistent and the overall gameplay effect of having to hunt for turrets in weird corners just isnt enjoyable her ability to create a teleportershield generator is likewise something of a game of hideandgoseek with a static object and serves as a distraction from the core gameplay of fighting as teams while in theory this is a neat idea in practice it generates the very undesirable scenario where the other team wants to hunt down your random static object which can be hidden in one of a fairly large number of places which makes it something of a guessing game and also puts too much emphasis on particular heroes especially sombra who is by far the best character at running around behind enemy lines and hunting down symmetras ultimate theres also the fact that it can create very swingy situations on attack if you rush forward then dump out a teleporter somewhere it can either cause you to have a ridiculous spawn advantage or on the other hand it can be destroyed quickly and then youre just sol i think that the things she actually personally does her moving shield her beam and her slowmovingbutbarrierpiercing shots are actually reasonably interesting but her whole builder side is illconsidered
Overwatch,not_removed,a support hero with one of the most elusive hitboxes ingame dealing damage per second by holding down at ridiculous ranges even able to put a moving shield in front of her rendering her temporarily invincible while chasing down her prey edit to clarify her beam prerework was fine because it was a tool of selfdefense but since they introduced the moving shield and buffed her range she is actually able to chase down enemies she rapes too many heroes in a without needing high skill at least ana needs to hit hitscan shots and her sleepdart which can be a bitch i think its viable for a support to have great defensive utility to have survivability lucio can escape ana can damage and selfheal forcing the enemy to retreat symmetra can run towards enemies and kill them by holding down
Overwatch,not_removed,seriously her gun becomes incredibly powerful over a very short space of time when you finish off one enemy and you lock onto another within a few seconds its still at almost max power the beam is difficult to escape as nearly every character most dont stand a chance and the ones that do its glitchy at best many times as pharah ive jumped up to escape and it stayed locked on lucio cant push her away tracer blinking backwards oftentimes doesnt work even when youre a long way from symmetra it can reach through walls and bend around corners the player doesnt event have to aim properly its a point click and look in the general direction of the enemy her shield regenerates very quickly making her very difficult to kill her hitbox is tiny most sym players hop around to avoid shots from midtolong range heroes people through the word broken out a lot especially in relation to overwatch but symmetra is definitely one of few characters that deserve the title i would have considered roadhogs old hook broken reaching incredible distances and through walls sound familiar
Overwatch,not_removed,how do you counter her with mercy
Overwatch,not_removed,
Overwatch,not_removed,read ferrets explanation above
Overwatch,not_removed,she can quite literally shoot through walls
Overwatch,not_removed,winston is in need of a little buff not too much or else we will have another unkillable dva on our hands
Overwatch,not_removed,that just isnt true balance is a big part of all levels of play
Overwatch,not_removed,what balance has influence over of the player ranks do you even listen to yourself
Overwatch,not_removed,tho sym does more damage
Overwatch,not_removed,the range is still bullshit for an autolocking weapon imo especially considering its damage
Overwatch,not_removed,which requires knowledge of flanking routes and other things or just watch a symm turret guide on youtube placing a turret doesnt require any mechanical skill so no practice needed
Overwatch,not_removed,this thread feels like roadhog hook was being defended instead of pointed out as broken all the hog fans making fun of the rest of the people because hog is easy to counter the current state of symmetra is what i call a balance slipperyslope
Overwatch,not_removed,oh ok i misread you yeah i did see a couple of they look like shitty players whats funnier is that the matchmaking system attempts to match players of similar skill as often as possible hell it even says so on the quick play button so they cant have been that much worse than op
Overwatch,not_removed,if you are actually playing competitive you will see that symmetras know what they are doing and dont just peek random shit maybe they do that in quickplay
Overwatch,not_removed,dont get within of her then and its only dps if its been attached to you for seconds
Overwatch,not_removed,reaper has major flanking ability on a lot of maps with shadow step and wraith form is often enough to get back to the safety of your healers if youre not getting caught too out of position shadow step in wraith form out and you should do well as him
Overwatch,not_removed,works especially great in that small room with the healthpack before the chokepoint in eichenwalde almost a guaranteed kill there
Overwatch,not_removed,last night i was checking for junkrat traps while on attack as mei nothing at spawn so i push through the chokepoint and duck down a side door go to exit the other sidetrapped mined dead kill cam showing junkrat miles off looking the wrong way as he kills me and im pretty good at avoiding this stuff which just makes it infuriating when i miss one and die from it
Overwatch,not_removed,i try to hide myself when i place a trap at the front gate so they cant see me place it so many times people dont notice unless they see you and if there are doors i spam into the one i dont want them to go through so they run into my trap and explosives then i immediately spam them to death
Overwatch,not_removed,i do both
Overwatch,not_removed,if i shoot the mine first ill purposefully walk into a spawn trap because giving my healers ult charge is worth giving junkrat ult charge
Overwatch,not_removed,hrm hrm sake sake hrm
Overwatch,not_removed,dont forget i need healing i need healing i need healing
Overwatch,not_removed,the world could always use more heroes
Overwatch,not_removed,whats really funny is that for volskaya the front door is the correct door to use but everybody always insists on putting themselves at risk of getting booped into the icy depths
Overwatch,not_removed,whats wrong with hanzo i really dont get it i can have four gold medals including objective time and still get called an asshole for picking hanzo i am better with hanzo at taking out pharah than i am with solider so why does everyone hate hanzo
Overwatch,not_removed,thanks what does yours mean
Overwatch,not_removed,lol dont even have to be on your screen d
Overwatch,not_removed,honestly her damage boost could just go away after killing someone and i wouldnt mind since right now its the best killstreak weapon in the game either that or the tracking needs to be toned down for sure though
Overwatch,not_removed,yea i was thinking the same as you that people just didnt wanna counter her or were used to her but jesus christ not only is it ridicolously hard to get rid of that stupid laser she also gets her ulti up almost instantly in any match she is in
Overwatch,not_removed,as it stands her top end damage needs to drop by or the dropoff needs to change id bet having it drop off at would be enough so that at least a lucio at full run with speed boost can get away before she kills him to dead if symmetra gets full power and latches onto a fullhealth pharah and pharah tries to jump jet to get away shell die before she gets out of range that seems very broken to me
Overwatch,not_removed,i dont think she is op she has meta counters its her primary fire that is not fun you have two scenarios she starts shooting you and you kill her which is fine but the damage you took from her feels un justified because she doesnt have to aim at you or she kills you and you watch the death cam and shes jumping around not aiming at you which feels worse
Overwatch,not_removed,i guess im just bad at aiming my breath then
Overwatch,not_removed,line up the shot carefully then your teammate shoots the ball out from you right as youre about to hit it
Overwatch,not_removed,
Overwatch,not_removed,good thing we had someone sacrifice himself so no one else can step into it what a guy
Overwatch,not_removed,as is tradition
Overwatch,not_removed,lol i always watch for junkrats to drop traps i try to shoot them but inevitably someone runs right into it
Overwatch,not_removed,okay but that would make symmetra less desirable in general the point of having a symmetra is the opponent team will think twice before randomly jumping into a capture point shes not that hard to take down first off its not like shes got amazing hp even after the shield generator and second the rest of her kit is weak on their own her turrets are one shot and her charged shot moves like a slug my point is this symmetra has a job and its to pick a small place and be able to defend that place by herself if she has to while supporting her teammates currently shes doing that job well if youre worried about her dont get near her similar to how you probably shouldnt stand in open space if theres a hanzo or widow on the opposing team you probably should keep your distance if you see a symm just because shes support doesnt mean she should be frail and easy to take care of
Overwatch,not_removed,edit bless whoever gilded this ive always tried to thoroughly explain my points and back everything up with statistical breakdowns but this is the first time one has actually been paid attention to let alone gilded thank you very much and thank you to all the posters supporting this it is greatly appreciated nbsp she does some of the highest damage of any character in the game up close lets break this down symmetra damage dps for second dps for second dps for second onwards damage resets after seconds without contact now that weve highlighted the fact that her damage has to take several seconds of uninterrupted attacking to reach full dps and resets at the same speed lets go ahead and continue with our symmetra running at her full dps symmetras dps can only be increased via buffs to her or debuffs to her target via abilities from other characters she is unable to cause critical hits she is also unable to hit more than one target at a time thus by herself her damage will never exceed dps she can only cause higher dps by being buffed or facing a debuffed target which is something that all characters can benefit from for that reason we can consider it irrelevant so weve got symmetra up to dps putting aside her need to ramp up and losing charge later now lets look at the other characters primary fire dps all figures correct as per the live game at the time of writing sombra mccree junkrat torbjörn tracer reaper pharah genji bastion hanzo mei widowmaker winston roadhog reinhardt dva zarya ana lúcio mercy zenyatta characters at their most base form do less damage than symmetras maximum and one ties as there are heroes currently that means symmetra is in terms of base dps even when we give her the benefit of ignoring her need to charge damage now lets be more fair and acknowledge that some of these characters can do more or less damage than their damage per primary fire shot divided by shots fired per second indicate genji dps comes purely from his primary shuriken fire and does not include swift strike deflect and melee attacks which many people would argue are just as vital parts of his damage potential as shurikens as such raw dps is largely irrelevant to him pharah comes only with direct hits given that the average accuracy for pharah is around on all platforms we must assume that of her shots can not achieve more than the maximum splash damage of this averages out to be dps zarya goes over dps from charge onward she can get over charge from almost any single attack on one of her bubbles so this is not unreasonable widowmaker assault rifle does dps significantly more than her primary sniper rifle also note that widowmakers sniper rifle carries with it a special bonus to critical hits unique to her mei meis primary fire is very clearly for utility not damage her icicle does damage and the combination of her attacks is made for easy critical hits bringing it up to on top of the the primary fire already dealt zenyatta obviously is intended to attach discord orb to any targets increasing both his and his allies dps on that target by mercy can increase allies dps by which in some cases does more damage than her own attacks her own dps doesnt increase but the overall damage the target receives does bastion can enter turret form which produces dps of winston reinhardt though both have very low dps both can hit all targets within their radius meaning their effective dps actually scales with how many targets they are facing for instance winstons dps is only when facing one target but he is effectively doing when facing two dps when attacking three etc so after all that pharah no longer ties with symmetra while several characters overtake her so symmetra is still at and pharah moves down or if were completely fair and add in things like widowmakers assault rifle and zarya at notunreasonable charge then symmetra also moves down the rankings by at least all other cases are more situational making symmetra out of — the lower half of the roster overall and again thats putting aside symmetras need to charge that damage up if you also average out her damage across her charge then of course she drops even further down this is also ignoring the many characters who can take advantage of critical hits to increase their dps symmetras slightly longerthanaverage reload time etc i would also argue that the idea that symmetra does not need to aim is rather moot given that winston reinhardt reaper dva torbjörn junkrat mei and zarya also all have attacks which largely just hit whatever is put in front of them dont tell me that reaper has to aim when hes just holding down primary fire spamming shotgun spread at everything on his screen nbsp youre also skipping over some other very important factors symmetras hitbox is only one of the smallest in the sense that theres nobody smaller but there are also several characters who are equally small mercy ana lúcio genji widowmaker dva on foot tracer and sombra take up the same total area zenyatta too though of course his is such a different shape that its hard to consider it remotely equal symmetras primary fire is one of the loudest and most visually distinct in the game so its incredibly hard for her to attack in any kind of stealthy way unless the target is incredibly oblivious as ops gif shows symmetras primary fire autotargets nonplayers first meaning objects like mines traps sentries turrets winstons shield and meis wall will all distract her beam forcing her to stop firing realign and fire again to damage a player symmetras primary fire has the shortest range of any gun in the entire game for initial lockon and the tiedsecondshortest range at full extension after lockon it starts at metres which is only beaten in shortness by reinhardts nongun attack at full extension it reaches metres beating winstons range by metres though his also hits in a metre wide radius and matching meis primary fire all hitscan weapons do not suffer damage reduction until well after this point — commonly around the metre mark — so they can all do their maximum damage at twice the range of symmetras initial range and further than her maximum range of course they can carry on doing damage at far greater distances with some not even reducing in damage until well past metres symmetra has no mobility options or abilities and no stealth abilities she has to close the gap to her target at the complete standard movement speed and has no way of escaping back out unlike many other shortrange characters eg reaper genji tracer etc symmetra has a damage pool of and shield giving her overall she has no selfheal beyond the standard shield functionality of seconds without damage to start regenerating — which is also the time itll take for her beam to power down — and no armour again this means she has to close the gap to her target at great risk and being forced to break off means starting her attack all over again nbsp so what have we established after all of this symmetra is a highly squishy very loud standardised target who does belowaverage dps at best and has to take great risks to do so the end result is that the only people who get melted by her are ones who do not pay attention if you got melted by symmetra — let alone if she microwaved your whole team — then all that means is that you or you all failed to kill a character who had absolutely zero advantages over you she cant attack silently she cant attack from safe ranges she cant get her damage up without targets being fully aware of it she cant chase anyone down she cant escape she cant stall or preserve herself in any way and she can only engage one enemy at a time nbsp finally i want to highlight something nobody thinks sombra does too much damage nobody is complaining about sombra melting their whole team and do you know which other hero is closest to sombra in terms of global average stats symmetra on all platforms theyre within fractions of a percent of each other in all their combat stats fractions of a percent can not be said to matter for all intents and purposes symmetra is performing equal to sombra sombra and thats with the added bonus that symmetra has of having her average eliminations bumped up by any target who is tagged by one of her sentries meaning that she is only equalling sombra with help but i bet you dont think sombra does too much damage
Overwatch,not_removed,with an ability she doesnt need to aim and one thats the problem right their imagine if dva had auto targeting guns
Overwatch,not_removed,you cant just ignore valid criticisms and blame it on some random other factor you pulled out of your ass thats a classic logical fallacy yo its not valid criticism do you symmetra dominating proplay is she a staple pick at high ranks in competitive queue no shes only a problem in lowtier games where people wont take the basic easy steps to play around her strengths did you play the game at release did you see how many people whined and raged that bastion was completely brokenop theyd walk in front of him and get instantly killed by his high dps was that not valid criticism that bastion could kill people so easily after a few weeks everyone learned to play around him just like you can do for symmetra and the vast majority of the player base realized he was weak theres a reason no successful game balances around the everchanging whims of belowaverage players
Overwatch,not_removed,un fun to play against but that doesnt make her op
Overwatch,not_removed,but keep in mind that on those levels of play people also lack the aim to shutdown phara which allows for easy countering sym and that the sym lacks the gamesense to be effective as well otherwise literally everyone could climb out of low ranks by just playing sym only
Overwatch,not_removed,im in bronze and on console she doesnt dominate dont assume
Overwatch,not_removed,piece of advice dont get fucking close to her thats your fault if you fuck up that badly youre supposed to die mimimi i walked in a straight line towards a widow and she killed mewidow op mimimi
Overwatch,not_removed,her hitbox is fucking tiny its the same as mercys widowmakers genjis tracers dvas on foot and its the same total area though a different shape of course as anas lúcios zenyattas and sombras if you can hit mercy you can hit symmetra also dont say she doesnt need to aim as if thats some unique trait to her and not something that reaper torbjörn dva mei zarya winston and reinhardt all benefit from too and arguably junkrat and then there are all the characters who barely need to aim like sombra tracer bastion and pharah who have weapons with such spreadsplash that hitting every single shot is not their intention anyway
Overwatch,not_removed,this right here trying to hit her with reaper any hitscan hogs right click after hook hanzo widow clever syms will have no issue with her really though is way harder since syms also latch onto you jump around like a cracked up kangaroo and will have max damage output in a few seconds splash damage from helix or pharah is the best solution because its spread out but not everyone has that sort of splash damage
Overwatch,not_removed,the shield moves pretty quickly and isnt very wide unless youre in a narrow corridor alone with symm its easy to side step and avoid her hitbox is small but she has to be very close to start doing damage so unless you cant aim at all or you let yourself get flanked you shouldnt have much trouble hitting her
Overwatch,not_removed,hrmjust play winston or tracer or phara hook her as hog etc also what the hell are you talking about with her shield iirc its a slowly moving plane getting around that is easy as long as you know your keybinding for moving in any direction her hitbox is fine you can just outright shit on her with characters which is more hardcounters than some other characters have and easily deal with her on at least or more
Overwatch,not_removed,and then you wait till the shield passes and she throws another ball at you so you throw a fat hook in her face
Overwatch,not_removed,no people assume her counter is aim it isnt that is making the mistake to assume that you have to kill someone to counter them her counter is dont play into her but rather play smart and deny her value also the enemy team can only have so many characters if they run a comp that supports a sym they cant deal with winston phara tracergenji if they run something that can deal with all of them while still having a symmetra they basically choose to play two entirely different playstyles and the sym should never become a problem to begin with
Overwatch,not_removed,that is actually a problem i agree but with this were not talking about balancing but rather fixing unintended behaviour
Overwatch,not_removed,exactly my point there are countless ways of dealing with sym
Overwatch,not_removed,her hitbox is as small as dva without a mech she has a bigger ass though
Overwatch,not_removed,a few more things i would like to see changed once she charged her attack it takes seconds to kill you as a squishie so my idea is she needs to recharge on every target from the beginning not just running lunatic and murders the whole team when winston loses his target out of los his gun stops docking on i wish symms weapon would work the same at least you can dance around her its just crazy that her deathlaserbeam almost never breaks not to mention it continues even if you are already in a room behind a wall or try to get away over a corner her beam could also be a bit downtuned it is way to long for a support hero
Overwatch,not_removed,i have never agreed with a comment more in my life season is my first season of overwatch and starting out from bronze and climbing up to diamond symmetra has always been a nuisance it hasnt changed yet and she puts too much pressure on the game for one hero you have to deal with her turrets her tele or shield gen and her have you fought a symmetra with a mercy nearby g fucking g i guess i could learn to get better at pharah but thats obnoxious that i need to play her frequently to deal with all of the syms she is too damn tiny for the damage shes outputting
Overwatch,not_removed,personally i would prefer if they increase the sound of her footsteps sometimes she just sneaks out of nowhere and latches onto me backlinehealer like a leech
Overwatch,not_removed,therefore significantly increasing her hitbox would be the best way to balance this character nah just make her beam consume more ammo per second when active right now symmetra can kill more enemies without reloading than any other character in the game
Overwatch,not_removed,so make symmetra fat
Overwatch,not_removed,not to mention that her huge beam range and damage often gets you even if you use an escape ability i cant count how many times ive jetted away as pharah and shes still on me at near max height around a wall on a different map
Overwatch,not_removed,as a symmetra main i have to agree with you on the hitboxbunnyhopping thing symmetra and mei are the two characters you never want to land in close quarters with but mei is significantly larger while symmetra is tracersized fwiw i dont particularly enjoy the bunny hopping part neither as the one doing jumping nor as the one being jumped around and i wouldnt mind if blizzard made it so that any skill use is interrupted by a jump that would be another way to make symmetra less infuriating to fight
Overwatch,not_removed,shes also very quick i tried to run as soldier and couldnt get away from that beam
Overwatch,not_removed,just to play devils advocate sizing up her hitbox while maintaining her current skillset would make her nonviable her relative agility is the only thing going for her since her threat radius is so small on any open map section eg shes prone to getting picked off by any range dps as is and using her shield as a escape mechanism only works on linear sections i do agree that the game isnt great at closequarters firefights so she has an edge there but thats the only time she has an edge and even then she has to close the gap to get in range and during that gap shes largely open popping the shield to provide cover for the gap leaves her open to other opponents when she engages her target so thats a limitation also given the hard counters available and the limitations of her play style i dont think shes broken in her current state the biggest problem players have when engaging her is acting on instinct eg everyone always runs directly backward from her esp when shes behind her shield disengaging on a tangent to her approach to get a clear los on her and more importantly moving away from your teammates would greatly limit the amount of damage she can put out before she goes squish just my
Overwatch,not_removed,you dont fucking symmetra simple as that either you gangbang her or you dont engage her and take a different route
Overwatch,not_removed,there is gloryfuckingnothing you can do unless you possess a movement or selfprotection ability lets go through this every hero in the game offense heroes literally every single one but mccree has a movement or selfprotection ability mccree can stun for free kill check defense heroes the snipers should never be close to symm obviously mei has two abilities to save herself and can trivially freeze sym junkrat can just concussive mine away torb and bastion will both easily win the if setup in sentry or have turret ready if they arent it will be hard but not impossible tanks dvawinston have movement zarya has a shield and easily gun her down roadhog can easily hook her reinhardt can literally spin in circles while swinging to trivially kill her supports who the fuck cares if a support is dueling enemy heroes they fucking should die that being said mercylucio have abilities that could let them escape ana has a chance at sleep dart too so what are we concerned about torbs who are caught without a turret zenyattas that get in close range to symmetra symmetra may do a lot of damage without aiming but she has no health no range and no movement so if she gets on top of squishes she can be a threat heres a pro tip if you dont have an ability that lets you easily ignore her stand behind your tanks who can all swat symmetra aside youll notice the group up heroes that cant deal with symmetra and heroes that should always be behind their tanks are identical
Overwatch,not_removed,worst thing is that it goes trough wall
Overwatch,not_removed,i remember a while back on route where sym for some reason was able to lock into me from outside but then continued locked on through a wall when i went through the dirt tunnel in the early part of the map through a walli was so damn annoyed cant stand characters that dont have to aim
Overwatch,not_removed,i see people run from sym pretty often as sym i can usually kill tanks on my own seems pretty unbalanced for a defensive support class
Overwatch,not_removed,to add her turrets are fine one shot one kill and they are destroyed her two ultimates are also fine its her gun that needs the nerf either fixing the reach the auto aim capabilities the rate at which it recharges
Overwatch,not_removed,the combination i might add of hopping around and not having to aim makes her extremely hard to hit small already moving erractically in way not many other characters are allowed since they have to aim too sym is one of the few things in this game i cannot at least get one good hit on most of the time i get lucky occasionally or unlucky depending on how you see it and get a good headshot which means im all the more frustrated when she inevitably kills me without even trying i think thats why so many people have such vehemence for her she seems like shes barely even paying attention to the game not even attempting to win just effortlessly teamwipes mei has a huge problem with this too easyfreeze easy headshot everyone but tanks are dead at least with mei theres a far greater chance of escape with some quick thinking with sym good fucking luck i got latched as pharah landing to grab a healthpack immediately used her boost got above a two story building and died still latched ever wanna get proper tilted have that happen ultimately i think a small tweak or two to her primary fire is all thats needed slightly less range maybe a fourth less damage and slightly less tracking and shell be golden itll make syms less likely to just blatantly flank and do the job of dpss without a second though and when a sym does attempt that itll make her a bit easier to counter for players without perfect aim or who dont have their movement ability at the ready speaking of most movement abilities dont let you escape sym mccree is actually the luckiest a simple flashbang is far more useful than a rocket jump or sprint
Overwatch,not_removed,you stand more than feet away she literally cant do a thing to you at more than meters and her ranged attack is slow as shit and youve no excuse to be hit by it if she puts up her shield and moves in turn around and move back sym demands space and you either give it to her and take an alternate route or she punishes you you wouldnt get that close to a mei so you shouldnt get that close to a sym
Overwatch,not_removed,thanks for the link but i dont agree with your points id have to see an ingame analysis proving that her hitbox is as small as pilot dva because i really dont think thats true in addition you compared her to mei but symmetra has less health than mei that balances her smaller hitbox just like it does for soldier and other dps characters
Overwatch,not_removed,she seems realy well balanced at higher elo imo although i understand with your explenations that she can be hard to deal with at lower level of play where people struggle with moving target and have less game senses
Overwatch,not_removed,which is not convincing at all
Overwatch,not_removed,he misspoke i think what i hope he means is that balance cant account for high and low levels of play at the same time blizzard has and will always chose the high levels of play for balance because they want to make an esport balancing for high level play also makes the already incredibly hard task of balancing the game easier because you eliminate the human aspect from the equation expecting players with high skill to play the heroes against each other
Overwatch,not_removed,good luck keeping the beam on a winston going in and out of his bubble he will out damage you unlike walls winstons bubble like reins shield stops the beam right away
Overwatch,not_removed,it requires psychology and a constant awareness of current opposing team comp and where they are likely to go based on who they are playing if you set turrets initially and never change youre a bad sym if you die to syms that do that youre just stupid
Overwatch,not_removed,xd its all good ive just been frustrated with certain people around here insisting that the detach range of the beam is totally okay the way it is despite loads of complaints and evidence that its pretty not cool
Overwatch,not_removed,but you know whats consistant between quick play and competitive people running off alone move with your team and keep pressure on the other team and symmetras usefulness takes a nosedive also stop ignoring her ult
Overwatch,not_removed,sorry could i get that in english peak random shit like httpwwwbeppegrilloitimmaginitavmerdajpg edit i appreciate your edit correcting peak to peek but i still dont know what it means
Overwatch,not_removed,not sure what rank you are lol but when youre pushing a choke or running around corners if she is there you are dead it is impossible to get away from her if you dont have your abilities and you have health or less
Overwatch,not_removed,as opposed to sym where your gap closer is to throw a giant glowing shield and run behind it straight at your opponent zero chance of not being spotted so you bunny hop and hope that you can kill somebody before you get mowed down
Overwatch,not_removed,people like you are the reason i have trust issues
Overwatch,not_removed,big or little pack
Overwatch,not_removed,well theres usually a bastion waiting to blast whoever walks into it if a rein steps into the mine junkrat nades bastion deployed and firing usually nets kills in the first few seconds especially if i also place a mine above the trap out of spawn view as soon as the trap fails everyone gets launched into the line of fire its not backfired yet the worst that happens is the mine trap gets blown by a minejumping junkrat
Overwatch,not_removed,and thats when the grenades come raining in to finish you off i caught me a varmint
Overwatch,not_removed,getting practice for genii eh
Overwatch,not_removed,woooaaaahh
Overwatch,not_removed,because he has an extremely high skill floor and most players dont play him to a useful potential even besides that the fact that he operates further back in a game that requires players to often be in close proximity to an objective means that typically hanzo and widow wont be adding their presence to the objective directly even if they are managing to contribute a great deal it just gives the impression that theyre not
Overwatch,not_removed,people dont hate hanzo people hate hanzo players
Overwatch,not_removed,people like to blame something else for losing even before they lose they have played games where hanzo isnt helping because there are a fair amount of people who just pick hanzo no matter what and dont play as a team that frustration comes out later
Overwatch,not_removed,that was just a reference to a httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvrmditownsu by dinoflask on youtube
Overwatch,not_removed,hes just usually too unreliable
Overwatch,not_removed,i ran a win rate with hanzo last season people still bitched every time i picked it
Overwatch,not_removed,hanzo is a hero with insane amount of skill required statistically most people are shit with hanzo so its safe to assume that anyone that picks hanzo is likely not gonna be good of course its not but hanzo is a hero only useful for premades otherwise you can never know whether he is gonna be good or bad its not the hero its the player
Overwatch,not_removed,idk this sub just has a hate boner for him and genji since release
Overwatch,not_removed,because im a pharrah main that plays support in of matches because we already have a soldier genji and hanzo if it makes you feel better i hate the other two guys as well
Overwatch,not_removed,because of the people playing him are garbage if you cant play him at a high level youre a waste of a valuable team slot and free ult charge for the enemy
Overwatch,not_removed,its zaryas voice line together we are strong in russian
Overwatch,not_removed,the only side of the screen that it goes off of is the bottom and when you compare it to the distance from the crosshairs to the leftright side of the screen doesnt seem farther symmetras strong now but i really dont see her doing anything like prenerf genji and her pick rate while definitely higher still doesnt top the charts like a bunch of heroes she can do very well in quickplay or when the enemy team doesnt try to adjust for it but in hightier and tournament play is generally countered or requires appropriate teammates to work
Overwatch,not_removed,i think the damage ramp is fun but it should be harder to maintain reducing the tracking on the beam would definitely help make the ramp harder to maintain
Overwatch,not_removed,yeah she has way too much range even at the height of pharahs jump jet symmetra can still damage you for a short amount of time
Overwatch,not_removed,you just need to breathe harder hyperventilate or something
Overwatch,not_removed,thats when you switch from healer to hanzo to assert dominance over those dpsplebeians
Overwatch,not_removed,i understand that but i still think that beam should be nerfed its literally the equivalent of winstons i think the beam upkeep between enemies should still be nerfed
Overwatch,not_removed,why is this downvoted its true i just guess some people dont mind their distance from a symm and get salty about their misplays
Overwatch,not_removed,shame i had to go so far into the nested comments to find one of this quality i hope this gets noticed
Overwatch,not_removed,thank you tons for getting into all this data its hard to quantify for nonsymmetra players how her rework has made her more viable and not op playing her well involves a lot of strategic planning and forethought to your opponents actions but all most people experience are when her planned strategies work out well so instead they blame her for being overtuned when better team synergy would have negated her attacks more competently they dont see the times when she gets countered hard or when the enemy team is better coordinated than her own its an easy scapegoat to just chalk it up to her damage output and not consider that your own gameplay and strategy might have been lacking
Overwatch,not_removed,that i have only one upvote to give to this incredibly wellreasoned post too bad it wont shut up idiots crying about symm v
Overwatch,not_removed,just want you to know i love you symmetra has been my favorite since the game came out so ive worked hard to learn how to use her well and it was made much better by the changes letting me use her in more situations as a result of lots of practice i dominate with her its so frustrating when people scream no skill no aim nerf her blah blah blah when she isnt overpowered us symmetra people are just good at what we do but we struggle and have bad games just like any other character and are forced to switch when it isnt working anyway youre a good guy id suck your dick no homo
Overwatch,not_removed,im a bot bleep bloop someone has linked to this thread from another place on reddit footerif you follow any of the above links please respect the rules of reddit and dont vote in the other threads rtotesmessenger messagecomposetortotesmessenger bot
Overwatch,not_removed,am i aloud to send this to people that are ignorant of symmetra
Overwatch,not_removed,httpwwwreactiongifscomrmsygif
Overwatch,not_removed,
Overwatch,not_removed,very informative can you also factor in her turrets and alternate fire
Overwatch,not_removed,all of your dps figures are assuming all shots hit with other dps characters thats a difficult thing with symettra its a guarantee along with her slowing you down while she attacks
Overwatch,not_removed,honestly i dont think any hero should have auto aim guns
Overwatch,not_removed,so every rank below gm is low rank or because i still see her in masters and shes still really easy to play and ridicolously annoying only in tho to be fair or first point on hybrid maps
Overwatch,not_removed,yeah im not even that great of a player but i was so confused by the calls for bastions nerf i think after playing against him in beta its easy to see why hes so weak hes only ever op when someone knows how to surprise flank with him and those are always incredibly risky time consuming plays that hamstring the rest of the team i dont think his incoming buffs are very good ideas but hes one of the weaker damage dealers right now sym is similarly still hard to justify beyond gimmicks like this one in low ranksqp because she weakens a teams attack and support in exchange for marginal utility once either of these characters goes down theyre pretty much best off switching to a different hero
Overwatch,not_removed,i dunno ive seen a huge range of skill even at the low levels of play there are definitely people there that should be higher up in the ranks symmetra is still situational enough that i imagine it would be hard to climb by just playing her she feels like bastion used to feel very hard for lowlevel players to counter but also a hard character to climb with you might climb a bit but then if you hit a team that knows how to counter the character you cant really do anything in my experience most teams in high silver low gold know how to counter a pharah and shes usually seen as a highpriority target
Overwatch,not_removed,im in silver and on pc and shes pretty strong
Overwatch,not_removed,you really think it is that easy to avoid her this game has many choke points that you must go through which means that you cant avoid a symmetra i suppose you would think that anyway considering it seems like you main one of her hard counters
Overwatch,not_removed,most of those characters at least kind of need to aim you can move in a way that interrupts their flow of damage symmetra does not need to aim the damage does not stop you either have an escape or you die
Overwatch,not_removed,the real problem is it being pretty much impossible to escape from her leftclick unless you are one of a few characters and have your oh shit button up
Overwatch,not_removed,very close isnt that close at all
Overwatch,not_removed,the problem is im also avoiding a half dozen other things at the same time shes got turrets to the left theres a soldier to the right roadhogs got his hook ready for me i swear i heard mei giggle and now ive gotten slept by ana by the time i navigate all of that chaos symmetras standing feet from me and hopping around while microwaving my insides i cant get turned to actually shoot her nor can i run away fast enough to avoid dying adding the extra length to her weapons leash was kind of nuts
Overwatch,not_removed,its meters that basically becomes and there are hundreds of corners she can sit behind for an easy free kill
Overwatch,not_removed,winston sym outdamages winston winstons only purpose against her is destroying her turrets
Overwatch,not_removed,you cant wait for it to pass as she is dead behind it if you wait for it to pass she is killing you already
Overwatch,not_removed,what you are describing is a dive comp and yes symm before she can place a generator can be weak to dive comps but hey those are much harder to execute and play than symm on defense the maps in overwatch necessitate playing into symm because they are chockepoint based some maps dont have easily accessible alternative routes
Overwatch,not_removed,enemy team has one hitscan and you cant play pharah they can have a hitscan and a sym same with a reaper and a sym you dont need to build an entire team around symetra you can cover your bases and still have her hopping around casually teamkilling
Overwatch,not_removed,symm is a hard counter to genji fyi and pretty decent against tracer
Overwatch,not_removed,it unbalances symettra by increasing her potential output shes stronger than normal against heroes with escapes
Overwatch,not_removed,she sure does
Overwatch,not_removed,yeah it surprises me that theres so much hate for roadhogs hook and yet nobody talks about how her beam takes a while to break even after turning a corner and at full charge thats damage per second that short period after turning a corner that the beam retains contact will kill most heroes she had previous engaged
Overwatch,not_removed,oh and according to the website overbuff symmetra has a win rate in comp and win rate in quickplay
Overwatch,not_removed,yeah and at that point even if she dies trading for a healer is a huge benefit for symmetra she can literally sac all she likes because shes farming ult for free most likely getting at least one pick and denying your team of a fair push
Overwatch,not_removed,maybe give her some hardlight armour or something along those lines i dont really know
Overwatch,not_removed,her relative agility is the only thing going for her since her threat radius is so small thats fine she shouldnt duelling that shouldnt be her purpose her primary fire was clearly initially designed as a panic tool to defend herself with but turned out to be one of the deadliest weapons at close range that is unnecessary symmetra has two separate tools to farm ult with and she has more than enough space in every map to maintain distance just like every other support does but thats the only time she has an edge there is never a time when symmetra doesnt have an edge her hitbox is tiny shes hard to hit from afar shes lanky and any bit of health she loses she will recover passively which technically makes her harder to frag than all other heroes without armour or shields so basically everyone thats not a tank im purposefully leaving out the additional shields from the generator here to be generous at this point i think i just want to be thankful that the designers didnt give her ult charge for regening her own health and even then she has to close the gap to get in range nah this is false she shines on defense where the enemy has to close the distance not her they have to come through not her given the hard counters available there are no hard counters there are soft counters being hit with a rocket from meters away is not a hard counter thats something all heroes suffer from edit aaaaand there it is the passiveaggressive downvote i was wondering when op would start dishing those out a closet main who wants to silence any and all criticism for the character lost all semblance of respect from me right there
Overwatch,not_removed,yep no aim should be given low damage that gun should do winston damage or lower
Overwatch,not_removed,ive started saying she is pretty much every hero class at this point insane dps plus moving shieldoffence turrets plus deployable shielddefense deployable shield plus moving shieldtank supportdeployable shiield
Overwatch,not_removed,you said it i main mccree and im forever grateful for his flashbang when symmetra is close by
Overwatch,not_removed,while i love arguing about sym you do raise the fairest point in her favor so im only being pedantic when i say that feet meters
Overwatch,not_removed,she started the match less than meters away because sym was hiding around the spawn room corner as soon as she walked out the doors she was getting attacked by sym and slowed by her turrets im not saying she did an intelligent play or anything here but once symmetra has you in her sights as a low mobility hero youre on a very fast countdown to kill her before she kills you and a charge zarya does not have the reliable damage to win that edit whoops i replied to this thinking it was to a completely different post nevermind im an idiot to the comment that you actually wrote thats not really what id consider countering her in the traditional sense thats just avoiding her
Overwatch,not_removed,but symmetra has less health than mei that balances her smaller hitbox no it doesnt if it did then youd be agreeing that she is broken if her shield projector is online or if she had torbjörn armour as for the rest of your points i really just think youre being pedantic even if symmetras hitbox is wider than dvas the obvious point is that its tiny and hard to hit at deadzone
Overwatch,not_removed,i think the game needs to be really careful about balancing for the high tiers the bread and butter of this game is its low tier players i think it is a much better idea to have heroes that arent versatile enough to compete at the highest level than to have heroes that dominate low levels with ease
Overwatch,not_removed,a hero requiring higher tier elo for it to be balanced says a lot right there and thats not a good thing
Overwatch,not_removed,not sure if youre making a veiled assumption of me being a low elo player im not a low elo player
Overwatch,not_removed,what do we count as higher elo tho since shes still super oppresive on maps and some first point hybrid maps in masters
Overwatch,not_removed,you from the linked post grow the fuck up you need to be a little nicer
Overwatch,not_removed,peeking is looking over or around an object when you are aware that a longranged character might be looking in that direction so for example if you know theres a widowmaker looking around a corner to see if you spot her is peeking her which is generally a pretty stupid idea what tigersleep was saying is that after certain skill tiers symmetra and indeed most characters stop peeking so your assertion that quote shes too easy to counter by any ranged dps doesnt really make sense of course shes not she should be nowhere near longrange dpss line of sight because she doesnt even need to be in order to be effective
Overwatch,not_removed,you know what i mean it was a mistake i know its rough that you cant get out of bronze but please it is clear to see that you are playing againts a bunch of shitters in that video
Overwatch,not_removed,yeah with no cooldowns available its pretty hard to deal but then its just as hard to deal with dvareapermei if youre squishy and in their range youre hosed
Overwatch,not_removed,best part is when they fall for it twice in the same or another healthpack location easy way to get somebody tilted and start tunnel visioning you d
Overwatch,not_removed,im picturing that statement coming from mercy and directed at junkrat works pretty well
Overwatch,not_removed,big pack
Overwatch,not_removed,well he can operate further back but the distance where hes the most effective is about the same as soldiers due to the path and speed of his arrows from my experience im only in the far backline if the enemy is clumped together so that its hard to miss my shots and we have a midfront line dps already otherwise im about meters from my targets when possible
Overwatch,not_removed,i agree with what youre saying about hanzos skill level except so its safe to assume that anyone that picks hanzo is likely not gonna be good as someone who has almost hours on hanzo times as much as my most played it really sucks to hear views like that i almost never get bitched at for being hanzo by the end of a game but at the start of most matches i have to start with a respect of zero and work my way up but hanzo is a hero only useful for premades otherwise you can never know whether he is gonna be good or bad and to be honest i do mostly play with premades but i like to sometimes hop into solo quickplay and play hanzo why should that not be okay because my team wont know if im good or bad well guess what theres lots of other people out there playing characters theyre good or bad at and youll never know until playing with them if i join as a mccree you bet your ass im gonna do jackshit but is that better just cause people respect the hero more and assume ill be better cause that just goes right against what you said its not the hero its the player then let the player prove themself if its not the hero none of what youre saying makes sense since there should be no reason the players not gonna be good for picking him or that hes only useful for premades
Overwatch,not_removed,oh cool
Overwatch,not_removed,technically its together we are strength сила is a noun rather than an adjective
Overwatch,not_removed,honest question what is the counter for her my friends and i just get steamrolled by her on a regular basis and we havent really found a reliable counter for her outside of pure luck
Overwatch,not_removed,would increasing ammo consumption be a good thingwould give heroes more room to react or survive and makes her less of a menace
Overwatch,not_removed,what you werent hanzo already filthy casual
Overwatch,not_removed,it does get pretty crazy admittedly maybe a small nerf
Overwatch,not_removed,people dont like it when you disprove their wild assumptions with actual facts why accept that a character doesnt do as much damage as you incorrectly thought they did when you can just silently downvote instead you should see the mess that happens any time someone on the battlenet boards complains about pharah always winning and then they get shown her actual winrate
Overwatch,not_removed,its not true you are auditing all the good things about symmetra and just including a biased opinion on why you think shes bad without providing any context to why she is good or strong you act like these are facts you are providing but you literally are stating things that arent true
Overwatch,not_removed,its probably because even though this is all true it is all in a vacuum it doesnt take into account everything else symmetra can do nor do they take into account the fact that because she needs to get relatively close to the target which is often quite easy considering the large amount of choke points in this game she is incredibly difficult to hit if she just starts jumping around you and unlike other heroes that have the same hitbox symmetra does not have to aim which means that her dps will be constant it also doesnt mention that not only does it shoot through walls for a short amount of time some hero abilities that should allow them to escape do not work effectively now that her range has been significantly increased such as lucios boop which will very rarely push a symmetra back far enough if she is chasing you even if you have your speed boost active
Overwatch,not_removed,go for it ive been making similar posts in damn near every sym thread on the battlenet boards for the last couple of months but few people take any notice but hey cant hurt to keep trying
Overwatch,not_removed,for secondary fire see my reply to freelancefox if you can get the timing right secondary fire allows up to a damage spike to the first second but it is not damage per second as it takes too long to recharge its also not a trick you want to try in long engagements because the time it takes and the ammo it uses it no efficient youre better off just using primary fire sentries simply do dps and you can have a maximum of of them so simply add dps to her damage for every sentry you think there is if theres just one sentry on the target then her dps is not including the time to charge up her primary fire of course if you get all sentries on one target then thats damage just for those plus her for dps but again that ignores her chargeup time if shes starting from the base then of course all those numbers go down in the time it takes symmetra to reach full charge shell do damage in the first second and in the second uh second and the sentries will have done damage each x seconds meaning a minimum of damage for an uncharged symmetra one sentry across two seconds dps but just for fun lets say she has her primary fully charged lands an opening spike with a fully charged secondary and they have all sentries on them that would be damage in one second this places her just below bastions turret form hanzos full scatter arrow tracers ult a maximum roadhog hook headshot combo and well above a widowmaker headshot but good luck ever landing that combo
Overwatch,not_removed,along with her slowing you down while she attacks her beam does not slow you down her sentries do if youve walked into a full sentry nest and symmetras own beam then you deserve to get melted also considering the ranges involved a soldier tracer reaper etc should be hitting their target enough to make up of their damage at which point they still outdamage symmetra several characters can miss half their shots and still equal symmetra in damage and do so at longer range and with much lower risk to themselves i refer you again to the average combat stats of symmetra who is only equalling sombra including her sentry turrets the fact that weak sombra can miss a lot of her shots with her huge spray and symmetra still only equals her should tell you that no even though symmetras damage is more guaranteed it is in no way more significant than other characters damage output other people do miss a whole lot more and still do more damage than her so
Overwatch,not_removed,did you read the rest for her to get any sort of dps she has to be in their face with little health no defense and no escape measures
Overwatch,not_removed,see her ever staple pick i see her at gm and i even see her do well sometimes but shes not oppressive or common there is no symmetra meta just some players who like symmetra
Overwatch,not_removed,there are definitely people there that should be higher up in the ranks the problem is that rank is largely determined by pure mechanical skill rather than gamesense or meta knowledge up until plat or even diamond mechanical skill can certainly carry you pretty high higher than you deserve without developing much game sense or any meta knowledge which leads to a very mixed level of awareness at any rank lower than diamondmaster
Overwatch,not_removed,i dont think its easy to avoid her thats a fucking fact otherwise everyone would be running her all the time please learn to play the fucking game use google read the most basic gameplay guide symmetra has a hardcounter every non braindead player should be able to pull of basic gamesense and smart play or just play any out of the following heroes and dont be braindead winston zarya tracer phara genji mei roadhog dva hell even widowhanzo sorry to burst your bubble but if you have struggle dealing with a sym youre just a pretty shitty player
Overwatch,not_removed,move to her side and her attack breaks basic circle strafing murders symmetras ability to kerp her beam on you unless the player has a helluva lot of mouse mat and high sensitivity or maxed sensitivity in the case of consoles
Overwatch,not_removed,shes currently not designed to be escaped from which people somehow still havent learned yet after a season you need to engage her unless you have really good mobility like genjitracerwinstondva even amped lucio isnt guaranteed
Overwatch,not_removed,sounds like you more problems than symmetra that game
Overwatch,not_removed,yeah sym doesnt seem like the problem here
Overwatch,not_removed,but youre not alone either you have people with you unless youre a pro genji who only believes in you usually have a tank you can hide behind at least one person who can stunsleepfreeze symmetra a soldier who can chase her off or a widow behind wholl oneshot her before she microwaves anyone teamwork is one of her biggest counters unless your entire team is actively avoiding her in favor of spraying reins shield or tickling enemy widow from afar but then nothing can help you anyway
Overwatch,not_removed,sounds like your gamesense is crap then tbh if she hides behind a corner you can just easily avoid her if she fights your team out in the open go for something that counters her loosing to a symmetra is on the players fighting her you dont complain about taking a lot of damage from reaper when you walk right into his shotguns do you most fights are fought on medium distance which is outside of syms beam range so the only way you should end up in her beam is if a fight is lost and her team is just cleaning up or if you are playing a flanker and if you are playing a flanker but arent good enough on them to deal with a symmetra you honestly shouldnt play a flanker
Overwatch,not_removed,in less than a few seconds with her auto lock beam
Overwatch,not_removed,thats as if youre implying shes going to run into an entire team with the barrier and laser shes good at but thats about it and holding chokes mei is a waaaay better choke holder than symmetra is and she does decent damage at range you dont engage her unless youre confident you can kill her like a roadhog can you dont enter a deathroom unless you can clear it really fast or just poke inside kill turrets and get out heal up and go back in every hero in this game can reliably kill her even a mercy can if she gets headshots before the beam kills her
Overwatch,not_removed,you can counter dive with sym on your team have her set up turrets on flank routes for genjitracer and not at choke is step step is mccree and road hog which fit perfectly step is ana and zarya zarya just keeps her bubbles on ana while mccree uses hog as walking cover step is either another close range dos like reaper or another tank like even dva to beat winstonenemy dva step is symmetra stays out of main and wide open areas and sticks to her corridors and has her team call out winston the only part of five that can kill her when in said corridors actually done
Overwatch,not_removed,the thing is you dont even have to execute a dive comp properly to deal with sym as long as you go in fast and collaps on the sym first youre gonna win if you let her get her ultimate that means you already made some big mistakes to begin with ie heavy feeding before your first push but basically you can pick dive heroes without playing them as a dive comp as long as you are not walking through the choke slowly youre good
Overwatch,not_removed,please tell me youre kidding please tell me youre kidding if the enemy team has a single soldiermccree and expects him to shut me down on phara im having a field day if you get killed on phara by a single hitscan you should honestly learn to play phara properly because you are doing something seriously wrong
Overwatch,not_removed,uhm tracer is one of the best counters to sym its a huge missconception that its the other way around and sym and genji are not counters to each other in any way is sym very far away from hard countering genji hes a hero with a lot of mobilityone of the best ways to deal with sym
Overwatch,not_removed,decent against tracer lol hell no i main tracer and maybe if you mean the turrets slowing her down for a few seconds she can easily get away from death beam and she can destroy the shield generator and teleport easy with her ult
Overwatch,not_removed,pretty decent against tracer not against a decent tracer you can easily stay out of her range
Overwatch,not_removed,its still a bugunintended behavior sure its a bug fix that impacts the balance but more as a side effect
Overwatch,not_removed,yeah it remains locked on for half a second after losing los which is ticks of damage for damage total so basically if you cant escape engagement range or break los within second a full charge sym will kill any health hero seconds from a zero charge sym
Overwatch,not_removed,speaking of delay i would also like to know why zaryas left click has a massive amount of damage delay you can see it catch up when someone who has like left dies super fast as it retrospectively applies damage yet symmetras damage seems to apply smoothly and without large amounts of delay to my knowledge
Overwatch,not_removed,yeah the los is a major concern with her lmb if youre playing mei and she is locked onto you you can toss a wall up in front of her but her beam is still locked onto you through the wall but it will eventually fall off im assuming that winstons lmb automatically target the wall if this were to occur
Overwatch,not_removed,symmetras winrate has always been inflated its cant be trusted even back when she was considered useless she had the highest winrate in the game because if a team lost point a they switched off symmetra
Overwatch,not_removed,symmetras winrate is inflated because most syms will swap off the hero after the first point is taken which changes the winrate
Overwatch,not_removed,i fucking love you dude youre right about everything you wrote especially in fact that symmetras role is not a duelist people should compare her skills with other supports not with fucking soldiers and specialized fighters yes she should be able to defend herself no she shouldnt be able to jump around like a hamster slaughtering everything in seconds no limits mode is basically broken now out of games i played of them had full team of symmetras and yes sometimes we won but its so damn antifun to play against
Overwatch,not_removed,as a former symmetra main your posts are on point
Overwatch,not_removed,even winston doesnt hard counter her anymore unless your first push is successful shell have shieldgen up and will outdmg you
Overwatch,not_removed,or lower yeah no for a character that is as squishy as symmetra the damage is fine
Overwatch,not_removed,meanwhile im often fillpicking so a tank that cant hit hardaccurate enough and stupidly missing charges as rein when i should just be slapping her or a healer while my dps and tank ignore me i got lucky once and bopped a stupid sym off gibraltar once and im getting sleep darts down but mostly i just die pathetically i envy you dps mains xp also i dont recall how but theres a way to make the full face show up instead of getting smaller and missing an eye formatting is weird yo
Overwatch,not_removed,avoiding her makes her useless though and thats countering her if you take the path she hasnt put her turrets and if you never go into a fight with her alone she cant do much at all if shes outside your spawn then you along with the rest of your team should annihilate her instantly zero mobility heros shouldnt be in a position to be caught out by a symettra alone people like zen or mccree should always be with the team if you make her set up and her as a pick useless she has effectively been countered
Overwatch,not_removed,avoiding her is her counter tho symmetra needs to get her ult fast to get any value if you avoid her and kill the rest of her team she doesnt get ult charge therefore doesnt provide anything for her team countering someone can just as well mean to deny them value rather than killing them
Overwatch,not_removed,no it doesnt if it did then youd be agreeing that she is broken if her shield projector is online or if she had torbjörn armour what but her shield projector applies to all heroes so if her shields online yes symmetra has more shields but so does mei and everyone else on her team same for torb armor he can give armor to anyone and everyone if youre saying that syms shields and torbs armor are both broken then thats an entirely different argument perhaps its a discussion worth having but dont just throw that in as if its some advantage that only symmetra has and other heroes dont and why is it pedantic to point out that your assertion about the hitbox is incorrect what if it is wider what if its or at what point does it stop being pedantic and start being relevant if we stick to the facts and drop the assertions we dont have to play that game
Overwatch,not_removed,i mean pharah and tracergenji have the same relation with playing them versus playing their counter and no one is whining about them but yeah not so fair for new players i agree
Overwatch,not_removed,no im not just saying i dont seem to find people complaining about her at higher elo at least in my games i think she have clear counterplay and that unless its a qp or a low elo game she realy isnt as strong as people here picture her given that this sub doesnt have a high average sr i understand the complain tho even if i disagree
Overwatch,not_removed,shes a damn support you shouldnt be insta dead just because she gets near you with her stupid gun
Overwatch,not_removed,ah and when they start tunnelling you they never notice the extra trap i set up for them the moment this confrontation begun to play junkrat is to play with planning and intelligence even if it doesnt look like it
Overwatch,not_removed,you cant change what people think of hanzos out there are bad they cant do anything and even if they play as the worst mccree they would contribute more hanzo and sombra are heroes that require a lot of skill in most games you dont know whether someone is gonna have that skill which is why most people play it safe assuming that every hanzo is a bad hanzo if one in every ten taco you eat was filled with rotten vegetables youd likely stop eating tacos because you dont know whether they are rotten or not same with hanzo
Overwatch,not_removed,i know its just when you translate it to english together we are strong makes more sense
Overwatch,not_removed,well in my limited experience pharah although if theres a torbjorn or a bastion life will get a lot harder a wellplaced roadhog hook the universal counter winston ha yeah those were the days a good sniper if you have one i still think shes broken though its just not fun playing squishy characters like genji or lucio running down the wrong hallway and then oh hello symmetra i guess i lose now people always say group up but thats not always possible and it doesnt make her fair
Overwatch,not_removed,you want to press height and range advantage against symmetra so snipers and genji generally do well ive found and of course being a base health hero she is vulnerable to roadhog theres a lot of heroes that are good at clearing her turrets just make them priority before she gets good charge from them also i like junkrat if they try to hole up in a room
Overwatch,not_removed,thats a good idea too
Overwatch,not_removed,some hero abilities that should allow them to escape do not work effectively now that her range has been significantly increased you are aware yes that her actual max range was not changed only her latch range she always had meter max range it was the range at which she could latch that was increased this is why symm mains are so fucking annoyed with idiotic whining about her because its so full of complete and utter inaccuracies
Overwatch,not_removed,she has a shield and isnt slow at all she can jump around all willy nilly with really small hit boxes she also has regenerating health i think you also miss that she isnt supposed to be a dps if she flanks you theres little chance of escaping her beam id much rather one v one a mei for christ sakes
Overwatch,not_removed,idk if i see her everytime there is a map that would mean shes a staple pick in masters on maps
Overwatch,not_removed,im a support main i just try to keep my team up and not die there are a lot of ways for me to die
Overwatch,not_removed,heres what you basicly said anyone can kill sym if they get perfect headshots every single time thats dumb one because sym doesnt need to do that to kill you two not even pros are going to get headshots
Overwatch,not_removed,actually one of my favorite plays is on volskaya defense i wait until the opposing tank runs through the first choke and run past them on the other side of the truck throw a shield and mop up the dps and supports hugging the wall back there
Overwatch,not_removed,i dont think you understand what we are talking about what do you do when hp hero attacks you what do you do if the beam is on you right now moving fast through the choke doesnt make her go away no
Overwatch,not_removed,sym is the literal definition of a hard counter to genji genjis e is useless hes squishy if he dashes in he has to aim to kill her which you just argued isnt a counter to sym so which is it is aim a counter or not because you just finished arguing the opposite and yes symm is decent against tracer much like why winston is unless you mean to say yet again aim is a counter to sym
Overwatch,not_removed,tracers blink is is symmetras beam is once tethered so its not that simple its the same reason why winston is considered a tracer counter though his beam is shorter though winston also has a shield yet again so does symmetra
Overwatch,not_removed,this has killed me countless times as ana everyone says soldier has the aimbot but sym actually does
Overwatch,not_removed,they fixed that a while back
Overwatch,not_removed,even now most people only play her on point a defense so the stats are definitely inflated especially since defense in general has a higher win rate from what ive experienced if she was picked equally across all game modes like most other heroes her winrate would be much lower
Overwatch,not_removed,thats just because shield gens stack its not op because of symmetra its op because of symmetras with health
Overwatch,not_removed,its worst on mondays later in the week it isnt as bad once people have their three loot crates they switch to characters that are more fun to play i suspect that if they end up on attack they just quit and send the match back to skirmish mode very frustrating
Overwatch,not_removed,spot on i can recall leaping onto a point with people contesting it including a roadhog and slaying all of them as symmetra by bunnyhopping around the point which is ridiculous for a support role at this point are we sure shes not the offense and sombras not the support
Overwatch,not_removed,as much as i love her visual design her actress her story and everything about her characterization symmetra as a playable character has always been such a misguidedly designed character i get the feeling the designer in charge of her just had no idea what they wanted her to do sometimes ideas look better on paper any good designer needs to be able to filter these
Overwatch,not_removed,exactly this entire team from the gif should have heard the symmetra putting her turrets up outside the spawn or looked at her standing there as she put them up there were so many ways they could have avoided an instant team kill
Overwatch,not_removed,you can say that about literally any hero though just go where they cant hit you ta da countered
Overwatch,not_removed,thats not countering thats dodging or avoiding countering is having the tools to eliminate or mitigate a threat to you or your team example is winston is genjis counter because he doesnt need to aim can keep up with genji with his leap and has a lot of health to endure the fight
Overwatch,not_removed,i dont complain about characters in my games either a match is not the place to talk about balance and i hardly think people at high master would like me clogging their chat with that type of talk nobody cares were there to play that doesnt mean i dont have an opinion on them furthermore i want to add that my criticism doesnt come from a place of not being able to deal with her accurately i dont even play heroes that often have to engage a symmetra its an opinion that i formulated from watching things unfold with my teams and with my boyfriends teams he plays in diamond rather than experiencing it if you want to disagree on that front and argue that i wouldnt know unless i fight symmetras often enough then that would be a different story
Overwatch,not_removed,supports arent allowed to deal damage
Overwatch,not_removed,shes not really a support shes really more of a defense hero with some supportlike abilities when you try to slot symmetra into your team comp you dont take out your ana or your lucio you take out one of your defense heroes also support vs nonsupport are not so rigidly defined in overwatch as they are in games like dota where you have farm priority and such
Overwatch,not_removed,to be fair that gun has to latch on to something then charge its not a question of sym doing crazy damage its a question of her being allowed to do sick damage the only times i really see her mowing down a team is when the team ignore her until they suddenly realise shes killed half of their team so when you hear that stupid gun of hers as tempting as shooting rein shield is turn around and smack her face in and punish her for her aggressive playstyle
Overwatch,not_removed,sounds like youve had some rough experiences on behalf of all syms were sorry next time you see a sym just do a sit emote ill make sure to pass on the word that theyre to not use their stupid guns on you and that they should go back to uhh supporting
Overwatch,not_removed,exactly once they get tilted they start playing in obvious patterns easy to set up traps in their path junkrat is so fun if you get other people going but hes tough to play when youre against cool headed players my aim is always to try and tilt people by getting trap kills or random bomb kills or even better a simple geometry kill if that fails switch to mei d
Overwatch,not_removed,fair point
Overwatch,not_removed,i would still say winston is a good counterpick
Overwatch,not_removed,her beam can kill a pharah now if she is jumping up and down its crazy
Overwatch,not_removed,yeah lots of ways to tone the frustration factor down a bit without ruining her
Overwatch,not_removed,no that is incorrect her latch used to be metres and disconnect was now her latch is and disconnect you complain about inaccuracies and then you say one in the same comment
Overwatch,not_removed,mei is unquestionably deadlier she has more range to initiate the battle she causes you to slow and freeze which symmetra does not do she has more health and she has a very powerful selfheal as well as a way to block you off either to stop you escaping or to help her escape so unless your intention is to die as quickly as possible no you would not rather mei mei outclasses symmetra in every regarded in a situation and in fact there are very few characters who can mei while most characters can in fact either kill symmetra outright in a or at the least escape her far more easily than they can escape from mei also the majority of your statements were already covered in my post which you originally replied to she has the same movement and hitboxes as many other characters if you can kill mercy you can kill symmetra in fact mercy has much stronger selfhealing an escape tool more range and can get critical hits for higher dps so
Overwatch,not_removed,idk if i see her everytime there is a map that would mean shes a staple pick in masters cool story bro i had a lot of games in masters this season too youre not getting sym in every
Overwatch,not_removed,invest one push into killing the shield gen or better yet deny the symmetra value from the beginning of the match not after minutes and dont let her get her ult
Overwatch,not_removed,are you beeing serious all i said is aim isnt the only counter to symmetra obviously aim helps but even with shit aim you can counter her if you have the most basic of gamesense an no genji is not getting hardcountered by sym sure his e is useless buthe can wallclimbdash away from her also he has insane burst damage on closerange and a tracer can just dodge symmetra forever basically even if your aim is miserable youre gonna hit some shots and wear her down unless you are not aware of the fact that tracer has abilitys you should never die to a sym as tracer winston is a soft counter but only because he has the mobility to chase her
Overwatch,not_removed,exactly shes a walking aimbot and competes with dps in short range to the point that you require perfect accuracy in order to beat her only option is wide open spaces where you have clear los greater than meters so wherever the current team fight is im not awake enough to formulate coherent arguments against sym right now because the difference between her current broken status and being reasonable would be some very small adjustments
Overwatch,not_removed,not to me i notice many times when im shooting someone as zarya in high energy there will be a small delay were i dont see them taking any damage and suddenly theyll drop dead or vice versa
Overwatch,not_removed,i liked her before the buff when the game originally came out she was the first hero that i fell in love with even when everyone said she was terrible its even still noticeable on my hero httpimgurcomagjecu and httpimgurcomafnzfw even though ive barely played her since the end of season of competitive and was excited for what the buff would do for her but i think they brought her a bit too far especially with the increased range of her beam if they want to keep it at that range then i think they need to scale the damage back a bit to compensate because shes way too difficult to get away from how she is now even with high mobility heroes
Overwatch,not_removed,along with the incompetency to act even remotely quickly this was embarrassing that zarya could have deal with it it two or three right clicks while bubbling herself to both protect herself and build charge
Overwatch,not_removed,except that symmetra literally cant do anything about you at a certain distance while you can still shoot her with other heroes they can always shoot back at you another thing is that other heroes get value differently with widowmaker for example if you hide in rooms shes already getting value however if you can get in her face with winstongenji and force her to back up you deny her value but yes generally good gamesense can help just as much at denying value as killing does
Overwatch,not_removed,you say that sarcastically but that is actually one of the key strategies to playing as pharah and countering a good number of other heroes such as roadhog bastion torb winston widow junkrat mei etc proper positioning is one of the key skills in overwatch that most people seem to ignore
Overwatch,not_removed,the difference is sym ha be to be close range to kill the only other heros who need to be close are rein and winston both of which have more mobility and more health the rest of the heros can kill her from a distance she does not have that option
Overwatch,not_removed,i guess zen didnt get the memo
Overwatch,not_removed,yes but not this insane dmg many pros think that ana is stupidly strong as well i know all the low ranked people at this reddit dont know too much about actual competitive play but yeah
Overwatch,not_removed,you actually generally do take out your lucio for a symmetra
Overwatch,not_removed,which half the time is in the middle of a melee where theres just too much movement toward the middle of the pack to pick out the sym bouncing around
Overwatch,not_removed,i mean both the official patch notes and testing between prepatch live and ptr both disagree but you do you
Overwatch,not_removed,i mean i do but ill leave it at that gl hf in ya games
Overwatch,not_removed,so dont lose the team fight got it we lost the team fight on the first push now what you are also not answering the question i am taking damage from the beam what do you mean the counter is to invest into a push symmetra is attacking me right noe what do
Overwatch,not_removed,that sounds more like lag
Overwatch,not_removed,or my patented dps ana ™
Overwatch,not_removed,zen has to aim though reliance on player skill is a balancing tool
Overwatch,not_removed,youre not actually using that chart as evidence are you because that thing has a lot of hilariously bad comparisons on it
Overwatch,not_removed,man youre reeeeally not out to make friends are ya maybe you should stay up in your ivory tower of competitive and let us miserable newbie bastards get on with playing video games for fun
Overwatch,not_removed,would be cool to see that as a summer games event
Overwatch,not_removed,zaryas graviton would make a perfect ball youll know for sure if it hits the ground ill have to set this up with some friends and see if it works

Overwatch,not_removed,cool
Overwatch,not_removed,
Overwatch,not_removed,in people blogs views since jan httpwwwredditcomryoutubefactsbotwikiindex
Overwatch,not_removed,but why is it bookmarked
Overwatch,not_removed,i watch that video alot
Overwatch,not_removed,you really prefer to watch it than to play ow xd
Overwatch,not_removed,ecks dee
Overwatch,not_removed,you mean the game is not perfect as it is right now and propose to change something youre clearly out of your mind at least thats what ive seen in this subreddit so far ive been downvoted for supporting the idea of a minimap before hell there was even that guy a few days ago thanking blizzard for not adding a minimap and his argument was basically that he had zero map awareness in other games so this game didnt make him feel stupid
Overwatch,not_removed,a mini map would be just awesome me and my friends dont get how this feature is missing
Overwatch,not_removed,game was designed with tunnel vision too much awareness is bad and makes the skill cap low i cant wait till they reduce the fov even more to make the skill cap higher s just in case
Overwatch,not_removed,i wish the chevron told me more about which hero they are as a non healer
Overwatch,not_removed,i understand why you and others want this i just dont think its necessary the chevrons work perfectly youre not supposed to go blindly charging in youre supposed to communicate with your team so you know where everyone is without looking around i get that thats not feasible in pickup games but i believe that is the intent
Overwatch,not_removed,of course chevrons help but you can only see those in your line of sight i mean if we can see the chevrons its because were supposed to know where our team is now why not make it easier by adding a minimap instead of having to rotate periodically im not saying a minimap is necessary im saying its a good solution and you can just choose whatever you like more also the chevron system works poorly for healers since you cant see critically wounded allies if you dont look directly at them
Overwatch,not_removed,i think id still argue that its working as intended that youre not supposed to have an easy time of it however your points are valid
Overwatch,not_removed,hahahahaha yes i love this
Overwatch,not_removed,
Overwatch,not_removed,because valve patched mapglitches in less than days
Overwatch,not_removed,they have consistently patched out exploits like this reapersombra into unintended locations for example im sure blizzard will patch this one out just as well
Overwatch,not_removed,didnt blizzard ban anyone temporarily as a warning who used exploits like that in the past they may not have instantly fixed it but they did punish exploiters just report
Overwatch,not_removed,thats a good question
Overwatch,not_removed,that probably depends on where you live if you live in the us and play on eu just buy them with on the us server and you should be fine you keep your skins on all servers anyway if you live in europe and try to buy with that might be seen as fraud and there could be consequences if found out im not sure though but considering theyre pushing the region lock things due to people abusing cheaper prices elsewhere i wouldnt be surprised
Overwatch,not_removed,im from the uae so buying them with usd should be fine i guess
Overwatch,not_removed,to make sure opp picks them and lose them the game to gain free elo

Overwatch,not_removed,custom game you vs ana bots head shots only
Overwatch,not_removed,play her in qm watch high level play of her on youtube or twitch
Overwatch,not_removed,will hockey make basketball obsolete this is what youre kinda asking here and the answer is just as nonsensical
Overwatch,not_removed,if it does it would be because leauge died somehow currently has active players and i dont think overwatch will ever get that many
Overwatch,not_removed,i main mercy and i agree with you on some parts i would just like to see her ultimate range increased since the cost was increased when i attempt to resurrect a group of teammates i sometimes miss one or two that imo should have definetly been resd but werent because i was like meter away from it
Overwatch,not_removed,as a side effect it would mess up the huge rez achievement its an interesting idea though
Overwatch,not_removed,the compromise id like to see is a change that allows multiple resurrections to be stored at a time up to six without needing to change ult charge rate too much this puts more of an incentive on single revives but still allows for the mass revive plays it becomes a more interesting ultimate in general with this change as well allowing a choice in playstyle between a steady stream of singular revives or the old method of holding out for many during a critical moment
Overwatch,not_removed,great suggestion it would definitely change the way compositions attack although it has been highlighted above that the change would be a drastic one to the game who knows if the team would want to make such a big change to a well established character if they arent willing to change her up in the way youve suggested then perhaps they could give her invulnerability or heavily reduced damaged intake for a short while after rez giving her more opportunity to sustain after she ults great idea though
Overwatch,not_removed,i was pretty close tldring this one but i worked through it and ill admit this would be a really nice change to how mercy should be played encouraging her to stay in the fight to keep generating rezzes would be good for everyone
Overwatch,not_removed,wouldnt a singletarget rez be counterintuitive mercys main boon besides rez is immense singletarget healing if her team is playing right most of their deaths should come from unavoidable teamwiping ults not singleplayer picks the reason she was meta in the first place was because she hardcounters ults with rez its an interesting idea and one that i could see being added to the game as a completely new support hero but not a change id like to see on mercy
Overwatch,not_removed,maybe her ultimate could stack so if she stacked it up enough she could rez everyone by going to each body individually i just wanna get those dank plays
Overwatch,not_removed,this idea has potential but i can see it creating the pocket medics who will only rez their friends problem maybe instead of changing the ult to singletarget just reduce the aoe and make it a target aoe instead of around yourself you could still rez multiple people except its harder to pull it off eliminating the pocket medic problem
Overwatch,not_removed,its an interesting idea upvote earned
Overwatch,not_removed,interesting idea to say the least making it quickly chargeable would just be another reason to kill her early on though and even if its not you should as a general rule always pick healers off first i get what you mean but overall such a drastic change is as you said yourself highly unlikely and should be done over
Overwatch,not_removed,alternative idea during the deadtorespawn timer if mercy has full ult she can cast revive targeted on herself reviving nearby allies as well this would help rebalance the problem of her avoiding team fights i think revived heroes should also be invincible for seconds but able to move immediately a huge issue with her res at the moment is that your allies are all stuck in place so the second the opponents hear the callout they can sight up headshots or fire off another ult to kill them immediately again
Overwatch,not_removed,this really makes me want to have different builds on heroes
Overwatch,not_removed,mercy would never get potg so how would you fix that potg for huge rez is my drug as a mercy main lol
Overwatch,not_removed,most of the time a teammate dies its usually because they were out of position so when you rez them it is very like they will be still in danger and the second delay means that the enemy can get into position to deal with the situation while the heroes you rezed are sitting ducks and this is why most of the time after i revive they all end up dead shortly after therefore if you revive a single player he should be placed next you upon revival this lets you ensure their safety also why the fuck cant she fly by herself
Overwatch,not_removed,mercy is not bad she is not being played just because zen and lucio are just too good not to play their oncoming nerfs and her new buff should help mercy see more play i would be wary of more changes or well end up back in the stier mercy meta being able to constantly revive even teammate at a time would make her op considering its fairly common to use her ult as it is just to revive important teammates dunno why you think this change would make her less targeted it would actually make it worst since you would no longer be able to predict when her res will be up best to get rid of the threat asap
Overwatch,not_removed,ok so i kinda agree and disagree first off i think what your suggesting sounds real fun to try out it would drastically change the way you play mercy and could make for some really long intense fights but the problem is that this makes for a more agressive playstyle and it forces mercy to be more out in the frontlines to be really effective currently she is way to squishy for that if they added some sort of defensive ability it would negate this but if we take it that far blizzard might aswell just keep mercy where she is and make a new character i have actually been thinking about changes that should be made too this is what i would propose first off when her ultimate is up you get a little indicator in the form of a circle with a number in it at the bottom of the screen that tells you how many you will ressurect this will help to make sure you get everyone with your rez second when you do use your ult mercy and everyone you rez gets seconds of invulnerability this would safely get mercy out of harms way and would help the team group up again this for me would be the most important because i have experienced too many times that mercy would group rez and then get wiped again because she is too squishy to be out in the open alone and the rezd teamates start running around like headless chickens while they try to get the lay of the land one more thing you say you feel dissapointed whenever you get just rez in a game when you shouldve been able to get i think youre forgetting one important thing about playing mercy even though her ultimate is a multirez its not the quantity of ressurects that matters its the timing and choice of who you rez if you push a point mange to get the upper hand and then suddenly a tracer sticks a bomb to your reinhardt then you are royally screwed you have no tank no bullet sponge this is where you can save the attack its only one rez but its a really important one if you capture the point because of your single rez then that ult was way more important than getting lots of rez on your stats you might actually have singelhandedly secured a win on the other hand a full team rez is totally pointless if there is a bastion pointing his turret that way my suggestion of sec invulnerability comes to mine here or if the the enemy team is grouped up around your teammates corpses tldr fun idea imo invulnerability after rez would be better rez is about quality and timing not quantity
Overwatch,not_removed,the real downside i see to this is just someone being in a group with a pocket mercy using her ult solely for that one person ive seen it before with her normal ult which causes a lot of losses for their teams cases where weve wiped half their team but they wont pop ult and the single moment where the person in their group dies ult is instantly popped as if thatll stop the three heroes around the target from dying again it would be hilarious to see a mercy just constantly reviving one hero as their team gets angry at them but it would be annoying if said hero is roadhog imagine basically a roadhog with extra lives you finally take him down and ult it popped you somehow manage to take him back down and if it takes too long poof hes back
Overwatch,not_removed,it will no longer be an absolute necessity to take mercy out at the beginning of every team fight could you explain your reasoning for this please if shes no longer constrained to saving her rez for the right momentfor a whole team rez and can just spam away at single teammates in rapid succession shed arguably be more of a threat imo edit alternative idea remove range limit remove invulnerability remove the movement disable but keep the ability disable teammates get teleported to mercy or the ground closest to her to avoid troll ults when revived allies take reduced damage while being rezzed additionally allow guardian angel to be used on enemies give it a longer cooldown if used on an enemy with the changes above mercy would have to be more aware of her positioning when ulting but her ability to reposition would be more flexible her rez could be used for a tactical retreat fly to an ally a surprise engage fly to an enemy or a general regroup
Overwatch,not_removed,id if skull on the corpse changed color while near respawning maybe turning red while there is seconds left or so i know you can see the timer but sometimes its really hard to pay attention on it while youre busy dealing with enemy genji
Overwatch,not_removed,single res with less cooldown is op af
Overwatch,not_removed,i can definitely get on board with that
Overwatch,not_removed,thats true cant they just change the achievement though maybe getting resurrections in the span of one minute or something
Overwatch,not_removed,yes i completely agree i didnt go that far simply because there isnt a single ultimate in the game that stacks like that so i thought maybe thatd be a little too much to even ask for but i absolutely agree that that would be ideal
Overwatch,not_removed,i appreciate you making it through im a very wordy person i swear i tried my best though
Overwatch,not_removed,i really like that idea simply because it feels like something they could change much more easily it doesnt solve the entire problem like you said but its still something good idea
Overwatch,not_removed,honestly a single person rez is still a big deal often times if your team is holding really well the enemy team will wait to push until theyve picked someone on your team so they can force a this kind of ult change would drastically slow down poke compositions that try this in favor of faster more burst focused ones or poke compositions that can more easily focus mercy which honestly this makes sense for mercys purpose in the game anyway as her incredible sustain healing makes it hard to focus someone down from a distance in the first place it would really punctuate her role as a support instead of being about sweeping plays shed truly be about keeping good tempo and holding firm ground as i feel she was designed to be about in the first place if i had to guess based on her healing versus other supports i really do feel mercy shouldnt be about taking back lost team fights but instead about making it more difficult to lose those fights in the first place im not sure either if this kind of change would really work but id like to see her role be more focused
Overwatch,not_removed,you make a good point but there are already two other supports who counter ults better than she does wouldnt you say
Overwatch,not_removed,theres an idea i get that many would miss the huge potgs i just think its a worthwhile sacrifice
Overwatch,not_removed,exactly the lack of positional advantage is huge as for the selfrevive this was a thought i toyed around with but i felt that that may be a little frustrating for the enemy team in that there would be no possible way to prevent revive then you dont want any aspect of the game to be uncounterable
Overwatch,not_removed,i was actually going to mention this in the post not as many potgs but wouldnt you say thats a small price to pay in order to actually be able to fight alongside your teammates and pull of resurrections a game and multiple ones per push
Overwatch,not_removed,so symmetra doesnt get potg for her teleporter being used in a clutch moment mercy could still get potg the oldfashioned waykill for it
Overwatch,not_removed,yeah i think giving her at least some independent mobility would be very nice and i agree with what you said just put in a tracerrecall like animation upon being revived so that the person doesnt get too confused
Overwatch,not_removed,i think it would make her less targeted because theres no chance for her to revive their entire team as it used to be mercy had to be the first to go no matter what i think with the change shed still be a target like any support but you could win the team fight without killing her first because she can only resurrect one person an ultimate or any multikill would still give an advantage even after the resurrect personally i dont see how she could be more targeted than she already is but i get your point
Overwatch,not_removed,yeah in that case kill the mercy lol as for the friendpocketing i agree it would happen but that already happens it happens with anas ultimate too you cant make or not make a change based on whether a certain type of player would use the change effectively or not but i agree that could get annoying
Overwatch,not_removed,the problem with moving though is that it would incentivize dying because you get to move this would result in more kamikaze attacksjumpoffacliffs then a rez right over the payload which i do not think is what blizzard wants less strategy
Overwatch,not_removed,my reasoning is that if you just use brute force to win the team fight outright by a couple kills or you get a mulitkill than the enemy mercy will only be able to do so much to counter that it was a fair question and maybe a point i shouldve backed up more she is still important to take out like any support but if you plan on using ultimates to wipe multiple of her teammates shes not as much of a threat anymore shes more of a threat in the longer fights
Overwatch,not_removed,could you explain
Overwatch,not_removed,resurrections with out dying a rez every seconds is ludicrous considering youll need a teammate to die every seconds too
Overwatch,not_removed,symettras portal is an example it doesnt stack however her ultimate are indeed charges
Overwatch,not_removed,thats a really good point about poke compositions when my team attacks we also focus on getting that one kill and then pushing in so if mercys ult made it much harder to do that it would force them to make a bigger more dramatic push and start with an offensive ult which could then maybe be countered by a zen or lucio ult the game is all about counters and counters to those counters and so on so mercy would just be filling a different kind of role than the other supports and force a different approach to the fight
Overwatch,not_removed,well i think the reason mercys ult is stronger than lucios or zenyattas is because it completely wastes the other teams ults if shes not killed lucio and zenyatta can pop ult when their team starts getting overwhelmed but theres still a good chance the team thats initiating will come out with the advantage whereas a team rez guarantees an ult advantage since pharas pretty much completely out of the meta by now rip i think mercy needs a buff to mobility when pharah was more popular mercy used to be really mobile and that was the fun part of playing her it came with the added bonus that pharah was pretty good at avoiding ults without pharah mercys hover is kinda useless
Overwatch,not_removed,not really how is rezing one person when your whole team gets killed on a point in the last seconds going to help anything theyre just going to die immediately the healer is always going to be a first target no matter what because theyre healing their team just seems like a way for supports to get even more hate than they already do and thats definitely not needed in my opinion this would make her even less of a choice to pick but who knows could be something for a new character to have though
Overwatch,not_removed,symmetra can actually get potg by killing people with her gun and turrets how exactly is mercy going to pull off multiple kills with her pea shooter her job is to be healing people not shooting soo
Overwatch,not_removed,shell still be targeted she would only have the twice the value of a normal target as opposed to or times the value
Overwatch,not_removed,usually you push when someone gets a pick right mercy would just res then and its even again its bascially and she could get another red during the push itself
Overwatch,not_removed,i think resurrections without dying would be a piece of cake also i rarely have the problem of not enough teammates dying unfortunately
Overwatch,not_removed,ill agree with you about pharah and mobility itd be nice if the wings could be used proactively as an upward boost when used without a target so that we have fewer cases of mercy relying on teammates for her mobility but then itd need a longer cooldown possibly as for rez countering ults mercy dying in of the scenarios that would warrant a rez feels like the issue id suggest either increasing mercys health or allowing her to rez herself
Overwatch,not_removed,she wouldnt be able to do anything if your whole team dies at once the whole point is it would change how she is played and how she is played against losing one person on your team at the beginning of the fight would now be negated she would be more about sustaining the fight than totally reversing the outcome of it i just dont see how anyone finds it fun to hide in a corner and cross their fingers plus if youre good you can get multiple resurrections in the same team fight that would make a big difference does a good job of explaining why a one man rez is actually important
Overwatch,not_removed,easily actually you should be able to reliably shoot and kill people while hiding behind a tank or when someone tries to flank you her blaster does great damage also your team shouldnt need constant healing the down time should be more than enough to get some nice kills id suggest playing a few rounds focusing on using her blaster to kill and only heal people nearby when its convenient eventually youll get used to switching over to the gun quickly to take someone out
Overwatch,not_removed,yeah something like that agreed
Overwatch,not_removed,i agree with this but were talking about a heroes ultimate would you say that it is better than transcendence also it would change the way a team has to approach the fight mercy would now counter the pick one guy and push in but she wouldnt counter any sort of wellused ultimate or multikill
Overwatch,not_removed,thank you for mentioning that thats the entire point of my post its not that mercys ultimate cannot be gamechanging in the perfect scenario its just that that scenario rarely if ever presents itself since if youre in the fight you most likely died too whereas if you were zen when you got gravity surged and rocket barraged you could have at least tried to transcend
Overwatch,not_removed,her whole purpose as a character is to be able to counter a team wipe and if youre good and youre team isnt a bunch of noodle brains there is no reason for you to be hiding in a corner ive never had to do that also if youre good you get multiple resurrections throughout big fights anyways as long as youre not holding on to your rez like some do i usually wait until at least two people die then rez or if its a major fight and the tank goes down ill rez just them her ult isnt as hard to get as people make it out to be like i said this could be something for a new character maybe with the ability to actually shoot while healing i could see it work but again healers will always be taken out first regardless of what they do if the other team has any brains at all thats the flankers jobs
Overwatch,not_removed,i would totally do this and have before when the team isnt protecting me but there are always going to be people crying why is mercy shooting and not healing supports dont need more hate than they already get people already rage when you miss them in a team rez because theyre out of range i can only imagine the horror if you had to choose only one person to rez i know id be picking a different support not a fan of being yelled at and blamed by a sucky team and by sucky team i mean any qp match ever lol
Overwatch,not_removed,it is better because you said make it a short cd short cd ult means it has to be a weak ult or it is overpowered
Overwatch,not_removed,i say just let them crytheyll take care of you or they wont be healed otherwise take care of the biggest ally to hide behind and kill whenever you dont need to be healing your meat shield the mute and squelch chat buttons are friends to every support
Overwatch,not_removed,if a random guy on the internet whining really affects the way you play that much im sorry because youre gonna get that anywhere and for playing any way
Overwatch,not_removed,also i think it would be less about picking one out of the dead teammates to revive and more about just reviving the first person who dies in the fight in order to prevent being outnumbered so idk if youd get as much of the whyd you revive him not me as you might think and even if you do its your ultimate you can use it however you think is best
Overwatch,not_removed,it is a weak ultimate in that it only revives one person when i compared it to transcendence i was taking into account the short cool down obviously transcendence itself is better than a oneman revive but it takes much longer so it may even out
Overwatch,not_removed,it doesnt effect me personally at all actually but there are a lot of people that it does if i get whiny people on my team spamming for heals when they are missing and constantly letting me die i just switch off support all together and they go without a healer because theyre all pros and wont change but ive talked to many people on this subreddit that are affected by people being pissy towards healers when without one the team would more than likely lose the match just take a look at the weekly rants and youd know that
Overwatch,not_removed,no i agree that people whine like crazy for no reason i just dont think you can balance a hero based on whether stupid people playing online will whine about it or not because everyone whines all the time
Overwatch,not_removed,im real happy for you imma let you finish but voice line please
Overwatch,not_removed,not the pirate black deadstock
Overwatch,not_removed,the one shitpost to haunt my dreams nicely done
Overwatch,not_removed,no more zaryas at point a please baby no more zaryas at point a
Overwatch,not_removed,yeezy yeezy yeezy just jumped out of my mech
Overwatch,not_removed,very nice very simple shit post quick simple and to the point i like it
Overwatch,not_removed,yall throwin winstons at me yall know that reapers cant read
Overwatch,not_removed,im real happy for you imma let you finish but nerf this
Overwatch,not_removed,you niggas cant fuck with ye i pick hanzo at the last moment so you cant see who i play
Overwatch,not_removed,wow nice man
Overwatch,not_removed,your link doesnt work heres a working one
Overwatch,not_removed,ah it works on pc ill put that in for mobile users
Overwatch,not_removed,my bad neither you put worked for me now so phone might just be messed up regardless its awesome news and im glad to have the chance to prove to my friends that i play lucio because i suck at the game
Overwatch,not_removed,so what you basically say is that you should be able to abuse the system by letting one of your mates quit the game so you never rank down
Overwatch,not_removed,if they got rid of that penalty and i was in an unscrupulous group then we would just start doing round robin if we are about to lose have one team member drop they take the hit so we all dont and then next time next group member down the list does and so on they could probably track but then that opens up to just more issues your group is only so what about the other you are just starting trying a new group with new people and you dont know they like to drop etc
Overwatch,not_removed,i asked for placement matches only also if one of your group members keeps leaving your whole group should be getting a penalty that should be pretty easy to track
Overwatch,not_removed,make it so that your group gets a penalty instead of just a single player its not hard to come up with solutions for this at all if someone in your group leaves its your own fault for not making sure they had the time to play or they had the capacity to stay even while losing
Overwatch,not_removed,the system is easy if you started playing you get a lose every moba ever worked this way additionally you don t get a lose if someone leaves the first mins if you lose the first round and its halftime you played the half game if you re behind now you did that together and not the leaver alone
Overwatch,not_removed,so groups are penalized but not the random players or other group seems like people will just complain about that as well you think its easy to solve because youre just thinking about what your complaint is not what others will complain about people will be in way more of an uproar if it was done that way unevenly given out im not saying your complaint is invalid but just to understand no way is perfect and they just try and minimize complaints your solution youve offered in a couple comments at best wouldnt decrease complaints and i would bet it would actually increase them edit it is hard to come up with viable solutions for stuff like this if it was so easy it would already be fixed they do a lot of testing when they build a game over a couple years
Overwatch,not_removed,thats completely ridiculous even if youre winning and someone leaves having a basically results in a loss theres an extremely rare chance that you somehow manage to carry the team with less person youre given a disadvantage on the off chance that someone thats not even part of your group has to leave or decides to rage quit you know how stupid that is in my case during the game that prompted me to post this we went on a payload map with and after the point their sheer numbers advantage just made it impossible to win i understand the scenario when someone in your group leaves thats entirely your fault as you know the people and should have made sure that your friends had the time to play or made sure you wouldnt play with someone thats prone to rqing but other wise its entirely unnecessary really ow players seem to complain about having a useless genji or some stupid shit like that but thats the equivalent of having a whys that not ok and this is
Overwatch,not_removed,you misunderstood me in the case of say a group of having someone leave have the entire group of have a penalty instead of just the person that left in the group of there would still be a single player penalty for some random person leaving obviously
Overwatch,not_removed,give me an example of how it would increase complaints with the solutions ive offered
Overwatch,not_removed,it is just too complicated to make a system where you find a reasonable loss forgiven and a lose that is deserved i know it s often not the teams fault that this one person left but you can t demand that a game should be forgiven there are always people finding this unfair but you started as a team and if one left you lose it as a team even tho this one guys acts against your team and simply saying it should be always forgiven is also wrong because people could have a disconnect seconds before the game is over and guys get lucky
Overwatch,not_removed,i think you misunderstood what i replied thats exactly what i am addressing people would flip out thats not fair still that it is not given evenly someone in the group drops then whole group is punished and not randoms or other group they want to promote grouping and playing if they added that rule where specific groups are punished for actions of a player in the group it would deter people from meeting new players and grouping sucks when people drop but the individual penatly for dropping should be huge and then the team still has a chance to fight it out and maybe get a win i think having a very strong penalty on the player who drops and letting the rest of the team finish for better or worse is the best option
Overwatch,not_removed,i already didliterally in my last comment edit are you reading replies this is the time youve said something that doesnt make sense if you read the comment you are replying to or maybe just skimming since youre getting a few replies
Overwatch,not_removed,thats completely stupid thats like being back in grade school and someone did something bad so the whole class gets punished for it you started as a team and lose as a team is not a valid excuse at all
Overwatch,not_removed,if someone disconnects seconds before the match it wouldnt count like theres a system for disconnecting early why isnt there a system for disconnecting late theres plenty of counter measures this just seems like youre trying to be lazy about solutions
Overwatch,not_removed,if youre playing in a group in competitive you should make sure that your team mates wont leave regardless youre trying to win the game it is entirely your groups responsibility that you also give everyone else youre queued up with a fair chance to play the game as well also in my opinion having the group being punished would not be a large deterrent for group play at all i really doubt that people are currently forming parties with random people in the current set up anyways if its really such a big concern then dont play competitive in a group of randoms and only play with people you know
Overwatch,not_removed,and if the whole class did something and only guy gets punished that is fair
Overwatch,not_removed,like i said the system is too complex if you re for example losing the first round on defense and someone quits is it reasonable to give a lose forgiven or make it count i mean you lost it together but the leaver took the chance to come back to make sure blizzard can t do the mistake its easier to leave it in the hands of the community
Overwatch,not_removed,best place to find more players to play competitive is to play competitive not everyone has a lot of people to play with already or know people irl who play it would make it more difficult for them to find new groups to join and play competitive either way we just see it differently which is fine the developers will go with the best solution in the long run so well see down the road which prevails
Overwatch,not_removed,what does that even mean if your whole team leaves only one person gets punished i mean if you left first youve kind of set up the team for failure in the first place thats the entire reason i made this post theres no case where whole class did something guy gets punished mentality makes sense in this scenario and if you were part of a group your entire group would be punished as per reasons ive said before
Overwatch,not_removed,i really doubt it would change much if people are going to play in a group theyd play in a group how hard is it even with someone random that you maybe met on reddit to ask them do you have enough time to play if they rq and youre left with a loss in your hands then you simply dont play with them because they already seem to be prone to a bad habit i doubt many people would want to play with a rqer even in the current system in the off chance that its a dc blizzard already said leaving once or twice wont do anything anyways if you dc often enough for the penalty to kick in then you shouldnt be playing in the first place
Overwatch,not_removed,well what you demand is the leaver gets the lose the rest not but it could be possible that you deserved to lose the game there but you get pardoned you would never complain about that at all
Overwatch,not_removed,how often honestly are you going to get people willing to leave the game for the rest of the random people in your team to get a pardon i dont think this would happen often enough where this would actually be a problem the system it self is already a deterrent for leaving all this does is smooth out the edges in a case where youre already losing should you not have the opportunity to try and turn it back around instead of having a chance to lose
Overwatch,not_removed,well the one person in your team decides to make sure you don t get that chance it s just how it happens with every competition if guy in your team decide to ruin your team you have to live with that but you have to think that your team is the reason you won a game it can also be the reason you lose one
Overwatch,not_removed,but i dont want to live with that thats the entire point of this post its ridiculous to have person leave out of no where and then you have to say oh well i guess rngesus just didnt favor me today if i wanted that to happen id be playing hearthstone right now
Overwatch,not_removed,you just went full out of the topic with the hearthstone call hearthstone is an rng card game while meeting the people from your team is rng its still your actions that mostly make the person leave and if he has connection issues he won t play many more competitive games anyway and the leaver could also be on the enemy team so just stop complaining and focus on your own skill you can easily win games and then you can live with a lost game thx to someone afk
Overwatch,not_removed,your response for having a poor system is simply get good thats stupid the vast majority of players are never going to be able to have the time or the capacity of even getting to the point where theyre winning games the point is that im not living with a simple lost game its the fact that you have no control over the fact that you lost the game why should you be punished for this it doesnt matter if the leavers on the enemy team there should be a counter measure so that one of you doesnt get a free win because of some unlucky occurrence
Overwatch,not_removed,symmetra works for the vishkar corporation which if you read lúcios background is a pretty scummy company as such shes kinda working for the bad guys i dont think the left vs right side of the roster on the homepage is much beyond just random artwork of the heroes
Overwatch,not_removed,she was recruited shes kinda in the gray area she does want to make the world a better place but is pretty damn unfeeling about it
Overwatch,not_removed,wait what why its easy to see at the corner of your screen on a similar topic custom screens hud would be cool
Overwatch,not_removed,why not focus on learning other roles than dps healers and tanks are both incredibly fun to play and certain tanks will just carry the game for you the larger pool of heroes you are comfortable playing with the more success you will have
Overwatch,not_removed,bias mode activate junkrat is very effective at going behind enemy lines and annoying the hell out of the enemy team if you can keep a steady stream of damage andor distraction on the back you can either wipe most of the enemy or distract them long enough for your team to wipe them
Overwatch,not_removed,mei they have more or less exactly the same play style
Overwatch,not_removed,i know other roles it is the idea of learning a role to the extent that goes past normal that i am looking at example i have hours on reinhardt and or so on sombra
Overwatch,not_removed,mei and sombra have the same play style what game do u play
Overwatch,not_removed,i was about to ask that when did mei become a flanking demon of death is that a new update she is now more than the devil she is a shadow lurking in the ice oh god if they allowed her to walk through her ice wall that would be friken disturbing as hell
Overwatch,not_removed,the game where mei sombra are both cqc oriented heroes are both great at finishing off weakened targets are both great at annoying and harassing the enemy team are both great at using their abilities to navigate the map in ways the opponents do not expect are both great at using their abilities to prevent their own demise are both able to completely change the flow of the game with a single ultimate
Overwatch,not_removed,
Overwatch,not_removed,mei is slow and can be shut down very easily if apart from ones own team sombra is fast and can escape situations where she is not with her team nbsp pharah and sombra both are great at finishing weakened targets she is annoying at harassing the enemy team can navigate the map in ways opponents do not expect can use her abilities to prevent their own demise is able to completely change the flow of the game with a single ultimate
Overwatch,not_removed,in unique situations maybe but that is really a niche that can be done by many other heroes with sustain abilities she is not going to be flanking especially if you are using her in a defensive manner
Overwatch,not_removed,sombra mei actually have similar play styles sombra pharah do not considering that mei actually has more base hp than sombra and is universally considered one of the most tedious heroes to get around to killing i really must question what scale of comparison youre using to claim mei can be shut down very easily whether you play her or not it doesnt change the fact that mei is a cqc hit and run specialist when used correctly
Overwatch,not_removed,i am just noting what you said as being a comparison for what i said about pharah i know she does not play like sombra but that goes for mei as well if played properly
Overwatch,not_removed,i am okay with people dropping rank on purpose but please do it in a dont cost other players their games if they actually want to win
Overwatch,not_removed,thats what my plan is im trying to find people to do it with
Overwatch,not_removed,i like the idea of medals for least deaths but it might encourage people to not suicide into control points to prolong overtime a lot of players are already hesitant and just stand outside trying to shoot stuff
Overwatch,not_removed,only if you get gold medals for least deaths
Overwatch,not_removed,when i play mercy i know im getting the gold medal for the most deaths
Overwatch,not_removed,thats a guarantee every champ on the enemy team is going to jump you so you generally end up dying the most although one game i got a gold medal for eliminations as well

Overwatch,not_removed,why doesnt road hogs ult push bastion out of sentry mode when his hook does
Overwatch,not_removed,is road hog considered op only in low ranks i just started playing and he seems extremely strong and annoying when i empty two full stacks of mcree bullets in him and hes still chilling at and me but i watched some pro games and he is not played a lot there to make a comparisson with csgo is road hog like the good on lower ranks but bad against good players
Overwatch,not_removed,bastion is just too good in some places its crazy i just dont know how to deal with him for example last point of numbani on defense they had bastions reinhartdtoblerone ana and genji one set behind the reinhardt inside the building that is directly in front of the tunnel and one sat far away from them on the stairs to kill any flankers from the right toblerone sat his turret somewhere in the middle to cover up all sides what am i supposed to do the bastion in fornt of the tunnel is covered by reinhard in front of him genji all over the place ana to heal and boost him another bastion to kill any flank possibilities and torbjorn turret that is basically a flank detector and death machine how can we possibly breach this defense we didnt trickle at all and still got slaughtered every team fight what are good picks against this comp whats the strategy how do i beat almost completly hidden bastions
Overwatch,not_removed,anyone know how to fix that bug where the cursor gets stuck over top of the crosshair while not in a menu restarting works but is there an easier way
Overwatch,not_removed,how do i play as the mercy half of a pharmercy every time i try i seem to get left behind by pharah is it simply a case of using guardian angel exclusively on pharah and holding spacebar constantly to have her slowfall ability on i feel like it shouldnt be that hard but i constantly mess it up
Overwatch,not_removed,stupid question probably out of the loop idk but have artists on the sub got something against imgur i thought everyone was aware that workplaces tend to block deviant art and tumblr i can understand them linking us to their deviantart profile but it would be nice if they provided us with an imgur mirror
Overwatch,not_removed,so forgive me if this is answered somewhere else i really have tried to google it several times what exactly does that mean meta as in they dont set up the initial defense according to the pro meta is just an example or people will say this hero is meta thank you in advance
Overwatch,not_removed,i have a question for roadhog players why is it that when i get hooked as a zarya and im spamming shift sometimes i get my barrier up to absorb the damage and other times it comes out a second too late is it a connection thing or do you time your shots properly also when you hook someone do you prefer to left click or right click

Overwatch,not_removed,is there any sort of amnesty planned for early leavers penalty as a result of ddos and server instability i logged into one today after an uphill battle trying to practice last night and itd be reasonable to assume thered be measures in place by now to avoid punishing players who disconnect due to quantifiable server instability rather than hitting leave game

Overwatch,not_removed,ive been wondering this for a while now because i think it might be affecting me does the skill rank preformancejudging algorithm bias towards players who only play one role the whole game i think this because this is how it was explained to me you play pharah and get damage the average pharah damage for that map for your skill level is you get bonus skill rank but sometimes i will be on my way to damage but halfway through the map my friend wants to switch onto pharah so i switch onto mercy lets say the average healing for mercy on this map is i only get half a map to play mercy so i only heal i only get half a map to play pharah so i only deal damage both of these numbers are below average for their respective heros and roles do i get less skill rank edit formatting

Overwatch,not_removed,hanzos arrow speed buff will effect ultimate speed too
Overwatch,not_removed,i was stuck in last season and i dont want to suck so much this time how do i git gud on ranked
Overwatch,not_removed,im thinking of picking the game up now that ive got the money i played the beta and had a pretty good time has it received any changes that point towards the game being ruined or losing its appeal over time
Overwatch,not_removed,the simple answer is that the stun from his hook interrupts bastions turret form and then pulls him while his ult simply does a knock back effect which iirc is registered differently by the game if youre asking why balance wise i got nothing for ya
Overwatch,not_removed,im more upset that winstons ult doesnt knock back a bastion in sentry mode its a rude awakening to go primal and be wiped by a deeply engrained bastion
Overwatch,not_removed,as was noted above the hook has a unique position in the games code as one of the very few things that pushes bastion out of sentry mode i also think this is in roadhogs best interests the way whole hog works is that it deals incredibly high damage when targets are at close range therefore when a target cant be pushed back and roadhog can get close with whole hog it can deal a huge amount of damage
Overwatch,not_removed,magnets
Overwatch,not_removed,for a tank compared to the other tanks he lacks utility all other tanks have some sort of protecting mechanism in their kits while roadhog doenst i guess that the biggest reason why he isnt palyed a lot in competitive additionally winstons mobility reinhardts and zaryas ult make them better characters in a team based competitive enviroment roadhogs has two things that make him unique first is his insane dmg while being a tank but dmg wise roadhog is more or less a more hp reaper while not be able to flank effectively what makes him good when you dont know how to play around him is his hook if you get hooked you are most likely dead with the exception of tanks or maybe bastion so for people in lower ranks that dont know how to doge he is pretty deadly
Overwatch,not_removed,roadhog is a good all round tank with some major weaknesses reaper being a primary one i would say he is well balanced with some needed changes coming to the hook to prevent some of the annoying pull around walls issue
Overwatch,not_removed,static defense like that cant shoot unless they see you explosives are your friend they wear down shields quick and dont require line of sight to hurt communicate and spam explosives junkrat and pharah are your friends here a rein is good too but dont expect his shield to last long
Overwatch,not_removed,it all depends on the teamwork at this point tbh if you can coordinate a flanker like genji or tracer to engage as your front line engages generally the genjitracerflanker can pick off the supportbastiontorb quite easily in my experience ive found the easiest way to break it if youre solo is flanking the left side as roadhog and getting a pick on someone also try to engage straight after your team has destroyed the torbjorn turret and if torbjorn ults before you engage just back off and wait it out
Overwatch,not_removed,perhaps a tracer and reaperjunkrat for the bastions roadhog for gengi widowhanzo for ana and torb lúcio for speedboosting past the choke and aoe heals hes hard target to hit and zen for discord and extra heals
Overwatch,not_removed,team work team work team work we all for the most part know this try the dva jump ult let your teammates know youre gonna ult most likely they will try to distract bastion for a sec go in slow hide for a sec a than jump right on his shit
Overwatch,not_removed,honestly if im in a game and they whip out multiple bastions i leave thats cheap bullshit
Overwatch,not_removed,thats odd try altenter to switch to and from windowed mode
Overwatch,not_removed,seconding that question thought i was the only one who lost his mind over that
Overwatch,not_removed,yeah thats sort of the basics of it heavy use of ga and angelic descent and never letting pharah out of your sight you dont necessarily need to stay in the air all the time though that depends a lot on the map and your pharah in the middle section of hollywood for example youre often safer on the rooftops than in the air
Overwatch,not_removed,ive always thought that a cool buff for her would be that she has an infinite flight when healing a teammate and you could use the jump and crouch buttons to ascend and descend just imagine pairs of mercy flying in the air the mercy fights just went airborn
Overwatch,not_removed,answer is it depends i usually try to keep myself in the air if they have characters who have trouble taking down airborne units junkrat reind tracer etc primary concern should still be to keep safe as you are a higher priority target than pharrah if you are doing this and still getting left behind the pharrah is probably playing overly aggressively
Overwatch,not_removed,that is pretty much it yes if you have a friend to play with maybe ask if you could practice it together
Overwatch,not_removed,imgur links are also blocked on a lot of workplaces mine of example so in the end its just a choice of the artist and i can understand linking a deviantart page without giving a mirror because that way you get people to visit your profile instead of looking at the imgur link and be gone after that
Overwatch,not_removed,most artists are on tumblr so thats seldom a consideration im fairly certain most art posts here just link to someone elses art as the reddit and tumblr overwatch community are very different
Overwatch,not_removed,adding on to what others have said reposting other peoples artwork to imgur without permission is considered a little rude by some artists
Overwatch,not_removed,speaking as someone who posts art here i am just not very familiar with imgur as an art platform id rather direct traffic to my blog where i post stuff regularly than what seems to me to be mainly just a mirror site that id only use when posting a fanart for reddit once in a blue moon its great for posting quick sketches that i dont want on my main blog but otherwise id rather direct traffic to the places where i am actually active i have also tried posting images with an imgur mirror attached and it seems to me that many people who might have thrown in a like or a reblog since they were already on tumblr might now click on the imgur link instead i have yet to have anyone ask me personally for an imgur mirror so tumblr being blocked in workplaces isnt something i normally think about all the time either instead i see more utility in imgur mirrors when op feels like using a really obscure image hosting website that runs at snails pace and cant handle a small reddit hug
Overwatch,not_removed,meta is the accepted best way to play the game in order to win determined mostly by pros and used in mid to high tiers of competitive the meta heroes are the strongest and most beneficial and a meta tactic is the one thats proven to work best current meta is the combination of all those factors in a specific patch with its balance changes
Overwatch,not_removed,meta is all about how specific things work in the grand scheme of things heroes in the meta are deemed strong enough that they become heavily picked while other heroes that arent in the meta see significantly less play because they are seem as weaker in many situation for example one previous meta was a lot of mercy lucio tanks and dps usually being something like soldier genji reinhardt and zarya as an example you would all clump up and if you die at at once so mercy can rez now when zenyatta and mccree got changed as well as ana getting added it went from that to mercy almost never seeing play in favor of lucio and zenyatta pharah got picked less because mccree and ana are able to just snipe them so much easier and dva is seen a hell of a lot more because all the buffs have changed how they can interact with the rest of the cast
Overwatch,not_removed,its all about the timing as roadhog as far as i know no character is able ro react before roadhog can get his first shot off genji cant block reaper cant shadowwalk and zarya cant get up her barrier if roadhogs mistime their shot even a little there is a window where players can react personally i always left click after a hook followed by a melee attack
Overwatch,not_removed,afaik its not a latency issue some roadhogs are just slow with the shotgung blast after the hook as roadhog when you hook somebody you can just hold down left mouse button and it will shoot immediately this leaves no time for any hero to activate an ability tracer recall genji deflect zarya shield an so on but if they are a bit too slow you get to use your ability
Overwatch,not_removed,after you are hooked you are stunned for a very short time if the rodhog is fast enough he will be able to shoot you before you put the barrier up also you use left click left click is for short range right for medium think about it that way left click shoots just where your gun is right click fires a ball that shoots after a short distance so if you right click a enemy just at the right distance its exactly like you left click them in the face and can kill most characters in one shot
Overwatch,not_removed,run away unless theyre low although you dont have to be quite as scared of winston
Overwatch,not_removed,for zarya youre pretty much shit out of luck winston is a free kill as dva he does next to no damage to her
Overwatch,not_removed,distance
Overwatch,not_removed,probably yes unless he actually makes his way into the pro meta with his current ptr buffs he should be a lot more viable in season but the truckloads of bad hanzo mains in season gave him a bad enough reputation that youll likely get flamed for picking him even if youre actually good it should be a bit better if pro players actually start using him but people who dont follow the pro scene will likely still call you out on your pick
Overwatch,not_removed,yes you will get destroyed in chat if your team loses you will be the first blamed and if they win you will likely be called out as being carried even given his ptr buffs it will take several weeks for the perception to change if he really is viable id stay away for right now
Overwatch,not_removed,hanzo is hard to be correctly used but if youre good at him dont worry about your teammates too much just prove them youre able to be useful as hanzo especially now that hes being buffed less hate but please if you dont work out well with the team composition switch and please no hanzo in attack
Overwatch,not_removed,it depends on the situation to pick him playing on attack with a widow and ana for example and you pick a hanzo you will most likely get hate there already is a hanuo and you pick another one you will most likely get hate picking him as one of the dmg dealers in your team when he makes sense eg not necessary in the last minutes if you have to attack a point and when your team also have at least one healer and a tank it should be fine

Overwatch,not_removed,here you can find all heroes quotes included ult voices lines for enemies and allies just search here the hero youre intrested at and go on hero namequotes httpoverwatchgamepediacomoverwatchwiki
Overwatch,not_removed,
Overwatch,not_removed,not very many with that attitude
Overwatch,not_removed,ask sombra only she will know the answer
Overwatch,not_removed,just do it bro
Overwatch,not_removed,no lo sé
Overwatch,not_removed,yep on hollywood you can hear the occupant of the limo berating the accompanying heroes for taking too long
Overwatch,not_removed,a few things ill add its really hard to kill someone ana is constantly healing so if theyre in the thick of battle just focusheal that person reinhardts reapers winstons probably mccree and pharah the people who are going to be shot a lot with the biotic grenade its hell on a lucio because he cant heal himself its also hell when zenyatta uses his ult denying that is huge finally its good to use if a tracergenji jumps you throw it at your feet when theyre close one thing anas do that piss me off is ult me when theres no one nearby to kill use it when you need to push or at least when theres visible targets up ahead also your ulted target can die so heal them as theyre running around on crack dont ult a target whos low on health finally hit tab the little check marks under the people on your team are those who have ults ready to go jus tsay hey imma ult you get ready to use your visor sleep darting supports is a good way to take them out for seconds same with anyone in the back like a hanzo these targets are less likely to get shot and woke up unlike a tank whos in the front and taking fire a combo for you shoot an enemy then sleep dart them then get itno a good position and shoot then grenade that should kill any hero oh and you can use your sleep dart while youre scoped in yes itll take you out of the scope to use it but youll hit what youre aiming at
Overwatch,not_removed,her hitbox is huge so you dont have to spend a lot of time on one shot make sure youre always behind youre team and main focus is healing the grenade is the only way for her to self heal but its also good if theyre is too many people who need healing making sure youre safe is the most important thing so always try to do that first if you shoot someone whos asleep youll wake them up healing is more important than killing always go for healing first and then worry about killing people save youre ultimate and work out with your team who should get it tanks are probably the best choice but if you know if someone like genji or soldier has an ult ready give it to them
Overwatch,not_removed,ive been enjoying the hell out of ana the last several weeks shes definitely my preferred support in any attacking map im an above average player hit rank in season i am no pro but i do alright your first focus playing ana should be to heal not to do damage i find that my accuracy in unscoped is around at the end of most games in scoped its around if youre dipping below in either of these youre likely trying to fight the other team too much if you position correctly and hit most of your shots on teammates your healing can be very high im usually very pleased with anything over of team damage taken obviously this can swing wildly depending on the state of each game ana is i think a particularly effective counter to zenyatta and soldier with her antihealing grenade shes great against heroes who channel their ults mccree reaper roadhog with her sleep dart i find the most frustrating thing about playing her is when your team gets in the way of your sniping either low health teammates or vulnerable enemies close second is your team waking up sleeping tanks its so satisfying getting those on squishy heroes though
Overwatch,not_removed,hmmm no ones giving numbers so ill just throw in my cents fyi im on so pc might be very different im usually disappointed if i get of team damage taken as ana a good one could probably get above most games i think i average around to high if solo healing if your accuracy is below you probably arent quite as helpful as a good mercy or zen below and you should really think twice about picking ana in competitive my scoped accuracy is usually much higher i barely use scope at all honestly this should be as close to as possible anything below id say is bad i think my scoped is usually between although accuracy isnt the best or most accurate measure of effectiveness i think those are good targets for an average ana always prioritize lowest health teammates always try to keep your team topped off when theres not much going on or after big fights i dont use anas scope most of the time hitboxes are so big for her that hipfiring is really quick and easy its worth noting though that hip fire is a fast moving projectile while scoped shots are hitscan that is instant hits while scoped versus slight travel time on projectiles as with every other character keep moving constantly even if its just idle strafing some anas think because she can snipe they can remain stationary but this is never a good strategy for any character healing grenade is great for when enemies are right on top of you healing you and your team while damaging enemies generally anytime you can hit more than one target is a good time to use it for example a graviton surge whether friendly or not is always a good use because of so many people so close together sleep dart should be used all the time to remove enemy players from team fights meaning you have less healing to do overall but save it if you suspect an enemy ult coming soon like a reaper about to drop down into the middle of your team its likely he has a die die die ready always be within line of sight of your tanks they are damage magnets and thus quick and easy ult charge plus they are just incredibly easy to hit as opposed to those tiny genjis so youll get more healing just through improved accuracy nano boost is great for most tanks and for a few select ults most of those are obvious but a lot of people underestimate what a plain old dps can do when boosted im fond of boosting tracers good ones they can really do some damage and i can always expect to have another ult charged pretty soon anyway plus it scares the crap out of the enemy team hope this helpsdoesnt actively hinder you good luck with ana
Overwatch,not_removed,yes you can go to the options controls and click on the all heroes drop down menu to switch to each heros custom options if you change anything here its only set for that specific hero i find most benefit would be with widowmaker to switch it to circle but this is personal preference you need to find the reticle that works for you
Overwatch,not_removed,circle with bloom set to on is absolutely wonderful on soldier it gives so much information on your spread that im shocked every time i see someone not using it
Overwatch,not_removed,hanzos default reticle has the distance markers so id keep those if you know how to use them i dont zaryas default gives a visual representation of her charge bigger circle but you keep the numbers just below the reticle no matter what you pick lucios healingspeedboosting indicator and tracers blink ticks are also permanent fixtures so nothing to worry about there i use a green dot for just about everyone even heroes like soldier where i lose the spread indication i just remember that it spreads and itll spread around the dot anyway so i dont feel like im losing much in fact i got much better with him after switching from the crosshair
Overwatch,not_removed,no it is not faster but you are at least doing something before you can shoot again no hanzos ult does not kill torbs turrets i am not sure about other things like junkrats mine or trap though i dont think it affects anything placed ai matches do give exp but they either have a separate win rate or no win rate mainly just try out all the heroes and be willing to switch to what your team needs lucio is always beneficial to a team most of the tanks as well zara is a bit more difficult and junkrat is pretty good for just spamming grenades in an area without needing precise aim other than that just have fun
Overwatch,not_removed,play as your first hero if you dont know what to pick hes got good damage a sprint to get in and out a rocket for surprise burst damage a self heal so you dont need to rely on healers and med packs and his ult is literally an aimbot
Overwatch,not_removed,hello you from masteroverwatchcom is good sombra is speculated to be the next hero and is currently being teased in an arg theres a front page video that summarises the arg we basically know shes a mexican hacker who has a skull motif and an association with reaper we technically dont know shes a hero p
Overwatch,not_removed,who is sombra
Overwatch,not_removed,honestly the thing that gave me the biggest boost in skill outside of iust practice was to watch some pro streamers for the longest time i was strongly against the idea of twitch and streaming it seemed bizarre to me that anyone would choose to watch someone else play a video game but after seeing a couple links to short youtube videos of some of the top streamers curiosity got the best of me id recommend someone like seagull hes probably the biggest one anyway because he talks about what decisions hes making and why there are so many little tactical things to consider in a game like this it really made me better to listen to a top level player talk through his decisions in real time and seeing what works best in high level gameplay so id say if you really want to improve head to youtube or twitch look for a top streamer that isnt just a goofy meme factory it will really help your awareness and strategic thinking
Overwatch,not_removed,lower your sensitivity understand why you died in a spot figure out if you should have been in another safer position with more cover or teammates around
Overwatch,not_removed,start by playing vs the ai even just the training room can be good to learn the abilities of each hero since youre on and you state youre good with nobody ill sugest to avoid hero that needs much aim so no hanzo no widowmaker no mccree no ana no genji and since you are starting out ill suggest to go support being a good support is not hard if you stick to it and you dont need to aim except for ana its also fun and really satisfactory im a main support so believe me also i like playing dps sometimes when a team doesnt protect the healer and let him dies everytime thats no point on being an healer at all and is really good at it as for the defence junkrat is just spammy go for it and launch granades everywhere you will get used to it
Overwatch,not_removed,which heroes have you tried i find it impossible to aim in ow on despite having fine aim in codbattlefield mccree was the first hero i tried and i couldnt get more than a few kills to save my life switched to reaper and literally the second game i had eliminations try other roles than dps if aim is hard for you like for me rein and mercy are very forgiving
Overwatch,not_removed,one of the devs dont remember who said theyre looking at ways to improve her no mention of when theyll have something though
Overwatch,not_removed,personally id prefer if they just fixed her grapple its become rage inducing how many spots i find out for the first time wont work or latch onto some other spot and then have to wait seconds before i can go to some other spot okay i lied id really like her grapple cooldown to be reduced from to seconds
Overwatch,not_removed,i hope so but i think its unlikely
Overwatch,not_removed,rules implemented by the game or rules thought up by the community aka the meta currently competitive only differs to quick play in that you can only choose of each hero control maps are best of and payloadassaulthybrid maps have different arrangements you always play both sides once the meta is more like youre more likely to win if you have dps so its generally a good idea to follow that or with specific heroes like lucio works well on most maps mercy is more situational and is better for defense roles etc
Overwatch,not_removed,httpoverwatchgamepediacomcompetitiveplay is the summary of competitive rules note that this doesnt have updated skill rating version there is on ptr now and will most likely go live
Overwatch,not_removed,no the contents of a loot box are decided as soon as you earn it so you wont get items that are released after you leveled upbought boxes
Overwatch,not_removed,answered below tesla does more damage with fps compared to melees damage second cooldown its generally better to use tesla httpoverwatchgamepediacomwinston
Overwatch,not_removed,replying so i can see the answer too
Overwatch,not_removed,reinhardts mobility is pretty limited when his shield is up it can be pretty hard to doge something that way without letting the shield go and open your team up to be killed since reinhardt has a pretty good health pool he can take one or two shots or even more if he has a good healer behind his shield i would also bet that a lot of people that only played a few hours dont even know that symmetras secondary can pass through the shield
Overwatch,not_removed,shhh dont tell them
Overwatch,not_removed,maybe they dont want to reposition their shield and expose the team behind even if its just a few sidesteps if thats not a concern though theres hardly an excuse not to
Overwatch,not_removed,i actually have a real sense of fun when i play reaper i play a lot of support so sneaking around with big ass shotguns in both hands blowing up tanks like its going out of buissness has a real cathartic feeling to it
Overwatch,not_removed,are you sneaking up on people the joy of reaper is getting behind the team and surprise shotgunning them to the face with an occasional ult team kill
Overwatch,not_removed,i dont like playing him but i wouldnt call his gameplay thoughless
Overwatch,not_removed,im no expert never bought one myself but so it should only be a few weeks away from being announced
Overwatch,not_removed,there can only be stickies iirc so it may have been dropped in favor of the esports sticky
Overwatch,not_removed,public testing realm its a server exclusive to pc where you can test the next patch
Overwatch,not_removed,no mechanically its not an actual projectile
Overwatch,not_removed,i havent seen it tested but i doubt it as far as i know anas ult isnt actually a projectile its just animated to look like one for thematic purposes
Overwatch,not_removed,no leaver penalty is applied if you leave before the match starts thankfully this has allowed me to avoid some really bad lets all stack dva cuz its funny groups without concern
Overwatch,not_removed,last i checked yes
Overwatch,not_removed,your mmr is probably lower on console than on pc
Overwatch,not_removed,exclusive skins for heroes specifically tracer pharah soldier reaper and bastion and some bonus content for other blizzard games httpsplayoverwatchcomenusbuy flank specifically use it in a way that the enemy doesnt expect it or see it coming when youre using it youre glowing bright red everybody will either target you or run for cover so dont just run in there and pop it specially if your team isnt nearby instead try to sneak around preferably to a place where you can get a nice view to catch them offguard so they dont have time to react and rundefend themselves it specially helps if you can use it when you encounter a big fight where theyre busy fighting your teammates but expect them to pop their lucio ult to survive or a offensive ult to kill you just dont worry if you screw up a bit as long as you can get one of them or at least deal some decent damage you will be tipping the game in your teams favor
Overwatch,not_removed,some skins and extras for other blizzard games imo not worth it dont try for a team wipe its hard not to be greedy with it try to get some elevation and trigger it in the middle of a team fight works well if you come up behind the enemy team i usually wait until the skull on the healer goes red and then pull if i catch anyone elses its bonus
Overwatch,not_removed,just skins and a warm fuzzy feeling that you supported blizzard positioning dont ult if you are already the only target on their radar they will focus down on you immidiatly try to do it when they are all focused away from you and dont get too greedy unless you are setting up a wombocombo you should really only be going for a couple of kills three or more is your lucky day
Overwatch,not_removed,just go to pc not just because of the player base because you are going to have a way way better experience and a cheaper one as well
Overwatch,not_removed,pc is where its at more players more matches patches come first to the platform yada yada
Overwatch,not_removed,as a console player for years and a overwatch player for the first months of release i have to say go pc you can build a good gaming pc for and if you want to make a monster pc for like i did monitor keyboard and everything included it will play overwatch on ultra at fps and last you years before needing an upgrade the reason is simple you will never get the same control as a mouse on a controller not even close when i made the switch i noticed an immediate improvement in my game play of course the cost to enter the pc gaming world is a big hurdle to overcome ive been a console player since the sega dreamcast mainly because of the cost issue but now that i was able to make the switch i would never go back it truly is a whole different ball game i recommend going to a friends house if you can who has a pc and a few games that you like to play and trying it for yourself i know this wasnt the answer to the question you were asking xbox or but i felt that i had to mention it being that i own both of those systems and have played console and pc version of overwatch
Overwatch,not_removed,lower your mouse sensitivity lurk behind the rein shield behind pillars behind corners up high anywhere that gives you distance and cover discord first then shoot the discord gives you a target to aim for your harmony and discord orbs should be on players at all times while being mindful of the fact that not all teammates want a glowing gold orb above their heads think before you use harmony on widow and hanzo especially if their position hasnt been spotted yet dont forget to duck in and out of cover while attacking if your cover isnt a rein shield your ult counters a whole bunch of other annoying ults suck it genji use it and bask in that sweet sweet tranquility apply discord to roadhog and go for ranged headshots watch him melt into a sizzly puddle of bacon grease while you giggle to yourself you evil omnic
Overwatch,not_removed,click individually for each shot unless the guy youre fighting is real close or youre spamming at a groupchoke
Overwatch,not_removed,pull back let your teammates be your bodyguard this seems to work really well when you have a rein on your team remember zenyatta is still made of paper imho the shield increase seems to help but not enough for a lot of characters he is speedy for a reason also button mash your e and shift it will show for the most part that you are trying it wont work all the time but more often than not they will try to protect you at least i think hope this helps
Overwatch,not_removed,always discord the hero youre currently shooting be hyper aware of surroundings and dont overextend zen doesnt have a ton of health and doesnt have a lot of movement options
Overwatch,not_removed,if aiming is a problem how are you good with ana just curious
Overwatch,not_removed,probably reference to generic mecha anime
Overwatch,not_removed,to be honest i thought it was a reference to unit from neon genesis evangelion
Overwatch,not_removed,yes with the exception being junkrat ult every ults damage gets boosted general distractionccult sponging see someone nanny boosted push them as far back as possible if they kill you they wasted a lot of time wilting down your hp and getting back to the fight if they are almost any hero wont work on ever ult but can be really helpful for some point close to being capped and you respawned leap ult leap spam your way to victory when the ult starts and ends your leap refreshes instsntly in a good position you dont want to die in ult instsntly regen your hp depending on the comp you can use it as a free fuck healer card hp takes a long time to take down without things like reaper and roadhog so you can jist leap in beat down their healer in a corner and hope for the best just some ideas
Overwatch,not_removed,yes for most of them i dont think it works for junkrats riptire or dvas meka because those are considered separate entities its a very versatile ult but doesnt excel at anything it has situational benefits like the heal value and of course it can be a teamwiper if you catch everyone in a tight space or next to a ledge but i believe the most consistent value is area denial especially on escorthybrid maps saving it until the end standing on top of the payload and knocking people away as they approach it threatens locking down a game on attack or defense it actually has to be contestedcountered but often wont be because its not seen as much of a threat much less useful on assault because of the larger objective area size you generally cant get everyone off all at once to trigger the countdown this utility has been somewhat coincidentally buffed with the recent changes to overtime its harder than ever to keep resetting that clock
Overwatch,not_removed,ive found winstons ultimate most useful in two situations one when you have a lot of enemies standing on a point near a ledge and two when the enemy is surrounding the payloadcapture point and your team cant make headway its a great distraction when your team needs it to make a dent in a group of enemies
Overwatch,not_removed,affect all but junkrat ult torbj and symm turrents knock everyone around to split them up or to their death knocking away an ulting zenyatta in a teamfight is very good
Overwatch,not_removed,to add onto what the others are saying about mercys ult dvas ult does not get boosted dmg wise
Overwatch,not_removed,try playing hardwired ethernet cable no matter how good your wifi may be you will always have hiccups in connectivity hardwired connections basically eliminates that problem
Overwatch,not_removed,in the current meta littleumbrella is right lucio zen all the way on any map on any point
Overwatch,not_removed,i think its more because lúcio and zen are such a powerful offensive combo right now and fuck a mercy up to boot if im going to play her though its defending on ad because of her ability to res people around the point and the fact her mobility tends to be better with ad formations—although you still have the classic issue of the fact that such a strong zenyatta means that transcendence is usually better since it prevents the deaths and lets you sit on the point rather than skulking off to get a res lúcio is extremely strong at defending the payload due to his survivability mobility ability to bop people away the ability to counterult a push through the choke and the aoe heals from damage being spammed from the payload reaching into the flanks on those maps right now imo mercy is too easily ganked for the utility she provides considering zenyatta stops the deaths in the first place and mercy is helpless vs genji right now the dominant tank meta right now also synergise very well both ways with lúcio and zen remember you can switch around payload maps can be very snowbally but if im useless as mercy on ad i just switch to lúcio my mercy win rate is good atm from largely using her to defend points im a poor zen anyway keep in mind the healing output of all the healers too and whats situationally applicable mercy works very efficiently with beefier comps and poorly with heroes that tend to flank on offense since shes unlikely to heal them some teams want that aoe heal though to keep them topped up offense teams especially tend to get a lot of random attacks in their direction as they advance and if youre low on shields in your team youre going to be working overtime defending youre likely to take a lot of damage fast and mercys rapid single target healing helps there if they have a lot of spammers then play lúcio
Overwatch,not_removed,i turn mine on every now and then everytime it forces me to turn it back off either no one is talking or someone has an open mic with lots of noise best bet is to join the overwatch groups in the communities and join a party there seeking members usually have that a mic is required could lead to finding a good competitive group too
Overwatch,not_removed,use your jump pack jump into the enemy team immediately put your shield hold until your jump pack is recharged then jump back to the safety of your team when your health is low tanks are great at disrupting especially winston
Overwatch,not_removed,winstons biggest benefit is that he is a dive tank he can jump into a fight and disrupt the enemy team his bubble can block ults just like rein does hes very team dependent and how effective he can be depends on the team around him ideally you want to get onto the point be a nuisance and then get away he can quickly engage and disengage and his healthlack of aiming makes him good for fighting most fights if you can take them
Overwatch,not_removed,heres a very good though equally long guide to winston
Overwatch,not_removed,even souls and spirits are affected by gravity in overwatch thats why pharahs soul falls to the ground after using her ult
Overwatch,not_removed,because he shouldnt be allowed to fly its not a mobility ability its an invincibility ability
Overwatch,not_removed,the caveat to this seems to be zaryas gravity well he seems to be able to zip right out of that so its a bunch of lies and bs wrapped in a goofy mask and throat cancer
Overwatch,not_removed,two days ago jeff kaplan said theyd come soon™
Overwatch,not_removed,september is when the new competitive season begins so likely the balance and cosmetic changes will roll out then as well
Overwatch,not_removed,we might have a patch this week because i highly doubt theyll roll the new changes with the beginning of the season they might be working on it right now maybe friday so people get time to get used to it
Overwatch,not_removed,my advice is to try out the characters in a practice vs ai game to see if you enjoy playing that character for tanks you cant go wrong with learning reinhardt tho i play rein and zarya mostly because i suck as roadhog and i occasionally play dva she can be real fun to play
Overwatch,not_removed,play zarya and is a great allaround character and zarya is the tanksupport that focus on protecting allies with personal barriers and setting up wombo for your team ult
Overwatch,not_removed,for the tanks ill outline whats good about all of them dva is a highly mobile killing machine that boosts in deals damage and retreats shes got disruption but she also has got damage mobility and her allimportant defence matrix for her team reinhardt has got a shield and functions well as the backbone for the team a good push with a rein shield is often very successful and a push against a rein shield is often weak he is a protect first though his ult is very good at killing and his charge can disrupt the enemy if needed roadhog is a dps that can self heal that can pick enemies and can knockback if you dont play a lot of dps hes arguably the worst to play actually winston is a dive tank hes hard to learn because he seems weak without coordination but he can take most pretty easily enter and escape fights when he likes and his shield is second only to reinhardts shield hes good for koth zarya is the one that requires the most gamesense you need to know when your barrier is going to be effective you need to be on the front lines dealing damage you need to be aware of where you can help where you can protect your team and when to shred them like napoleon in russian winter i recommend reinhardt to most new players hes probably the most easy to pick up hes a backbone like a support for dps youre going to need to aim sometime ill go the opposite way i dont recommend genji or tracer because theyre flankers and require a lot of technical skill learn others first i dont recommend mccree because he requires good aim practice with him before you get into him pharah requires a type of aim that can be familiar high damage high mobility id say shes worth trying at least maybe not maining but worth trying reaper is more about positioning yourself than your skill a lot of his kills come from dropping down and ulting getting behind the enemy team and from dealing damage hes okay to play and a lot less of a dedicated flanker than youd expect however is the best allrounder good at close range good at medium range can heal can get back to the fight easily and has got the ability to burst down his automatic weapon does help with aiming to an extent id strongly recommend picking him up junkrat should also be considered if you can aim with him youre doing okay focus on denial and you have a dps character youre playing overall play all the characters and decide who you like if you never try tracer youll never be able to aim with her improve yourself and get used to it but if you want some easy mains reinhardt soldier and junkratpharah are some good picks that are never unappreciated on a team
Overwatch,not_removed,this list httpoverwatchwikiacomwikiachievements shows the achievements for each hero and their respective award
Overwatch,not_removed,same with overwatch players on the cart pushes it at max speed you can see on the ui therell be no more than forward arrows where it shows the cart is moving
Overwatch,not_removed,good question i didnt know this
Overwatch,not_removed,well you die the fact that you got into that position can be helped though unless youre zarya or roadhog your role is to soak up damage as a tank you should stick with your team especially healers giving them ult charge as well as protecting them getting on means you were either out of position or your team wasnt withhelping you hope this helps
Overwatch,not_removed,exactly as landon says youre not an offense hero and youre the stereotype of a tank you dont need to make kills it can be great but you need to think about protecting your entire team then you kill if you die your team wont have a shield and theyre probably going to die your role as reinhardt is crucial so please stick to it
Overwatch,not_removed,we have only tidbits of information nothing concrete we know reapers body tissue decomposes and regenerates in alarming rates causing extreme discomfort and pain id say reapers body is horribly disfigured wouldnt surprise if it was a mix of deadpool and red skull
Overwatch,not_removed,its probably deormed like deadpools
Overwatch,not_removed,zaryas barriers have a total of health and a duration of seconds if you take more than damage in less than seconds while youre protected your barrier will fade and any extra damage will dissipate should you take less than eg dmg your barrier will fade after two seconds thats why you had the impression your barriers didnt last long on you as for her energy absorption it will only add to your energy percentage as long as your shields up and no further than that for every damage points you absorb you gain and your percentage is equivalent to the extra damage youll inflict eg means youll inflict more damage zaryas deals dmg per second this means her damage will go up to dps at im always mindful of my teammates position if a teammate is directly engaging the enemy put up a barrier in him especially during an ultimate that leaves him vulnerable eg reapers death blossom or pharahs barrage as for yourself you can use your barriers to stop enemy fire some more aware players will refrain from shooting you while your barriers up that window of time allows your teammates to gain the upper hand during firefights mind you its only two seconds so make good use of that time edited to add extra stuff
Overwatch,not_removed,your shields have hp so it might seem that enemy zaryas are invincible because you didnt break their shields while the enemy focuses yours down if your shield is fully broken you should get energy and you get energy as long as the shield is up the amount only increases by damage taken its best to use reactively instead of preemptively its hard for an enemy to react to your shield getting turned on while shooting at you which is why zarya sees so much play at all levels
Overwatch,not_removed,they stay up for seconds but have health after they receive damage they go down but they cancel out all damage if theyre still up so if youre shielded and damaged for then – youre dead but if youre damaged for then – not a scratch beam gets charged for a maximum of if a shield is fully stripped by damage and the charge goes down on its own over time faster if youre firing best use is when you or the teammate is focused and you know theyre about to receive a lot of damage – its a tool for your dps as well as protection can be a livesaver for some ults dva junkrat but wont do that much for others hanzo pharah one specific tip is dont put the shield on before engaging the enemy – theyll just not fire at you get in there take damage or so your blue hp can take it and regenerate then pop it for more charge
Overwatch,not_removed,melee has three functions execute someone at or below health tag someone with an extra damage before jumping out of the fight most common on genji and tracer damage someone behind reinhardtwinston barriers without having to actually get past it
Overwatch,not_removed,its anyone i played with a few people who have already completed their matches
Overwatch,not_removed,almost all players are having problems
Overwatch,not_removed,everyone httpstwittercomblizzardcs states ddos
Overwatch,not_removed,junkrat seems work well against it in my experience bombs over the shield or even throwing your mine to knock the reinhardt upaway into the air so your team can shoot the bastion also flankers like genji and tracer can work well if you go in sneakybeaky like
Overwatch,not_removed,dva ult hanzo ult will take out everything but the torb turret
Overwatch,not_removed,symmetra works surprisingly well
Overwatch,not_removed,dva can destroy projectiles that can pass thro barriers reins flame strike symms rmb while rein can block zaryas lmb and symms lmb edit for dvas defense matrix its pretty much within all the red lines you see
Overwatch,not_removed,lucio and zen are the big support combo however that is before zen got his discord reduced from to and mercy got her heals buffed from to so far we havent seen how that will effect the meta but people are playing more mercy lucio is generally always considered a required pick because hes the only person who can speed boost and the only person who can aoe heal outside of anas grenade reinhardt is considered an almost required pick except on koth maps winston is almost always picked on koth zarya is picked a lot
Overwatch,not_removed,that does still seem to be the setup people are using on ptr right now i think they did a great job balancing the supports for season lucio will however pretty much always be mandatory simply because no one else can aoe heal and his speed boost is still a great tool hes also so slippery its hard to kill him if he plays smart all the other healers are meant to be single target and are best bets for certain niche scenarios i personally think well see mercy return quite a bit with her season buff shes a fantastic defensive healer zen and ana are both a little more attack oriented i personally like ana a little more since ive gotten pretty good with her rifle and she is an amazing counter to zen with her grenade with good coordination her ult is still just so op im going to be sad when it inevitably gets hit by the nerf bat
Overwatch,not_removed,ideal always depends on the situation will still be the most common setup but i also saw stuff like tanks with roadhog as tankdmg dealer or other comps in the end we all arent pro players so i guess setups dont matter that matchup as long as you have dmg heal and tankiness in there
Overwatch,not_removed,if you are in close range are insanely good at tracking or are up against someone with a huge hitbox looking at you roadhog its better to hold for max dps in other situations like upizzasbypapa said its better to click individually for the best accuracy
Overwatch,not_removed,i find its best not to hold down lmb because often time you havent adjusted your aim enough yet instead i try to wait until im sure i have adjusted enough to their movement to shoot again
Overwatch,not_removed,get zaryas full charge all the time since they cannot hold fire lots of shields to increase survivability right click on high charge deals a lot of damage and its a splash so it will force that disgusting dwarf away from his turret
Overwatch,not_removed,cheese strats are best countered with cheese strats a lot of reinhardts should just be able to block enough dmg to push the payload away from their turrets junkrats can take out turrets from out of site if you know where they are genjis can also take out towers pretty good
Overwatch,not_removed,the most important part in countering torbs is for the whole team to react and adjust quickly if half your team keeps running in and feeding them ult charge it will become a lot harder to counter them others have already mentioned some good heroes to use zarya junk rein genji which is probably your best bet if youre solo queuing and your teammates dont know what to do widow on maps where you can snipe from far away pharah corner peeking or firing from behind a rein shield or dva matrixboost in and nuke everyone with your ult also work exceptionally well ill list some general strategies if you have some level of teamwork going slow push strat dps pharah widow junkrat or even bastion behind rein shields preferably damage boosted by mercy torb turrets do not deal much damage to shields so you should be able to take them out quickly for best results have reins so that one can recharge his shield while the other protects the team rush strat only works on cp maps have a lucio speed boost the whole team past the turrets to the point and make the torbs come to you rein winston mei can protect the team while out in the open countercheese dvas eat torbs alive you can dmatrix boost to the turrets fall back and fire away from long range in gremlin form and pretty much clear out everything with nuke
Overwatch,not_removed,headshots are double damage the exception is widowmaker with her modifier base damage is which is multiplied by her charge charge is is up to being headshot is which amounts to damage so headshot on full charge will kill any hero except tanks thats assuming they dont have torbjorns armor andor symmetras shields
Overwatch,not_removed,hitscan
Overwatch,not_removed,hitscan
Overwatch,not_removed,hitscan
Overwatch,not_removed,that may be a latency issue its supposed to reflect like any other projectile if you deflect it at your feet you should be healed etc
Overwatch,not_removed,it detonated on impact or after queit a while when you throw it straight in the air i guess it depends where or what it hits if it doesnt hit you directly so for example the wall next to you or one of your teammates in front of you you wont be able to deflect the aoe pretty much the same with junkrats primary fire you can deflect it but if it explodes o nthe floor next to you or teammates nearby you wont deflect it but you will take dmg
Overwatch,not_removed,i didnt know they did but presumably because they pass through the shield twice front and back
Overwatch,not_removed,victorydefeat screen
Overwatch,not_removed,whichever button is ice wall press it again on pc for example ice wall is e and placed with left click press e again to rotate
Overwatch,not_removed,probably not i think the assumption is that man was winstons father figure and that he gave winston those glasses both as a gift and because winston needed glasses
Overwatch,not_removed,no other gorillas rose against their keepers in horizon and murdered them including winston the human winston the gorilla probably just adopted his caretakers name to honor him he didnt have any name before when he decided to escape from the moon
Overwatch,not_removed,reinheart is getting new legendary ones everyone is getting an emote dvas is legendary
Overwatch,not_removed,you seem new to reddit you wanna press the reply button under a comment and type in there so that person hears it name wont get them
Overwatch,not_removed,just your team and even your team wont hear the plea for healing if theyre not healers
Overwatch,not_removed,then god has abandoned us
Overwatch,not_removed,saving this for future reference
Overwatch,not_removed,i mean like you said reaper is meant to be a counter to tanks the question is like how do i beat pharah as junkrat its not impossible but its an uphill battle my suggestion would be to make sure youre not too far from your teammates reaper does a lot of burst damage but it still takes a good seconds for him to kill a reinhardt even if hes landing every shot if youve got backup you can probably wipe him before he can kill you
Overwatch,not_removed,theres not much you can do i try to firestrike or pin him from a distance if the reapers smart hell run away or pick up a health pack and stop bothering you also stay near your teammates and hope they kill him before he gets too close
Overwatch,not_removed,reinhardt is one of my most played and basically theres not much you can do about it the best thing you can do is make your team aware of his existence and acknowledge the fact that you cant be effective as long as hes on you your team will need to pick a counter character andor make sure to focus him this is probably pretty tough to do in quick play so just remember that the game is about having fun so if youre team cant advance as a result to you being killed so often by reaper just switch to a nontank character ive been lucky enough sometimes that switching to a reaper counter has caused someone on my team to switch to rein once they noticed there was no longer a giant blue wall protecting them tldr depend on your teammates because hes your counter and theres really nothing you as reinhardt can do about it
Overwatch,not_removed,if you do melee firestrike fast it should do some decent damage on him if hes low or you have some backup thats a solid option could always try to surprise charge him if youre alone
Overwatch,not_removed,a few of the hotkey crosshair interactions for all of these you need to press a binding and not use the expression wheel looking at the point and pressing understood will make you say attackdefend the objective looking at a healerzaryatorbsyemmtra and pressing i need healing will say i need healinga barrierarmourshields looking at a teammate and pressing group up with me says i have your back to the teammate looking at a teammate and pressing ultimate status says my ultimate is ready lets do this to the teammate pressing thanks after getting healed makes your healer appreciate you more and might help them not get so tilted from the other members of the team playing poorly for what buttons trigger what functions you should go into your controls and check it out you have to scroll down pretty far to get all of the communication lines
Overwatch,not_removed,ctrlshiftr i believe
Overwatch,not_removed,stop hitting random keys and check the keybindings in your settings it shows you what is what there considering theyre customizable i doubt anybody who cared enough to create a picture would have the defaults i know h is acknowledge which switches to get on the point if your cursor is pointed at the point marker x is need healthshieldsarmor depending on if youre pointing to someone the rest ive rebound to number keys
Overwatch,not_removed,roverwatchlft
Overwatch,not_removed,some general tips her boost is not just a sprint it does damage and you should use it to disrupt enemies whenever you can get in their faces especially if theyre trying to pop an ult boost shield matrix is very useful against mccree roadhog pharah etc her guns do a lot of damage up close but the drop off is insane so from far away its more of a tickle so you have to do a lot of up close personal fighting unfortunately her whole front is a crit spot so make use of defense matrix and dont be afraid to use boost to leave to get a health packregroup but yeah imo dva is there to disrupt aggro ad protect your teammates from short bursts of bullshit defense matrix can allow you to shield your team whilst they take out an enemy bastion for example and dva can take down torb turrets by herself usually as for her ult this is a tricky one its enturely possible to use it just as her mech is destroyed and it can be a viable tactic to do that just so you can get a new mech and stay in the fight other times youll want to wait for a better opportunity but these are all situational its pretty easy to hide behind a payload to avoid her ult though you can use her newfound invincibility to shoot people who are distracted hiding yourself and some areas just have too many hiding places its often good to boost the mech up into the air but again nothing guaranteed it feels like luck a lot of the time sometimes you just need to use it for area denial this can make or break a match in overtime but be aware that reins shield and meis wall can block it expect to lose your mech a lot as dva but her second life is actually really useful her pistol does a decent bit of damage and shes a much smaller target than her mech use the gremlin form to pop a few shots at unaware enemies and either contest the point or fall back and regroup of course shes super squishy in this form so look out its possible to get killed as you enter your mech this has happened to me far too many times so be wary of your situation when you call it dva gets pretty messed up by zarya reinhardt and mei so its not always the best idea to pick her in fights with these guys present reaper is an antitank so keep an eye out for him when you can and be careful around hanzo those arrows can do a ridiculous amount of damage and ruin your mech in a few hits symm can be a problem too depending on the situation but less so than the others please dont try and engage reinhardt in close range you will die hope this is of some help
Overwatch,not_removed,she excels at hit and run tactics imo make liberal use of her boosters to quickly close the distance on your opponents put your defense matrix up if they see you coming then boost away when things get too hot she is great vs snipers and turrets especially her defense matrix will also eat many ultimates so be ready to catch them as soon as you hear the callout
Overwatch,not_removed,dva is the most mobile tank by a large margin her boosters basically have no cooldown and last a long time theyre good for engaging and theyre good for disengaging boost into the enemy and youll do damage and knock them back which is exactly what you want from her her shotguns are very powerful at taking down enemies at close range they can absolutely shred with proper tracking its not good at long range but you have boosters to rectify that her defence matrix since the recent buff basically defines her now she can put it up at a moments notice and counter ults when you see the opposing team get ready for their big play you can counter it as if you were reinhardt pharah tracer mccree zarya a lot of ults get eaten by dva you can also combine dm with her boosters as dm does not cancel boosters or vice versa this can be good for rushing into some opponents and disrupting them if you can focusisolate some out of position squishy enemies like a widowmaker you will generally win the as long as youre decently healed when you start the fight take down the healer and everything is easier dva can block shes mobile she has got decent damage and shes very good at being a pest youve got to take elements from three tanks to play her well zaryas willingness to fight reinhardts protective abilities and winstons disruption but shes actually fairly low skill floor when you start doing well with her boosters and coordinating boostingdm with your team as for her ult its mostly for getting people to run away not for kills but kills are nice
Overwatch,not_removed,anything genji can reflect dva can delete
Overwatch,not_removed,yes as can zaryas ult soldiers healing thing
Overwatch,not_removed,of course if its not pinned then itll be at the top right corner when on desktop in the important box dont expect any patch until september though
Overwatch,not_removed,rightclick the speaker icon on your computer taskbar press playback devices find your headset and rightclick it click set as default communications device if i remember that should fix it
Overwatch,not_removed,your speakers might be set as your default communication device
Overwatch,not_removed,yes it effects both her fires
Overwatch,not_removed,increased aoe as well as damage
Overwatch,not_removed,im guessing this is genji
Overwatch,not_removed,no
Overwatch,not_removed,its when blizzard usually has maintenence and patches other games ie hearthstone
Overwatch,not_removed,blizzard does this because its the best day of the week to release new content doing it on tuesday allows you to prepare for the release on monday release on tuesday and then have days on fixing bugs and other issues before the weekend this will also reduce server strain as the most hardcore fans will play it just after release midweek while the casual hordes will come on friday when theyre done with work before the weekend
Overwatch,not_removed,as a more general rule you dont want to update a major software product on say friday because you want to be ready to handle problems arising from the new patch as soon as possible and not have to deal with it over the weekend instead
Overwatch,not_removed,i heard its best to not actually kill the enemies yourself but rather throw the discord on an enemy than switch to another that is about to die the actual realistic approach however is to befriend the enemy team with waves and shit then ask in allchat for help
Overwatch,not_removed,but that genji with deflect kill deserves it so much more s
Overwatch,not_removed,if you have a computer monitor that has x physical pixels and you set your computer to the recommended resolution your desktop will be rendered as x pixels every frame and every pixel in the frame will correspond to a pixel on the monitor if you set overwatch to only render a scaled down resolution your computer will only make x x x pixels then preform a scaling algorithm on the picture its the same as when you try to watch a youtube video on a monitor that was made after chrome knows you have a larger monitor and youtube knows you have a larger monitor but it is choosing to show you only so many pixels that it stretches to fit the screen edit formatting
Overwatch,not_removed,it pretty much decides if the game gets sclaed onto another resolution or not means you play the game without scaling so you play it in the resolution you set int the options lets say but if you use a render scale the internal resolution would actually be and the game would upscale it to of course upscaling comes with loss of quality and its mostly a feautre for people with high resolutions and bad pcs or with strange resolutions
Overwatch,not_removed,think of it as an internal resolution if you set it to for example the game will actually be running at half your screen resolution and simply be upscaled on the other hand would have the game run at twice your resolution and downsize it for the display lower settings will reduce graphics quality but increase performance whereas high setting will do the exact opposite the main difference between lowering render scale or lowering the actual screen resolution is that the render scale does not affect the ui elements those will always use your actual screen resolution
Overwatch,not_removed,ive played about hours of mei and i can safely say ive been able to shoot two icicles into a frozen target only a handful of times the problem is not with skill at mei but with the servers regarding freezing times theres actually a pretty wide variance of when the server will actually freeze the target and how long they will stay frozen you must have ameizing ping if youre able to consistently get two icicles in however i will say that two icicles isnt really necessary the iciclemelee combo takes out the majority of nontank players and you dont really want to be face to face with tanks after their frozen because two icicles or not youre not going to kill them and theyre going to be angry the only exception to this is zarya who has the lowest health of the tanks i will say though that zarya is a pretty nasty counter to mei as a good zarya will wait til theyre almost frozen then pop their bubble which nullifies it then blast you in the face because youre standing their point blank trying to freeze them
Overwatch,not_removed,nope you cant this is a design decision by blizzard to prevent people single out players that didnt do well and flame them the only thing where you can see some stats is the end screen where you can vote for some stuff you can also conclude some stuff grom your own medals like having gold in healing as roadhog with healers in the team
Overwatch,not_removed,the genji wont take damage but it wont damage you either and yes a winston shield can stop a self destruct
Overwatch,not_removed,genji grabs your hand and hits you with it while yelling stop hitting yourself
Overwatch,not_removed,genji block it but dont reflect the dmg winston shield does stop it
Overwatch,not_removed,genji cant reflect melee attacks but he blocks them instead
Overwatch,not_removed,check that mouse acceleration isnt on
Overwatch,not_removed,the battlenet launcher starts downloading the patch before it comes out so that when it is released it just installs the patch and doesnt have to wait to download it this also lightens the load on blizzards servers as they can have everyone slowly downloading the patch over a few daysweek instead of bum rushing their servers the moment they go live with the patch
Overwatch,not_removed,he might have been talking about the ptr which is where blizz trial out their new patches before putting into the live servers
Overwatch,not_removed,the best thing that i always say is be okay with changing heroes after your first death if they have winstonreinzarya saying if both their tanks are one of those three then someone like genji or tracer will melt in front of them dont just stay a hero that is getting countered because you like them the most switch to mcree or to really pound their tanks down and demolish reins shield from far away or go for reaper to kill them faster than they can kill you im not saying a skilled tracer or genji couldnt handle them and you may be very good with tracergenji but if they are as skilled with their hero as you are with yours then you are at a disadvantage from the start i also just used tracer and genji as examples for this but everyone has a hard counter or two
Overwatch,not_removed,health white is neutral an attack dealing damage takes away health which can be restored through hero abilities and health packs shields blue function the same as health but will recharge after a period of taking damage so damage on shields will be healed automatically and without the need for abilities armor yellow is the most complex one armor will halve the damage an attack does up to removing damage so a damage attack deals but an damage attack would deal the difference is mostly unnoticeable tending to only have a strong effect on the damage taken from shotguns as each pellet is reduced and winstons tesla cannon low damage per shot armor like health needs the use of abilities or health packs to be healed if youre still confused id be willing to further elaborate
Overwatch,not_removed,theres a few quick tricks for marginal improvements try switching to a green dot crosshair and a lower sensitivity but the best way to improve accuracy is just to practice my favorite way to practice is something i picked up here start a custom game fill the enemy team with hard ana bots set it to skirmish mode headshots only damage optional then just play in that mode with whoever you want to improve aim on i recommend mccree for general aim practice after of that youll feel a noticeable improvement do it with some regularity and its even better
Overwatch,not_removed,yes you still healspeed boost
Overwatch,not_removed,dont go near her shes like the pyro of yes she has ranged damage in the form of her icicle blast and her wall can still block you but as long as you dont go near her she cant freeze you especially if youre a tank try to keep your distance since she can freeze tanks pretty effectively also if you keep moving you can become incredibly hard to freeze if the mei isnt ameizing at aiming trying to freeze a lucio with speed boost or a gengi thats double jumping around can be incredibly difficult even in close quarters finally dont wander around solo as long as there is a teammate nearby her ability to freeze you is reduced since hopefully the teammate will shoot at her and make her life difficult
Overwatch,not_removed,this upcoming tuesday september
Overwatch,not_removed,couple of things in general flankers should be you know flanking a flanker sitting on the point is a wasted pick theyre be better off on a general dps or a tank snipers as well are rarely doing their job if theyre directly on the point when on defense you should be trying to hold choke points not necessarily the objective take temple of anubis point a for example your team should be stopping them at that first gate not sitting back on the point itself remember the cap speed increase is only for up to characters and it only takes one defender to contest any more on the point itself arent actually contributing to takingholding if youre about the win the game its worth having at least some of your team push out far to keep the enemy from reaching the point to contest it
Overwatch,not_removed,mine shows the same thing a hunch is that majority of people who use overbuff might be the types that are more focused on zipping around getting kills than sitting on the point but thats speculation and stereotyping

Overwatch,not_removed,against most targets its probably just worth body shooting hook bodyshot melee already does enough damage and if the target has a small head like tracer you may end up missing loads of pellets if you aim too far up just aim for the torso area and youll find some pellets head shot anyway and its a more reliable way to land all the pellets
Overwatch,not_removed,different people treat quickplay in different ways some play just for fun others try to improve their skills on heroes they are less familiar with and some others play for the win the biggest issue is that right now between competitive seasons its the only game mode to make things worse people who climbed the competitive ladder more than likely have a lower quickplay mmr so are matched up with lower skilled people that and some people are just plain jerks wanting to win is one thing but calling your team retards when they dont set up the initial defense according to the pro meta is another
Overwatch,not_removed,stacked bunched up grouped up or just putting all the good stuff on one pile in terms of quickplay hero stacking refers to when you have multiple of a single hero to give yourself an advantage in terms of teams and the competitive level team stacking is when you put many good players on one team relative to the rest say there were teams of and there were good players total in these youd expect there to be good players on each team stacking is when you have good players on one team all the good stuff in a single pile
Overwatch,not_removed,stacked means really good a lot of good players stacked together
Overwatch,not_removed,female gamers make up for in us whereas most gamers are male in the uk polling and research on games arent very prevalent in asian countries so you wont find much detail there ive done reports on this topic before for my school and i have never found any worthwhile research concerning asia so the answer is that its hard to say
Overwatch,not_removed,i dont think its too bad while it definitely has the oh shit now i have to kill her again vibe its a very suboptimal use of her ult static nukes are easy to dodge even with the second timer i personally only ever deathbomb in an emergency eg dying on the point in overtime
Overwatch,not_removed,when she does that she is usually not in an optimal position and is easy to dodge while she may get a new mech compare that to ults that can bring the whole team back to life heroes with shielding abilities like mei and zarya her counters can even kill her while shes out of her mech and then shield for a completely wasted ult
Overwatch,not_removed,not many people use their mics in quick play especially in the lower levels competitive unlocks at level but there is no competitive play right now as were in between seasons it will be back on september
Overwatch,not_removed,if you never hear anyone talking make sure you have your chat set to automatically join instead of being just on i was having the same issue where i never heard anyone talking but that seemed to fix it
Overwatch,not_removed,is this normal is it because its quick play yes people just want to mess around practice unfamiliar heroes or only talk among ourselves in group chat my friends and i usually dont care about randoms because they are most likely going to rage over nothing havent actually seen another mode besides quick play or brawl rank is coming back sept you need to be level to access it
Overwatch,not_removed,theres a break between competitive seasons going on right now season starts next week and i think you need to be level or something before you can actually do competitive as for mics theres often a lot more communication in competitive games and i have noticed that quick play has been relatively silent recently
Overwatch,not_removed,to add to what other said everything that genji reflects becomes pretty much his own projectile with any effects that comes with it like you said anas heal but also the knockback on roadhogs ult the oneshot of mc crees ult and so on this is why genji is pretty much the only character that is able to get achivements from other characters for example the nap time achivement from ana where she has to put someone during his ult to sleep can be done by reflecting a sleeping dart onto an ulting target
Overwatch,not_removed,yep converts the dart to a friendly projectile and works the same way genji can be a healer too
Overwatch,not_removed,yes as if genji shot his own dart
Overwatch,not_removed,he is a defense hero and the explanation of those fits him pretty well in my opinion the main objective of the defense role is to guard locations create choke points and establish a front they may have long range weapons or the ability to create turrets and excel at area denial if you hold an objective or you pretty much can wait for the enemies to come to you junkrat makes getting there very very hard he doenst have the best aim but he has huge amounts of aoe dmg and aoe control i wouldnt say his role is getting kills but its easy to get kills on low life targets with your aoe or poke them low enough for your team to kill them he can also take out a reinhardt shield pretty fast while being extremly safe if you have a chokepoint you have to get through and there is a good junkrat guarding that chokepoint you will have a hard time getting through
Overwatch,not_removed,well according to cranky enemies junkrat is supposed to precisely aim his grenades to impact directly without ever touching a wall or ground and he should never use angles to bounce around corners or generally litter the ground with little explosions to slow an attacks advance also dont arch them from cover to destroy turrets and bastions apparently all of those things make you a junkrat noaim scrub hes also fun for helping to quickly shatter reins shield
Overwatch,not_removed,being a nuisance hes there to flank and pick off enemies that are already low on health to clear out clumps of enemies and take out turrets or bastions because his grenade has an arc that can reach enemies without enemies seeing him hes good against torbjorn and camping bastions if you see them before they see you
Overwatch,not_removed,area denial spamming the way so the enemy is having a hard time going through it
Overwatch,not_removed,the difference is huge low dpi and sensitivity allow for much smoother aiming and precision please lower your settings zenyatta will thank you
Overwatch,not_removed,afraid not
Overwatch,not_removed,as far as i know they are completly separated like different battlenet accounts maybe there is a non official way when you mail the blizzard support but i dont know any official way to do this
Overwatch,not_removed,yesterday jeff kaplan the patch will be soon but we dont have an exact date considering that competitive season is scheduled to start on september the patch should go live by that time at the latest
Overwatch,not_removed,pharah to boop reinhardt away dva is superb because matrix is op in general rush them wm cant do anything about it and you cant take the bastion fire for long
Overwatch,not_removed,its just random although i dont think every character has an interacting conversation with every other character
Overwatch,not_removed,the usual combo is blink close to an enemy stick it to them and recall away
Overwatch,not_removed,whats your goal multikill bombs or accurate sticky bombs
Overwatch,not_removed,dont wait for the wombocombo just try to single out one or two enemies toss it and recall its the same thing with high noon its better to try to get or than to save it for a juicy quad kill
Overwatch,not_removed,the potg engine is the same as the normal engine but it is only given so much time to load if you have ever experienced the issue of character models not appearing even though you are walking through the map it is the same thing if the potg were given more time to load they would appear eventually try lowering your settings and replaying as for the sprays thats just a known bug unfortunately
Overwatch,not_removed,blizzard has servers in sydney open battle net launcher click the battle net icon in the top left and click settings a new window should open click game settings and all your battle net games will appear find overwatch and tick the button additional command line arguments and in the new command line text box put the following if you do this then apply and close the game when matchmaking will only match you in aus servers and never us servers if there is no aus servers queue will take longer or go forever if it never puts you in a game you have to untick the command line box and disable it to at least play on us servers
Overwatch,not_removed,i think its averaged out like normal player stats say you play half the game as pharah in your stats that map would still list a performance as damage as it scales it out thats how someone has ridiculously high stats as some characters they did well for seconds then switched and those seconds average out over the entire game it should be averaged out
Overwatch,not_removed,you play pharah and get damage the average pharah damage for that map for your skill level is you get bonus skill rank the thing is amount of bonus rank points you get from this is very very small from my experience it in the range of of total point you get time spent on fire has much more impact and isnt affected by swapping heroes if youre able to perform well so i wouldnt worry too much about switching midgame
Overwatch,not_removed,itd be a bit ridiculous because in a small corridor situation one deflect elim can snowball and then the genji would just be deflecting over and over again
Overwatch,not_removed,i cant help you with fixing that but you should probably report this bug to blizzard
Overwatch,not_removed,lowering your settings could be one and the only option its a known issue tho
Overwatch,not_removed,the answer is pretty simple custom games a typical work day for pro players is at least lets say hours long a lot of that is team meetings analysis amd stuff like that eg hours another big part is praticing hours most of that happens in custom games practicing special mechanics over and over again cant really be done in a normal game also skrims playing against other team for training purpose are also custom games after that there isnt much time to play ranked and a lot of pros dont like to do it afterwards also not everyone that is good in a team enviroment is also good on soloqueue edit another thing is that a lot of pros that stream tend to play for fun and dont try hard they pick what the community voted for and not whats best
Overwatch,not_removed,i guess mostly because they are pro level players from other games like csgo and and the fps skills are pretty transferable also natural talent plays a part some people are good a soccer and some arent for example plus the fact that the say casual hours ive put in is nothing compared to the intense training hours they have put in oh and also level does not reflect training with botspractice rangecustom gamesout of game strategy learning
Overwatch,not_removed,you wont get banned for reporting anyone especially in good faith
Overwatch,not_removed,if you dont excessivly report people there shouldnt be a problem the only penalty i can think about is giving your reports less value but as i said thats when you report a lot also blizzard bans noone just because you report someone they will take a look at it and see if they used an aimbot or not so you do nothing more than a suggestion to blizzard to take a look at a player blizzard knows that you can pnly report conspicuous behaviour and cant say for sure if someone is cheating
Overwatch,not_removed,maybe lowering texturemodel detail dont really know if it will make a noticable difference
Overwatch,not_removed,there is no projectile when ana is casting her ult so no
Overwatch,not_removed,we dont know yet
Overwatch,not_removed,all we know is that itll come out before or on the of september
Overwatch,not_removed,since comp season is coming on the i would assume the new patch would be live the same day
Overwatch,not_removed,most likely on tuesday
Overwatch,not_removed,i may be wrong but reaper tracer bastion reinhardt winston symmetra
Overwatch,not_removed,theres a key binding for toggle ui at the very bottom of the configuration menu i believe its set to altz by default on pc not sure what its set to on consoles
Overwatch,not_removed,i wonder when you die do you relax and just treat the respawn timer as a waiting period before you can get back into the game this sounds like it might be a difference in mindsets when i die my focus is almost always still in the game sometimes i skip the killcam and spectate my team members so i can get an idea of the overall fight for when i rejoin if you know you have a mercy on your team spectating her could be a good improvement if you press tab to view the list of players you can see whether or not characters have a fully charged ult
Overwatch,not_removed,happens to me all the time with an uncommunicative mercy
Overwatch,not_removed,i mean there is an invulnerability period of seconds so theres no excuse really
Overwatch,not_removed,i cant tell you how many times i went for a drink when i died heard the heroes never die and spilled my drink all over myself frantically trying to get back on the game
Overwatch,not_removed,toblerone is a swiss chocolate the name is commonly used as a play on torbjorns name
Overwatch,not_removed,its a fan name for torbjorn
Overwatch,not_removed,torbjorn
Overwatch,not_removed,you are comfortable with him on attack good find a good spot to defend this spot is your payload you are on attack now
Overwatch,not_removed,play him like you would on attack but less aggressively a defenders life is worth far more than an attackers life your death could mean losing the point that means fewer yolo charges save your ult for when you really need it to counter their ults generally
Overwatch,not_removed,stand right behind the choke point and hope your team is behind you if you have a mic tell your team when your shield is about to go out take cover while your shield recharges and if you can wait until if fully recharges if there isnt any activity at the choke point take your shield down if it needs to be charged
Overwatch,not_removed,play him same as attack protect healer with shield fire strike when bunch grouped up charge the enemy rein when he holds up his shield so you can give your team the chance to kill the weaker charactersthis may result in your death when genji ults just swing at his ass times youll win just remember your a moving wall and not a bad staller you can cnx dvas mccree reinhardt ult with you shield also use hammer down alot more even if its only two people if you can take out the support your golden sorry for the spazness of this reply im at work on my phone have any more questions about rein id be happy to go into more detail i main rein
Overwatch,not_removed,the exact date is unknown iirc however they stated that reach season will last for about an actual season spring summer fall winter so each season should last around months
Overwatch,not_removed,sometime around midnovember i think
Overwatch,not_removed,you have to readd them on the ptr
Overwatch,not_removed,its completely based on preference try out crazy settings and see which feels the most comfortable i use send horizontal and vertical but my friend literally uses and has better aim than me depends on what your reactions are like i guess just try same with jump i use x but i have lucios and x swapped so i can look around whilst wall riding my friend does this with mercy too for optimised healing and guardian angel just try out different stuff and stick with whats best for you
Overwatch,not_removed,qualifiers are in septembers cup is during blizzcon in november
Overwatch,not_removed,yea that sounds really high to me
Overwatch,not_removed,no there are a couple that have major traits of chars mercy having the heal beam from medic for example but i would say many of them are unique in their own right no char from is a massive german with a rocket powered hammer
Overwatch,not_removed,some are very obviously inspired to various extents junkrat mercy symmetra bastion mei tracer but others take mechanics seen in other games and genres as someone who played a lot of dva lúcio zarya winston genji ana feel quite fresh for example roadhog is more like a moba character reaper too others are just different takes on core genre classes id say mercy and junkrat are the major class overhauls and symtorb also very similar feeling mei has the old puff and sting going on but its not as rapid and shes more focused on area denial and cc than damage the others the weapon might feel the same or the general pattern of play but there are really key differences
Overwatch,not_removed,not really has characters compared to overwatchs and counting there are some superficial similarities mercymedics heal beam junkratdemomans grenade launcher etc but when you dig in the similarities end in addition to more characters each one of overwatchs characters have much more complexity than example medic has his heal his syringe gun melee and the ubercharge mercy on the other hand has heal beam damage boost beam pistol melee a dash to allies and a resurrection
Overwatch,not_removed,despite what this subreddit may have you believe overwatch actually has an excellent matchmaking system it will automatically sort you into games based on your skill level so most people wind up with a winrate of very close to you will certainly get stomped at some point because that happens to even the best players but you wont be consistently outclassed
Overwatch,not_removed,from what ive heard the xbox community is somewhat dead isnt bad but the main scene is on pc you will not get pro stomped at least not commonly the games matchmaking is pretty good so you will generally be playing against people with roughly the same experience and skill level
Overwatch,not_removed,grab a few and play competitive once the season starts thats really all there is make sure to press p and switch to team voice chat when in a group the game defaults to group voice chat making you unable to hear nongroup players
Overwatch,not_removed,im in this position right now work on communication keep the group talking constantly make callouts dont be afraid to comment on your teammates gameplay if they are doing something wrong then let them know everyone involved needs to be able to take criticism yourself included as far as the meta goes right now we are looking at attack tank support this might change in season ranked youre going to want people who specialize in those specific roles when youre queueing people the necessity of being able to play each role diminishes and in turn the necessity of being able to do really well in one role increases talk to your teammates and have everyone agree on their roles all thats left is to practice tldr each person needs to specialize in a role constantly communicate
Overwatch,not_removed,in my experience either far away she acts more like a traditional snipers in the thick shes primarily firing from the hip
Overwatch,not_removed,i like medium depth but position to the sides it gives good diagonals to shoot both frontline and backline so you can hit your intended target instead of a random teammate avoid situations where any teammate is blocked by another
Overwatch,not_removed,yes hero specific cards have really high piority
Overwatch,not_removed,try the
Overwatch,not_removed,i would love to play ive been looking for teamates
Overwatch,not_removed,dont think so
Overwatch,not_removed,no
Overwatch,not_removed,there are two ways to improve in this game mechanical skill if you can hit a headshot every time mccree pulls the trigger you will win every game not even taimou who has been accused of aimbotting and has aiming that looks like this can do this consistently theres always room for improvement gamesense and this is a very big topic and the most important thing to learn the most important thing when it comes to improving is to record every death you have step back and ask yourself why you died did you get caught out of position did you simply get outgunned do they simply counter you learn how to improve in this regard learn how to not die next time whether its retreating earlier whether its not chasing that kill whether its paying more attention to their mccree anything you can do to improve for next time team composition and who you play really does matter what map youre on what the enemy is playing and what your team comp is like the best genji in the world cannot heal learning lucio goes a long way to winning games learn to fill the gaps in your team likewise the enemy does counter if they have a good reaper roadhog isnt the best option a good mccreewidow probably should swap off of pharah counterpick so you can die less and kill someone more communication always talk to your team always try to coordinate a push together dont trickle in one at a time its better to all go in at once rather than going in one at a time in professional play a bad decision that everyone does is better than a good decision that nobody does same for the lower ranks map knowledge and positioning take the high ground control the big health kit if youre in a one vs one with an enemy try to position yourself between the medkit and them makes it a lot harder for them to get it and it can really turn the fight around you can always drop onto the low ground but climbing onto the high ground is hard by being above you expand los make it easier to shoot shooting down is easier make it harder to be shot this game has a lot of subtle things you can do to improve a lot of it comes down to playing the game more in competitive play you might want to play with a friend so you have at least marginal coordination if you dont have a friend try to find someone online you enjoyed playing with tldr learn how to position yourself make sure youre picking the right heroes and always ask yourself how to improve when you die
Overwatch,not_removed,switch characters often if your team doesnt have a tank or a support switch to one of them if your team only has one tank or support switch to one of them then too if someone on the enemy team is kicking your ass switch to their counter switch switch switch never ever ever be toxic in chat offering criticism or giving orders even when phrased nicely will trigger toxicity in teammates dont ever critique someone elses pick even if its something idiotic like torbjorn on attack gentle nonspecific suggestions three snipers may be too many or we could really use some more offense are the most direct your instructions to teammates should ever be learn about ultimate economy understand why constantly building turrets that get immediately destroyed as torb is a bad thing understand how using your ult to secure a team kill when the battle was already won is a bad thing understand why trading one ult for an enemys can be a bad or good thing depending on which ults were traded
Overwatch,not_removed,you know not really im actually quite surprised at the way this game is being handled by its creatorsteam the only troublesome thing as other people have mentioned is that if youre a big cosmetics person then the future doesnt seem all that promising im used to being able to throw money at a screen to get costumes and the fact that i missed almost all of the summer games due to my work is pretty annoying you wont be able to get them again until same time next year and theyre all from loot boxes you cant buy any with regular credits but as far as the community and gameplay goes i see nothing but a bright future with the game if things continue i think theyre biggest challenge is going to be staying relevant with new characters and maps but there is certainly enough there right now to get your moneys worth hope you enjoy it
Overwatch,not_removed,only economy wise they just finished an event where you had to buy loot boxes to get the items from that event and duplicates gave you credits which you couldnt use to purchase the items in the loot box like you can with the classic items its a little worrying but it doesnt affect the game play and the sheer amount of crap it got in the community might steer them away from using the system again
Overwatch,not_removed,but mccrees stun doesnt knock bastion out of turret mode does it
Overwatch,not_removed,agreed this happened to me just the other day and i was super surprised considering he sends everyone else flying
Overwatch,not_removed,i think its working against roadhog bastion is probably in the back line and not roadhogs first target in mind giving bastion ample time to mow the ult down
Overwatch,not_removed,roadhog is basically a high health offense hero that cant move as fast
Overwatch,not_removed,his hook is also a problem for anyone who has a slightly higher ping than the person playing rh if you have a lower ping than rh you can sometimes get out of the stun before he shoots but if you have a higher ping its a losing effort
Overwatch,not_removed,darn i havent practiced my doge in a while
Overwatch,not_removed,meanwhile they also need to fix the pulled to the side bug
Overwatch,not_removed,i was actually playing junkrat i was either sniped by ana or cut down by genji who is too fast to hit while dodging anas bullets and the occasional firestrikes or tobleron shots we had a reinhardt but his shield melted in sec and he died early it was aort of a lock down im not sure how to explain thia
Overwatch,not_removed,maybe team coordination is the real issue i mostly play solo feelsbadman and sometimes get a non coordinated team but no one ever comunicates including myself actually i dont really like talking in the infame voice channel even though we signaled about ults we couldnt beat so many bullets from so many directions
Overwatch,not_removed,same ive been spoiled by competitive play if i see cheesy stacks in qp i just apologize to my team and leave those stacks were fun the first few weeks of the game but im done with all that now it ruins the fun in a lot of cases except for the people who started the cheese
Overwatch,not_removed,are you serious altenter swaps window and full screen
Overwatch,not_removed,i feel enlightened zenyatta thank you so much
Overwatch,not_removed,this is correct if roadhog holds the fire button down while hook animation goes then he should fire first the same goes for you as zarya if you hold down shift after being pulled and roadhog just spams lmb then your shield will pop first most of the time
Overwatch,not_removed,reapers nonchalant clearing the area always cracks me up its just such a weird thing for such an intense character to say while ulting
Overwatch,not_removed,isnt friendly zenyatta experience tranquility
Overwatch,not_removed,roadhog is enjoying his ult too much to crank out a one liner
Overwatch,not_removed,doesnt widow also have alternate voicelines for the huntress and variant skin i remember that the friendly is no one can hide from the huntress but not sure on the enemy one
Overwatch,not_removed,usa usa usa usa usa
Overwatch,not_removed,thanks theres no one page that list them all together
Overwatch,not_removed,fyi the guy in the limo is halfred glitchbot an omnic movie director who directed they came from beyond the moon which is that alien squid poster movie you can find somewhere in the map forgot exactly where though
Overwatch,not_removed,ill actually nano a tank if theyre low on hp and im on my grenade cd if were in a fight itll give them that extra lasting power in critical fights while i get my grenade off cd
Overwatch,not_removed,thanks ive learned its best to use the grenade prior to fights on groups of allies but i gotta get better at healing myself cuz im no use dead also whats a good average accuracy
Overwatch,not_removed,did a whole lot better with widow before he changed it i run a lot of d va because of the spread of her fusion cannons would it be easier for me with her hud
Overwatch,not_removed,is a great choice if the player has played shooters before but it is quite difficult for people new to shooters he has two different kinds of aiming he needs situational awareness to heal others and disicionmaking wether to heal run or fight it is a great char and if you have basic knowledge of shooters you will do well with him but i would not advice him to brandnew shooters i would say lucio every lucio is the to go char for ppl new to shooters
Overwatch,not_removed,yea her grapple is so bad and buggy wish there it had something like reaper teleport indicator
Overwatch,not_removed,currently competitive only differs to quick play in that you can only choose of each hero control maps are best of and payloadassaulthybrid maps have different arrangements you always play both sides once this is what i was looking for thank you very much
Overwatch,not_removed,thanks guess ill have an opening party tonight then
Overwatch,not_removed,going off of the gamepedia article winstons tesla cannon does dps all quick melee moves except dragonblade torb hammer and reinhardt do damage with a second cooldown winstons primary fire is going to do more dps but quick melee can be used as a finisher to secure a kill faster or if youre out of ammo httpoverwatchgamepediacomwinston
Overwatch,not_removed,this unless the symmetra fires from half a map away rein cant dodge her balls without lowering his shield not without a lucio speed boost at least
Overwatch,not_removed,the hardest part about this is his loud as fuck footsteps its so hard to sneak up on someone who actually listens its great fun when playing against people that are totally oblivious though
Overwatch,not_removed,exactly what inspired this question ty
Overwatch,not_removed,stacking dva is funny the opposing team will laugh themselves silly while they win
Overwatch,not_removed,considering im only level there yeah but still i lost every game to teams that played the objective while my team was literally not trying to they would get plenty of cards for kills and all that just no objective play at all i tried to communicate but one guy plugged his mic in just to tell me to f off with my competitiveness winning is the point of the game dude
Overwatch,not_removed,think before you use harmony on widow and hanzo especially if their position hasnt been spotted yet some days give you an epiphany never thought of that thanks
Overwatch,not_removed,ana has a magnet sort of effect on allies when zoomed in
Overwatch,not_removed,im not op but im better at ana than zen when it comes to aiming unscoped and i think scoped accuracy vs odd with zen anas projectiles feel like they travel faster which makes it far easier to hit
Overwatch,not_removed,in color scheme its closer to gundam astray blue frame d but id say its just a reference to mecha in general with a heavy gundam influence of course not any specific model
Overwatch,not_removed,this whenever possible you want to use your jump pack and bubble shield at the same time figuring out how to move in and out of your bubble as enemies do the same is crucial winston is largely a disruptive tank due to his lower damage but great aoe spread also jump up and down a lot
Overwatch,not_removed,cool thanks
Overwatch,not_removed,didnt know that thank you
Overwatch,not_removed,really helpful my only question is when you say zaryas charge thats the orb that shows if you have bonus damage right not ammo charge
Overwatch,not_removed,thats very helpful thanks
Overwatch,not_removed,i like a good high pharah attack from the side you can blow the rein away from the bastion and your rockets have enough power to kill both if your luckyskilled
Overwatch,not_removed,also dvas defense matrix can destroy ultimates from heroes such as hanzo zaria and mei
Overwatch,not_removed,if i recall right bastion with his armor is another exception
Overwatch,not_removed,awesome thank you i think my issue is ive been staying too far back need to get in some faces like with zarya will report back
Overwatch,not_removed,winston is probably a bit more mobile than dva
Overwatch,not_removed,also graviton surge which deals like damage anyways but still
Overwatch,not_removed,thanks
Overwatch,not_removed,generally tracer destroys winston the monkey needs to be really good to handle a good tracer
Overwatch,not_removed,that is exactly what i was asking thank you very much
Overwatch,not_removed,i do this a lot and one tip i have for practicing with mcree is to set cooldowns to and just use combat roll instead of reloading it makes keeping the bots in your los easier and you worry less about ammo and can focus more on aiming
Overwatch,not_removed,well ive been doing that for a bit the ana bots thing weapon accuracy is still shit and i cant even hit ones that are standing still most of the time besides are bots good practice i mean they dont move as erratically as players do and im just walking around most of my shooting is gonna be going on in a crazy firefight where ill be jumping all over the place and stuff also curious why green crosshair
Overwatch,not_removed,followup question do we still get point for each win
Overwatch,not_removed,funny that i have yet to see it on this subreddit thanks
Overwatch,not_removed,i got flamed for wanting to practice hanzo on attack with a new skin i got it was just annoying well hopefully things get better when new season starts
Overwatch,not_removed,thanks for the reply do i have to be by sept to join in or if i hit sometime during the season can i join in also calling it a season makes it sound like theres more to it then just the unlocking of competitive play
Overwatch,not_removed,i have no idea why that bugged me for weeks but it did her nanoboost isnt a projectile is it
Overwatch,not_removed,thanks i have no idea why that bugged me for so long
Overwatch,not_removed,thank you
Overwatch,not_removed,thanks
Overwatch,not_removed,assumed that would be the case thanks for the reply
Overwatch,not_removed,thanks the dva advice does make sense however widow almost always instantly kills the pharah if she pops out her head so that tricks been tried
Overwatch,not_removed,thanks mate
Overwatch,not_removed,thanks i will immediately give this a try and report back if it works well edit played for a few matches with this there is a noticeable improvement in the server time still somewhat janky at times but a hundred times better even though i still sometimes get a ping with digits the wait for the matchmaking is at some times quite long had a few skirmishes for minutes or so but some matches were also found very quickly all in all not too bad and a massive improvement at least thanks
Overwatch,not_removed,thanks d
Overwatch,not_removed,also pharah junkrat torb unless youre on console but then symmetra goes too and zarya reaper and bastion plus mei and roadhog were affected by selfhealing giving ult but their charge rates have been adjusted for it
Overwatch,not_removed,since the official release you and the guy that replied seem correct but just to add some slightly related info winston was nerfed in beta as well as bastion going through a lot of reworks his ult used to be a land mine and he used to have a shield
Overwatch,not_removed,of course it is probably could have figured that out if id thought about it for longer than a second
Overwatch,not_removed,oh alright thanks for the info hopefully these bored people will stop soon
Overwatch,not_removed,thanks
Overwatch,not_removed,do you know what i should be using i got my computer a month ago and this is my first fps on a computer
Overwatch,not_removed,i dont mind a loss if it was a good game but some games you dont even stand a remote chance in that always frustrates thank you for the reply
Overwatch,not_removed,the battleborn community on xbox is pretty small too its either hard core players or people who leave or afk the games makes it not a great deal of fun cheers for the reply
Overwatch,not_removed,thank you
Overwatch,not_removed,it will affect the initial arrow speed as it has to travel iirc meters before the dragons spawn that brings it down to twitch level reflexes for dva to be able to eat it with her defense matrix
Overwatch,not_removed,regarding point the meta youre heavily implying might not hold in that remains to be seen its still a solid starting point but there are comps out there that can really mess with it even without hero stacking
Overwatch,not_removed,no one had to buy any loot boxes but i do completely understand your point i just played a little extra to get a few more than i normally would i loved it
Overwatch,not_removed,again thats an interrupt interrupts stop ults knock backs dont
Overwatch,not_removed,cheesy defenses like this are cancer in quick play unless youre in a well organized team this is very unlikely in quick play so a lot of matches will be shutdown on the last checkpoint if youre lucky enough to have a good genji of your own that can help break things up if not your only shot is going for tons of explosive damage and a fast rush with as many ults as you can build up first reinhardt is not as good of a choice as zaryadva in this situation because like you observed the shield will be dead in seconds roadhog can also be a good choice but only if you land the first hook and grab someone on the first try the problem of course is getting your team to work together a lot of people will start switching to snipers and genjis out of desperation which can work against a single bastion or turret but then you dont have the power needed to push in afterwards your best bet is a fast explosive deathball with lots of ults you have to overwhelm them a steady reinhardt push will rarely work
Overwatch,not_removed,indeed i mainly use it so i can browse the internetreddit while in queue and click the window if i need to voice chat or something less annoying then alt tabbing all the time anyways im thinking theres a decent chance it could fix whatever is causing this cursorcrosshair bug
Overwatch,not_removed,a good backronym to help remember it is most efficient tactics availible
Overwatch,not_removed,wait holding shift will pop her bubble the second it is availableshe isnt stunned
Overwatch,not_removed,holy shit
Overwatch,not_removed,i think he used to say time to reap or something like that instead of die die die in the closed beta glad they changed it
Overwatch,not_removed,absolutely i believe the story is that hes an omnic film director maybe halfred glitchbot from the movie posters who needs protection on his way to the set and hes definitely sassy isnt he
Overwatch,not_removed,speaking as that tank sometimes dont do that it just makes us glow and more of a target
Overwatch,not_removed,stops me getting flamed any lower and teammates might want you to change
Overwatch,not_removed,i personally prefer the standard circle for dva as it gives me a better idea of the range of the spread
Overwatch,not_removed,if it worked like batmans grapple in the arkham games it would be perfect just an indicator of where youre about to go maybe while youre holding the button down
Overwatch,not_removed,yup melee dps is half that of tesla cannon but all that dps is frontloaded into the first instant followed by the cooldown for maximum kill speed use tesla exclusively until they reach health then melee this will save you a little under half a second of damageammo of course this is risky because you could miss melee too early and are only able to hit one enemy so it should really only be used when that half a second is going to matter
Overwatch,not_removed,implying bastion isnt a tank
Overwatch,not_removed,right i forgot about bastion he would survive with hp
Overwatch,not_removed,yeah dva simply isnt as effective from far back because of the damage drop off i like playing her when im feeling more aggressive haha
Overwatch,not_removed,as winston i have wrecked most tracers i come across you just need to point in their general direction and in seconds she will be dead add less than if she recalls as tracer you are dealing small amounts of damage before you break through the armor each shot is halved by reducing up to damage meaning her max dmg per shot is not on a body hit and on a critical then he has bubble that can negate dmg for seconds as he keeps shooting you not to mention he can easily disengage or chase tracer with his leap and deal damage if she is within meters of impact if you are going to add in her ult then yeah she can kill him but at the same time he could ult at hp and then have
Overwatch,not_removed,try just standing perfectly still and getting headshots for a while anas a little misleading because i think the top of her hood doesnt have a hitbox she also has a pretty small head after that try to make the practice hard for yourself engage the anas in different spots ranges and elevations try to headshot while strafing right after rolling while jumping etc they dont move as erratically as players but its a closeenough approximation maybe not for a genji but getting fast at recentering on the next ana will help you track him the green dot thing is just something i read once i like the dot because its very clear about where your shot is going if its not under the dot its not getting shot that source recommended the neon green color because it stands out against every background in the game this was before the new map so well see if that makes a difference
Overwatch,not_removed,no you get points per win and per draw hope this helps
Overwatch,not_removed,you can play it as soon as you reach level so long as its not during the off season people recommend not playing competitive until later than level though so you have a good handle on heroesmapsetc the seasons are basically just that once you start a new season you will have to reearn your rank starting with placement matches i havent done competitive so if theres more to it im not really the best person to answer questions about comp play though haha
Overwatch,not_removed,actually i think it is you should get two friends and test it out i have no friends
Overwatch,not_removed,no problemo boss hope i answered your question sufficiently
Overwatch,not_removed,you need to either get the widow to move or distracted enough that they cant snipe pharah junkrat with his indirect fire may be what you need
Overwatch,not_removed,a zarya barrer does wonders but hitting the cunc doesnt have to be precise just get the rein away from the bastion its even easier if theyre on a high ground peeking time is usually enough
Overwatch,not_removed,there are some latency issues recently maybe related to the ddos because of the new wow release hopefully you find the au server smoother in a few days i use it and consistently get ping and very little packet loss but tonight around the time of your comment some of my friends were complaining of unusual ping spikes earlier id seen mass disconnects and some official tweets theres definitely matchmaking prime time depending on your level hidden skill ranking party size etc my usual queue time in quick play as a level is about a minute but can rise rapidly if im queuing with others enjoy your stay here
Overwatch,not_removed,that would pretty much mean that they would be high level but level doenst matter for a pro player
Overwatch,not_removed,pharah yes true junkrat has some changes to his trap iirc torb also had a turret build change zayra erm yep cant think of anything for her
Overwatch,not_removed,i play dpi and sens in game do whatever you like but check out something similar to that if you wanna weigh your options
Overwatch,not_removed,in overwatch youll experience games of all types youll get stomped on youll do the stomping youll win close matches youll lose close matches the matchmaking system is pretty good so your experiences will balance each other out over time
Overwatch,not_removed,
Overwatch,not_removed,i think im just spoiled by dota where chests remove the item from the random sorting until you get all the common items
Overwatch,not_removed,yup and as far as ive seen holding any ability button negates pinglag and action is executed by server as fast as it can be
Overwatch,not_removed,i might as well have had wheels on this thing
Overwatch,not_removed,he is listed as defense hero and i thought he was refering to the official overwatch categories
Overwatch,not_removed,per draw
Overwatch,not_removed,yeah i didnt do my placement matches until like level but thats just a personal preference they also changed the rank system for season so the placement matches could help you get a handle on it being scored out of and not like before
Overwatch,not_removed,thats okay buddy i dont even have the game i just play whenever im at a friends place who has it
Overwatch,not_removed,junks trap change was a bugfix more than anything although it made it click more often so technically made him better whats torbs change been
Overwatch,not_removed,i cant recall off the top of my head but i know there was a change to the build it may well have just been another fix rather then a balance change
Overwatch,not_removed,the last change to torb i can recall was during closed beta not after release i might be wrong though
Overwatch,not_removed,level isnt rank if you are being matched with level that mean they are in your mmr bracket
Overwatch,not_removed,the system is supposed to try to balance it with lowerranked people on the enemy team when a party on your side brings in a lowbie is it not
Overwatch,not_removed,they can be carried in by higher ranked people like op said more likely theyre grouped with someone i think hes just asking why there are no limits to the distance between highest and lowest
Overwatch,not_removed,that was intense
Overwatch,not_removed,i feel motion sick
Overwatch,not_removed,wow not sure who did worse here d
Overwatch,not_removed,i feel your pain got a team kill assists with zens discord orb and this mercy who only resurrected of her teammates got potg
Overwatch,not_removed,eg zarya ult but she only did of the dmg on a quadra but tracer dealt the on your ult tracer get it you see those fire point when you kill someone it represent how much dmg you dealt on him eliminated player fire point
Overwatch,not_removed,low sens works well for shooters use whatever you feel like you perform best with its hard to go too low as long as you can still do a turn comfortable
Overwatch,not_removed,every setting is fine if you hit your shots i suggest you go to the training map and trace some targets and see if you can properly follow their speed from close and long range without losing control or feeling strain on your wrist also test flick shots from all ranges to get yourself adjusted to unexpected target locations nobody but you can find the sens that will work best for you it could be dpi at sense or dpi at sense all depends on the person
Overwatch,not_removed,i use dpi at sens sens was barely too high and was way too low took some getting used to but its perfect for me same sens i used in csgo and still works great its slightly higher than average but some csgo pros use it and i love it especially in overwatch where certain heroes move really fast i like the tiny extra bit
Overwatch,not_removed,mine is in game with dpi this means i can do a in a little less than the pro player seagull who is one of the most well known players plays on and im not ashamed to admit i used his settings as a starting point p i think the idea is you want to be able to use your wrist for aiming and your arm for turning i think id find yours a bit too slow you can only move your wristarm so fast and in a lot of scenarios i find myself needing to turn around quickly i guess it depends son your hero choice and playstyle too its not extreme so of it works stick with it but whatever you decide on just stay there if youre constantly adjusting you wont ever develop muscle memory
Overwatch,not_removed,just started trying out dpi at sens so far i like the added sensitivity above pro level because like you said i think this game moves faster than csgo and a bit
Overwatch,not_removed,its barely any added sensthe equivalent of what some cs pros use would be ingame for overwatch is just a pinch up but i like it
Overwatch,not_removed,how about you contest the point while you know doing something other than sitting around maybe even help your team a little bit and get some kills while youre at it
Overwatch,not_removed,should have been more clear i am mostly talking about some situations when the whole team gets killed and i manage to be a lone survivor then i proceed to hide in a spot where people do not usually check and i am able to buy time by contesting the point stalling is crucial
Overwatch,not_removed,arent you lucky
Overwatch,not_removed,hi lucky i am griffonictobias
Overwatch,not_removed,i would try discord but i dont have the link sorry
Overwatch,not_removed,yea check the sidebar to the right the discord chat has a tooooonnnnnn of players that are lfg today i checked and i think it had ten thousand members youll find a group for sure just make sure youre willing to leave the group and look for another one if the first team turns out to be shitters ive had several yes from there that only wanted to play gimmick teams or that kept trying to troll teammates
Overwatch,not_removed,im going to use that discord on saturday so far im at wins to losses since tuesday
Overwatch,not_removed,i agree
Overwatch,not_removed,spoke to soon lol just googled it
Overwatch,not_removed,my problem with the whole thing is i got a warning for leaving early because i ran into a few troll teams all going a single hero or my favorite torbys bastions and symetras on defense on route fuck those guys i didnt actually get the penalty but that notice was just irritating to have on the screen
Overwatch,not_removed,sounds like offensive hanzos time to shine
Overwatch,not_removed,or junkrat i love arcing a frag right into bastions face or even better out sniping a widowmaker with junkrat
Overwatch,not_removed,kinda wish i could have seen any of the setup
Overwatch,not_removed,you should check overbuff they have medal stats there
Overwatch,not_removed,yeah its really helpful because it keeps track of your most recent games sessions too and also games per hero
Overwatch,not_removed,if ana sleepdarts an ulting pharah you get a funny similar exchange justice rains from ab dart i think justice could use a little nap
Overwatch,not_removed,hes like a mini reaper with armor packs whats not to love
Overwatch,not_removed,his gun does a surprising amount of damage
Overwatch,not_removed,he is the ultimate counter to tanks and flankers you can breeze the last push on attack with molten core blazing on the payload he is strong and so freaking fun to play with
Overwatch,not_removed,when youre in silver and people dont know how to use him well enough to be viable tbh
Overwatch,not_removed,okay that makes a lot more sense now
Overwatch,not_removed,hes actually better than mccree on attack because he has no damage dropoff on his primary fire left click torb primary damage no drop off mccree primary damage from falling down to damage at roadhogs hook is its not unrealistic for a ranged damage dealer to be sitting much further back so as to not get hooked and because all the tanks are at that front line
Overwatch,not_removed,axiom ram is good ram
Overwatch,not_removed,on call of duty i always had the jumpjet pack set to worked pretty well after a while
Overwatch,not_removed,i cant imagine this being possible on console its even a little difficult on pc
Overwatch,not_removed,i use a scuf for xbox one makes it very easy
Overwatch,not_removed,try it works perfectly fine for me i mapped every heros jump to works wonders for pharah im able to bunny hop around the pole in lijiang tower
Overwatch,not_removed,youve got all of them that have been announced so far i expect them to reveal more plans for all the characters if this first batch goes smoothly i for one dont even collect pops and im gonna try to snag all of these
Overwatch,not_removed,who can bench the most
Overwatch,not_removed,ive tried this on custom with cool down on abilities the longest game of all time
Overwatch,not_removed,looks like the new godzilla movie
Overwatch,not_removed,well a zarya benches more than the next zarya who benches more than the other zaryas who wait a minute
Overwatch,not_removed,played like this for good solid minutes without anyone dying at all
Overwatch,not_removed,too much reading not enough funny
Overwatch,not_removed,the best part is that people are actually like this
Overwatch,not_removed,can confirm a friend of mine is like this
Overwatch,not_removed,if you are not in los of your teammates you are positioned badly or your team is and you may need to switch to a different healer she regens health after not taking damage for one second her weapon is perfectly fine to get her out of a bind or do some extra damage when needed
Overwatch,not_removed,welcome always stay at he backand always in the middle of teammates mind your positioning also remember that you can press the fly key a second time to cancel the flight and you can also turn midflight aim for a different person and fly to them all the while healing or boosting the first and then second persons of course her pistol is best used in selfdefense like when a reaper is chasing you half the time you can actually survive additionally if you prefer a more restohotstranquility play style and more survivability as a support play lucio
Overwatch,not_removed,she has selfheal it automatically happens after not taking damage for second she has the second highest healpersecond is able to buff damage and requires no aim for her healing unlike ana her ultimate is the most powerful in the game in exchange shes highly dependent on her team her weapon is borderline useless i wont meme you but someone else will in a moment im sure
Overwatch,not_removed,mercy is almost always a pick on competitive defense the pros are great with her
Overwatch,not_removed,mercy has a very strong ult and passive self healing she was already buffed a little while ago imo master she is okay it really depends on your teammates though you always have to stay kinda behind everything and your team has to show in certain shituations so you can shift to them its also important that your teammates do alot to protect you and especially on low level this is probably the problem
Overwatch,not_removed,maybe its just a lack of experience but mercy is fine her pistol is supposed to be weak and it can still get a a few kills if you know how to use it probably she should always be in los with a teammate and she does have a lot of self healing actually she heals herself pretty damn well
Overwatch,not_removed,her weapon is borderline useless no it is not it deals a surprising amount of damage and she does have a massive selfheal it kicks in when you dont get damage for second its passive
Overwatch,not_removed,i think on defense mercy ult is greatest but on attack i dont think it compares with lucio
Overwatch,not_removed,which tourneys have you been watching then
Overwatch,not_removed,as a tip you can change the settings for her guardian angel to not be on toggle so you have to hold the button the entire time you are flying to a teammate it makes it easier to stop flying to a teammate if you are in danger as someone else said shes very reliant on her team moreso than the other healers so shes more difficult to play without coordination
Overwatch,not_removed,her wep is not terrible or absolutely terrible fact is you just got the game and instead of accepting you are new and you need to learn you vent on reddit to be balance expert just learn enjoy and keep in mind you are new and welcome to ow
Overwatch,not_removed,her character inspires a surprising amount of maymays
Overwatch,not_removed,it also helps to have her beam connection on toggle and guardian angel prefer beam target off hope that helps a bit
Overwatch,not_removed,httpsgfycatcomcriminalblushingivorybackedwoodswallow
Overwatch,not_removed,its still too fast in slow mo you can barley see the melee
Overwatch,not_removed,you can still kinda pull off the combo if you right click dash towards the floor melee afterwards but it wont be as quick as before
Overwatch,not_removed,and the only time it really made a difference you do not see this shit vs any other hero really
Overwatch,not_removed,dont even need the combo on that one you got at least one headshot and all three landed so tracer was screwed anyway
Overwatch,not_removed,do you mean you do not see this shit nerf to be done for any other hero or you do not see any other hero doing this shit
Overwatch,not_removed,ik but it looks cooler with the dash so yeah
Overwatch,not_removed,you do not see the full combo in a match vs any hero other than tracer usually
Overwatch,not_removed,really i see it used all the time against anyone lol as long as you can get in range to do it tracer is just the only hero that gets one shot by it
Overwatch,not_removed,i like creepin up on widows and doing it when its not even necessary
Overwatch,not_removed,yeah tracer is the only hero that gets one shot but still the combo is always used first
Overwatch,not_removed,as long as you can get in range to do it theres your problem not to mention managing health values so your dash actually resets
Overwatch,not_removed,true creep mode is crouchwalk approach them and then get in front of them pop up with deflect going gotta get the full disrespect kill
Overwatch,not_removed,now i think this is like saying roadhog combo is good as long as you hit the hook
Overwatch,not_removed,hitting hooks happens a lot more than a genji in melee range without burning dash
Overwatch,not_removed,message me ill get back to you when i get home
Overwatch,not_removed,httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvgpmohlksoyg
Overwatch,not_removed,bruh its because people get triggered when their potg gets stolen by a bastion my friend had the exact issue until he started maining genji and got a ton of respect
Overwatch,not_removed,im not sure how to feel about a bastion with a golden gun its somewhere between terrified and awe other than that i enjoy every potg that doesnt include bastions leftclick and a terrible enemy team or just pressing q for that matter
Overwatch,not_removed,surprisingly good tracking for playing on console good job and the golden bastion gun scares me

Overwatch,not_removed,i want this so much
Overwatch,not_removed,found your article about this
Overwatch,not_removed,naruto skin wen
Overwatch,not_removed,i have never seen such a better idea ive wanted implemented in overwatch
Overwatch,not_removed,fantastic
Overwatch,not_removed,i love mad worldxd
Overwatch,not_removed,sounds very nice
Overwatch,not_removed,nope theyll automatically update your ptr account whenever they feel like it
Overwatch,not_removed,thats a shame thank you for clarifying
Overwatch,not_removed,my reinhardt is much better than yours my reinhardt can walk right through the door
Overwatch,not_removed,nice roll it is always a bitch when you get stuck with a tracer split though
Overwatch,not_removed,nice username
Overwatch,not_removed,ana is really only usable if she is a second support pick right now she does way higher hps than anybody else in the game from as long range as she thinks she can get away with and then she goes and doubles even that with her grenade when ana is paired with another nonlucio healer its them thats the second healer not ana
Overwatch,not_removed,however that would give away part of the teams composition and there are counters to the snipers other than another sniper winston reaper tracer etc you dont need a sniper to deal with another sniper
Overwatch,not_removed,too many snipers should appear with zero snipers on the team
Overwatch,not_removed,theyre a great counter for turrets
Overwatch,not_removed,you can see the enemys composition at any time during the game anyway flankers are great at taking out snipers but you have to get close ive found that snipers are a great counter to themselves and a good one will destroy your support and the rest of your team if you dont have a quick way if dealing with them
Overwatch,not_removed,but not before the match their team appears as a question mark and the only way to determine who is who is to eyeball it heroes like winston may not be flankers but he is unrelenting and can chase most snipers down and kill them eventually furthermore reaper can just teleport right behind the sniper and unload rounds into them at point blank wiping the sniper out before they know whats going on
Overwatch,not_removed,i want a mod that makes lucios ult turn into the final countdown or something ba like that
Overwatch,not_removed,i think someone made a mod that turned most of reapers voicelines into seinfeld quotes
Overwatch,not_removed,probably gonna get banned lol
Overwatch,not_removed,overwatch doesnt have modding support
Overwatch,not_removed,i dont know if their ban bot would detect something like an audio file change but im not a programmer so dont quote me on that
Overwatch,not_removed,oh now that makes sense server crashed for me
Overwatch,not_removed,your submission has been deleted the reasons being your submission was already submitted in a very similar fashion and therefore counts as a duplicate if you have any questions please state them in an answer to this post for concerns or to contact the whole staff please with the removal of my submissionmessageim writing to you about the following submission issue is for more information please consult httpswwwredditcomroverwatchwikirules
Overwatch,not_removed,its not about medals its about how good you did vs preset standard blizzard made per hero
Overwatch,not_removed,the more goldsilver medals you get is not a factor ive played over ranked games so far and have noticed no difference from getting a gold vs silver vs bronze
Overwatch,not_removed,that isnt true in the slightest bc you do gainlose rank based on performance so how would low rated players meet pre set standards
Overwatch,not_removed,not sure what game you are playing but this is true there are games where i do shitty and get like of a bar and games where i get gold medals and jump a whole rank bar so this is true unless blizzard denys it i am sure this is intended
Overwatch,not_removed,i just played a game where i got gold medals and silver httpimgurcomwukxgoa if medals effect it its not happening for me maybe we are playing different games
Overwatch,not_removed,i didnt think id have to talk directly to you but i made an edit for you in any elo system if you beat someone you should beat you wont gain a great amount same vice versa medals are not the only factor im just bringing up the mitigating argument they hold
Overwatch,not_removed,i know and what im saying is that i havent noticed any amount of difference in winning and losing via medals i havent seen any evidence that medals effect elo rating
Overwatch,not_removed,gamebreaking its just lost exp you even left the match like you lost ranking by no reason or something it s just some useless xp
Overwatch,not_removed,gamebreaking because i was about to get a loot box
Overwatch,not_removed,the time you wrote this post you could ve won that xp in quick play d
Overwatch,not_removed,thats what i do i dont play what i normally want to play instead being the team tank or support because nobody bothers to pick up the hammer or staff doesnt matter if im sick of playing mercy for the past games or really wanting to try that zarya strat i prioritize the team above my own preferences
Overwatch,not_removed,i think there should be some compromise its still a young game people need to practice somehow once the competitive mode rolls around quick play should be a little more relaxed with this stuff
Overwatch,not_removed,i always end up in a team with mccree or reapers luckily my team has always had a tank and support
Overwatch,not_removed,i think most of the people who frequent this reddit know this kind of thing already since its one of the most complained about issues ive seen i recommend telling this to the players in game if you get a chance and explaining why or when and how to flankstay with the group if even one person listens and becomes a better player youve done a great thing here we know this already
Overwatch,not_removed,i would say having lone wolf acting as a good flanker while the rest contest the battle lines could tip the game
Overwatch,not_removed,play with friends i recommend also game is new people are learning also sometimes people like me get fed up of always playing tanksupport and then play whatever i want dont really care if i loose at that moment also i have played so much tank and support i have realized i suck horribly with most assault classes except soldier and am completely useless with widowhanzo so unless i pull shit like this i will never get better and will eventually get pigeonholed into tank or support only
Overwatch,not_removed,youre obviously terrible at the game since youre getting matched with complete potatoes on your team matchmaking is absolutely perfect and your matchmaking rating is completely accurate of the people on this site me unless you play with friends of your time in the game mmr is completely inaccurate especially if youre a solo player you could be the best player in the world but if your teammates are trash youre gonna do poorly and itll continue putting you with trash teammates the solution is to just never play without a full party or else youll just end up playing against full parties with lone wolves on your team who pick three widowmakers and your mmr will decrease sticking you with even worse teammates ive found that i get the most enjoyment out of the game when i simply dont play it unless of my friends are gonna play it as well i mean for most games the fun increases when you play with friends but for this game its literally no fun whatsoever unless you play it with friends
Overwatch,not_removed,yeah once ranked comes out quick play should be open for people to try different characters that dont necessarily complement the team composition well people have to be able to cut their teeth with new characters at some point not everyone will instantly be good with all characters
Overwatch,not_removed,two mccrees can be strong with a reinhard honestly generally though that isnt what they are doing i get it
Overwatch,not_removed,playing with friends shouldnt have to be the answer to avoid blatant idiocy and lack of trying also not always possible to do so lives and such
Overwatch,not_removed,its not ranked doesnt really work since well people will do it in ranked as well lol look at league and beta
Overwatch,not_removed,well thats all you i guess i only play solo and have ton of fun i tried to get in group but its just the same unless its your friends and just wait a little bit for the match making have enough data to get you better match
Overwatch,not_removed,what are you actually trying to say here i cant figure it out from the post
Overwatch,not_removed,use hanzomercy to shot tanks
Overwatch,not_removed,i like playing tanks rein especially protecting your team is important
Overwatch,not_removed,i think their point is that being nothing but a bullet sponge which is what a conventional lowdps tank would look like in a shooter is kind of a terrible job in mmos tanking is fun because you have as much variety of abilities as the dps if not more and youre totally vital in ow youd have three buttons max unless you just had two shields and no weapon at all and your life would be standing in a series of choke points and hoping someone nearby could actually make kills in response to that point though the reason tanks need a nerf is because right now theres little reason to bring more than one dps hero tanks have enough damage output to win a lot of matchups and no major drawbacks besides none of them having much range except zaryas grenades but those arent gonna win you a firefight on defense the range thing doesnt matter too much because you want to focus on chokepoints and entrances anyway while on offense it doesnt matter much because well the enemy team is three tanks and two healers so what are they gonna do to you at long range
Overwatch,not_removed,not even widow mercy can one shot tanks hanzo mercy isnt going to
Overwatch,not_removed,would a damage nerf be enough to fix this or is it based in the issues with other heroes as well
Overwatch,not_removed,what are you even on about scatter does without mercyzen not to mention point blank dragon ult doesnt need a damage boost
Overwatch,not_removed,i was under the impression you were talking about the normal arrow
Overwatch,not_removed,
Overwatch,not_removed,its a talon agent was the first number to pop into my head not everything is about you jack referring to your picture p
Overwatch,not_removed,httpiimgurcomdwvlagifnoredirect
Overwatch,not_removed,ish hours on lucio ish hours on zenyatta ish hours on mercy if i wasnt running the game on a literal toaster then my lucio hours would likely be closer to and my mercy hours would be down to turns out running the game at negative frames is really bad when you have to be able to aim your wall rides id probably have some real hours in there as ana if i ran at a smooth too so until taxmus season zenyatta all the way i love his ability to dish out damage and just shred through tanks while also keeping the team topped off if i had a real big boy pc id mention that one of my favorite games growing up was jet set radio and lucio allows me to relive that beautiful time while being a credit to the team by just existing
Overwatch,not_removed,dva hours reinhardt junkrat i play a decent ana as well but i used dva before she was cool
Overwatch,not_removed,dvas been my main since i started playing overwatch but i generally fill in what the team needs so i play a lot of heroes
Overwatch,not_removed,mains are currently hog and zen but im newish lvl and experimenting more with tracer widow and junkrat now
Overwatch,not_removed,zenyatta roadhog mei and lucio
Overwatch,not_removed,ana freelo
Overwatch,not_removed,mei definitely
Overwatch,not_removed,i dont fully main anyone but i have most hours in mercy mercy main btw
Overwatch,not_removed,i main mccree i enjoy widow but shes a qp only choice of the time as i lack kephrii god skills
Overwatch,not_removed,i dont really main anyone
Overwatch,not_removed,i am one of the rarest people in ow i main symmetra before she was reworked
Overwatch,not_removed,no one
Overwatch,not_removed,lucio and hog lucio cause he just has to exist to help the team hog cause of the op hook xd
Overwatch,not_removed,upvotes for jet set radio future one of the reasons i play lucio also if only he could do tricks lol i main zarya mostly because she is op but i play what the team comp needs soldier reaper because they will forever be in the meta roadhog because he crushes squishies and tanks zenyatta because discords for the team and hes an insane damage dealer and healer lucio because as stated above i love jet set radio future and hes an great healer for tracer genji and other squishies
Overwatch,not_removed,i have to admit me too
Overwatch,not_removed,how come the pin didnt kill him
Overwatch,not_removed,probably reinhardts hammer
Overwatch,not_removed,why the fu are you kiddi no no this is my reality now reinharts are flying just accept it
Overwatch,not_removed,probably something along the lines of when did reinhardt learn how to fly
Overwatch,not_removed,reinhardt rocketjump nbsp sounds dangerous
Overwatch,not_removed,as mercy this kind of stuff happens to me all the time when i watch the kill cam most of the time the rein was charging at someone else and here i come out of nowhere to be smushed last second i always exclaim lucky rein piece of
Overwatch,not_removed,reinhardts hammer obviously
Overwatch,not_removed,reinhart pinned me in dorado while i was standing behind a flower pot wtf
Overwatch,not_removed,reinhardts hammer was going through his mind
Overwatch,not_removed,wondering that too hence my wild swiping afterwards like shouldnt you be dead
Overwatch,not_removed,i am also confused by this out of range for the sound barrier so that didnt save him
Overwatch,not_removed,you can clearly see the sound barrier on him
Overwatch,not_removed,shield or maybe an air pin does less
Overwatch,not_removed,it has happened to me too its a delayed reaction death i pinned an enemy mccree and lucio bomped me sideways into a pillar the one on illios well map i thought he saved mccree so i put up my shield ready for the flash bang he lmb my shield once then fell down dead entirely by me it showed up in my potg so i have it saved ill share it when i get home edit the lucio did not use his sound barrier when it happened to me so i know its not because of the barrier
Overwatch,not_removed,came here specifically looking for this
Overwatch,not_removed,it was the lucio ult a pin does damage no matter what so long as you hit a surface
Overwatch,not_removed,it has happened to me too its a delayed reaction death i pinned an enemy mccree and lucio bomped me sideways into a pillar the one on illios well map i thought he saved mccree so i put up my shield ready for the flash bang he lmb my shield once then fell down dead entirely by me it showed up in my potg so i have it saved ill share it when i get home edit the lucio did not use his sound barrier when it happened to me so i know its not because of the barrier
Overwatch,not_removed,he was probably in mid air when the sound barrier came out so he did receive the shields im certain it was the sound barrier
Overwatch,not_removed,it has happened to me too its a delayed reaction death i pinned an enemy mccree and lucio bomped me sideways into a pillar the one on illios well map i thought he saved mccree so i put up my shield ready for the flash bang he lmb my shield once then fell down dead entirely by me it showed up in my potg so i have it saved ill share it when i get home edit the lucio did not use his sound barrier when it happened to me so i know its not because of the barrier
Overwatch,not_removed,heres a tip for all meis placing walls on adjacent ground can be difficult because of the lack of slope try jumping as youre about the place a wall so that you can be a bit more precise with where you want to place your wall dont accidentally do this in your season games
Overwatch,not_removed,but not mccree fuck that guy
Overwatch,not_removed,dva dva bad guys mccree go fuck yourself
Overwatch,not_removed,dva recognised the bullet speed and walked perfectly to make the railing take the bullet outplayed idiot s
Overwatch,not_removed,reasons why mccrees ult in the current form simply sucks
Overwatch,not_removed,someday blizzard will make his ultimate more viable but for now its pretty much just a death sentence imagine if pharah had to scream justice rains from above and then have the immobilization start for or seconds before she gets to shoot people and thats just about the amount of death you receive ever ytime as mccree
Overwatch,not_removed,feelsbadman
Overwatch,not_removed,rmccreemains
Overwatch,not_removed,for mccree being hitscan his shot was really delayed there
Overwatch,not_removed,heh red team motherfucker they can escape your high noon behind a blade of grass
Overwatch,not_removed,blizzard fuck mcree
Overwatch,not_removed,deadeye needs a revamp
Overwatch,not_removed,t o o c l o s e o o c l o s e
Overwatch,not_removed,mccree is projectile confirmed no wonder the pharah never dies to my teams cree
Overwatch,not_removed,but that flick though
Overwatch,not_removed,i thought mccrees gun was hitscan which is a term i learned recently so i dont really know
Overwatch,not_removed,as a mccree main i can relate to this post
Overwatch,not_removed,calculated
Overwatch,not_removed,did the stairs block the shot i cant really tell
Overwatch,not_removed,i know that feeling and man does it suck
Overwatch,not_removed,somebody ring the dinkster
Overwatch,not_removed,
Overwatch,not_removed,mccree really does need some work done on him i dont think hes even been touched since the game came out last year
Overwatch,not_removed,
Overwatch,not_removed,rhitboxporn
Overwatch,not_removed,
Overwatch,not_removed,this just makes me have even more second thoughts about mccree serious inquiry im just now kinda wanting to learn mccree but its now becoming more apparent that he needs a rework damage falloff mobility issues and even his ult makes him unfairly easy to deal with he isnt utilized properly in low ranks and easily countered in high ranks hes not a mustpick anymore like he used to be not that thats a bad thing it just shows how far hes fallen from grace should i still push through because i can only devote so much time to learning a few core heroes and my soldiertracer needs more work basically im asking if hes worth the time to learn compared to other dps
Overwatch,not_removed,did somebody ring the dinkster
Overwatch,not_removed,that would tilt me so much
Overwatch,not_removed,wasnt locked anyway was it
Overwatch,not_removed,the story of my life
Overwatch,not_removed,heroes never die
Overwatch,not_removed,its already been proven he can shoot more than people though
Overwatch,not_removed,same happened to me as widow in gibraltar damn nm pole on that bridge
Overwatch,not_removed,calculated
Overwatch,not_removed,needs more nerf
Overwatch,not_removed,mcree needs a buff i think reducing cooldown of his roll would be good
Overwatch,not_removed,mccree looks like he has a tweeky in the thumbnail
Overwatch,not_removed,somebody ring the dinkster
Overwatch,not_removed,did somebody ring the dinkster
Overwatch,not_removed,please tell me that when you get potg you type out some body ring the dinkster
Overwatch,not_removed,as someone who loses his shit regularly this would definitely prompt some angry keyboard clacking
Overwatch,not_removed,focus mark draw mccree takes a few precious moments to aim when hes ready to fire he shoots every enemy in his line of sight the bullet fired by deadeye will always hit a highlighted enemy so long as they are within mccrees vision when he presses the primary fire button they should really update these
Overwatch,not_removed,can somebody explain to me how he got a kill shot on genji without being moused over him and how he magically snapped perfectly to genji in the span of frames of this gif in order to get said shot
Overwatch,not_removed,
Overwatch,not_removed,yeah if his es on cd would he fuck with me
Overwatch,not_removed,mccree f that guy
Overwatch,not_removed,if your es on cd would you fuck with me
Overwatch,not_removed,get fukt idiot the almighty words of firebat
Overwatch,not_removed,it should also target torbs turret not really sure why it doesnt
Overwatch,not_removed,how would you go about improving it
Overwatch,not_removed,agree with this made a very similar comment to someone in another thread a little while back i have gotten to the point where i only use mccrees ult on no more than a v situation and typically when its a pharrah flying around that cant get to cover fast enough otherwise you get no benefit from it and you just die going for a or shot kill probably has a success rate of in and forget about a man its more like in
Overwatch,not_removed,you dont have to wait full seconds for lock on you can wait seconds wiping out all squishies and dealing heavy damage to everyone else it accumulates around damage per target per second dealing damage in a single second count me in
Overwatch,not_removed,feelsmadman
Overwatch,not_removed,its because there is a delay between clicking to shoot and shooting its fucking bs btw
Overwatch,not_removed,it is a hitscan while ulting hammering the fan or normal shooting but mccree shoots enemies in an order with some delay inbetween hammers the fan but accurately while using the ultimate and aims at i believe center of the target not head at the time mccree shot at dva dva got behind that pole and the shot got blocked
Overwatch,not_removed,if you manage to duck behind cover while a bullet is midair it wont connect dva hid behind the wall on the upper balcony on dorodo that area is the one behind the church after the first checkpoint there are stairs there to get to the upper balcony and is also where attacking team spawns after getting past the second checkpoint edit corrected
Overwatch,not_removed,please leave a message help the thread grow til the point the developers cannot ignore it
Overwatch,not_removed,mccree was probably the hero they touched the most to balance him during beta his left click got nerfed after the game went live they nerfed fan the hammer then buffed his left click and fan the hammer and they nerfed his ult
Overwatch,not_removed,if you can click faces hes still pretty damn powerful despite the fact his kit sucks if you cant click faces you are probably better off sticking to soldier for now you have no movement ability no self sustain your flashbang is inconsistent your ult sucks but goddamn that left click is good if you are hitting crits i have a winrate with him in qp a winrate with him in comp currently plat so its not like you cant make him work but it definitely feels like you are having to put in the effort to have the same impact as soldier
Overwatch,not_removed,it was at the very start of the gif you can see its a red skull it just immediately turns into a white circle because she moves behind cover as he fires
Overwatch,not_removed,its a flick shot some people including myself find it easier to hit things i dont know why but i have better aim when i snap my shots as opposed to a more subdued type of movement
Overwatch,not_removed,highlightskillcams in overwatch dont have the same recording framerate as the rest of the game and that make it wobbly as well as not being recorded first person
Overwatch,not_removed,i didnt intend on watching that all the way through againand then the video ended d
Overwatch,not_removed,little bitch probably not
Overwatch,not_removed,his fukin trash combo deck
Overwatch,not_removed,i dont remember firebats saying that but its been like years since i played that game
Overwatch,not_removed,silly dizzle the turret has no face hows he supposed to get it right between the eyes
Overwatch,not_removed,because then he could shoot bullets out of a revolver edit im not saying that its impossible just that mccrees fantasy is based around his shot revolver
Overwatch,not_removed,junkrats ult too
Overwatch,not_removed,his gun can hold bullets and the enemy team has players its supposed to be able to kill everyone if given the chance a turret would mean he cant kill of them although i agree a cree ult will never kill everyone so they should make it able to kill the stupid turret
Overwatch,not_removed,because his ultimate targets players
Overwatch,not_removed,only bullets in mccrees gun enemy players if it targeted deployables itd make his ult even weaker
Overwatch,not_removed,either speed up the lock on a bit not much just enough to catch people off guard or let mccree move a little faster when it activates
Overwatch,not_removed,base the lock on time based on proximity makes sense since closer targets are easier to hit and remove the second delay when you fire when you press to shoot it still takes and extra second for mccree to fire
Overwatch,not_removed,just make it shoot all the bullets immediately its idiotic theres a wait time to fire
Overwatch,not_removed,theres a pretty sizable delay in between your click and when the bullets actually begin firing this needs to go
Overwatch,not_removed,base lock on time on amount of health remaining not total health so you could execute people quicker also increase the firing speed so that theres less chance of shenanigans like this happening after you pull the trigger
Overwatch,not_removed,how many ults regularly give you sixman kills though i think even four is a lot for anyone besides well positioned reaper hanzo with wombocombo or maybe soldier with nanoboost
Overwatch,not_removed,has a success rate of in and forget about a man its more like in and here i thought i just sucked with it
Overwatch,not_removed,per target per second actually according to the httpoverwatchgamepediacommccreedeadeye
Overwatch,not_removed,second is half of a squishie seconds is half the cast of characters in the game and thats not even accounting for lag and reaction time
Overwatch,not_removed,id maybe be okay with as long as he is unable to gain charge while hes rolling so its a tradeoff no hed then be able to fire and kill people before anyone could react which defeats the entire purpose of the voice callouts
Overwatch,not_removed,here this should make it better httpsvidmeftwy
Overwatch,not_removed,yeah i hate mccrees ult and that is one of the major reasons i may as well be using anas gun cause the person has walked behind the wall before it actually shoots the gun
Overwatch,not_removed,its not a projectile its hitscan but all the shots dont come out instantly theres a small delay between firing and each shot
Overwatch,not_removed,still doesnt explain the first part
Overwatch,not_removed,i never noticed it before and the shot just looked extra sketchy to me that does make sense though thanks
Overwatch,not_removed,tickrate not frame rate
Overwatch,not_removed,just the biggest pussy in overwatch
Overwatch,not_removed,its from his newest video
Overwatch,not_removed,were the voice clips moddable like in warcraft because i mean maybe you could live the dream
Overwatch,not_removed,just in case you really dont know httpwikiteamliquidnethearthstonefirebat is a hearthstone streamer and the first world champion in the game
Overwatch,not_removed,high noon doesnt hit heads it hits the body
Overwatch,not_removed,if you high noon against opponents in custom he will shoot them all
Overwatch,not_removed,you must not have played the exclusive event during halloween
Overwatch,not_removed,youve never heard of the
Overwatch,not_removed,you clearly never played the halloween event
Overwatch,not_removed,but the ult kills unlimited targets as evidenced by junkensteins revenge the gun doesnt know its out of bullets it only knows it high noon
Overwatch,not_removed,logical consistency would agree with you but this is overwatch so deadeye actually targets all enemies regardless of how many there are ie more than enemies is no problem for mccrees little gun
Overwatch,not_removed,it actually can target and kill more than enemies this was discovered during the junkenstein brawl
Overwatch,not_removed,you dont need to speed up the lockon you just need it to actually start firing the instant you click in its current form there is a window of around seconds inbetween you clicking and the first shot firing meaning times out of they get behind cover
Overwatch,not_removed,let him use his roll while ulting without breaking the ult
Overwatch,not_removed,hes a quick draw but hes not that quick
Overwatch,not_removed,uh no proximity is not involved at all its the amount of health they have that influences lock on time
Overwatch,not_removed,i believe it already locks on with the amount of health remaining
Overwatch,not_removed,thats already how it works itll lock onto a winston faster than a mercy
Overwatch,not_removed,as far as i know lock on happens at the same rate for all characters the difference in time for the kill sign is the difference in health your dmg is increasing at the same speed but youre going to reach pharahs kill shot before a tanks etc
Overwatch,not_removed,second is everyone on the cast with less hp than bastion according to the httpoverwatchgamepediacommccreedeadeye seconds would be damage so no thatd be bad
Overwatch,not_removed,i use it mostly to reload and confuse my opponent in a duel cancel it asap using it even when enemies are trapped in graviton is a death sentence at least peacekeeper is awesome too bad dmg fall off is pretty harsh
Overwatch,not_removed,oh so because high noon shoots from right to left dva had time to run and hide before she died i see for me it looked like the stairs screwed him over but its hard to tell i dont think there was any cover there unless its some cheesy lamp postesque hitbox thing again
Overwatch,not_removed,its a replayhighlight replays are normally not correct in timeframe there might be slight errors here and there
Overwatch,not_removed,it looks like the shot hit the lightpost dva got very lucky with that one wish i could absorb some of that luck
Overwatch,not_removed,if he would cheat he probably wouldnt show it
Overwatch,not_removed,whooooosh
Overwatch,not_removed,also in the junkenstein he stile all the plays because he locked on to everyone
Overwatch,not_removed,dont forget the halloween event killing like bots at once is the most satisfying thing mccree has given to this game so far
Overwatch,not_removed,wait how do you get people in a custom game on one team regardless he shouldnt be able to in a normal game
Overwatch,not_removed,yes probs potg for this mode occurred exclusively at high noon
Overwatch,not_removed,oh i dont know u might be right i just know and at i would expect the gun to stop firing
Overwatch,not_removed,muselk actually did a mythbusters early on that showed it you can finagle all the training bots into one area to all be deadeyed
Overwatch,not_removed,unless youre lucio in which case you die instantly
Overwatch,not_removed,can i move im better when i move
Overwatch,not_removed,this literally blew my mind this will change everything for me
Overwatch,not_removed,lately ive been wondering if a hero with bullet time as an ability would be a good addition or not using it could effect both teams simultaneously it worked for max payne multiplayer but everyone could use it im worried that having only one hero use it would be annoying
Overwatch,not_removed,i know im saying that changing the lock on to a proximity based one could help increase the kps on mccrees ult
Overwatch,not_removed,good to know i was always under the impression that bigger targets took longer to lock on i barely ever play mccree just because his ult is so unreliable
Overwatch,not_removed,its definitely that post but youre basically right i think dva was the third target by the time the shot was fired at her she was just barely behind that post which the shot hit very unlucky
Overwatch,not_removed,didnt know that thanks
Overwatch,not_removed,that is not what im talking about at all can you fucking read
Overwatch,not_removed,except aimbots can be a subtle and not require boxes drawn around literally everything and seeing through walls in a game like ow a simple aimbot is enough
Overwatch,not_removed,you would be surprised how many blatant cheaters have posted things to reddit i remember a widow cheater that stupidly and obviously bound the snap to head button to his crouch button
Overwatch,not_removed,theres a clip of someone highnooning ppl on roverwatch ill try to find it for you later but cmon mccree needs a little love
Overwatch,not_removed,httpsgfycatcomsparklingjubilantaegeancat
Overwatch,not_removed,training room
Overwatch,not_removed,i think you mean high moon
Overwatch,not_removed,its high noon logic ceases to exist at high noon
Overwatch,not_removed,i suspected it might have been discovered before but wasnt sure cheers for the info
Overwatch,not_removed,it was just my wish he cant do it
Overwatch,not_removed,it would make widow extremly op since she would have more time to aim and her weapon is hitscan so you wouldnt be able to dodge it
Overwatch,not_removed,jeff recently said lucios original ult was him going into bullet time and everyone but him slowing down i assume they changed it because of how obsurdly op that is esp back then when lucio did more damage
Overwatch,not_removed,yeah thats what i was trying to get at
Overwatch,not_removed,his ult is really shit to be fair
Overwatch,not_removed,my bad i realize now i shouldnt have helped you
Overwatch,not_removed,httpsgfycatcomsparklingjubilantaegeancat
Overwatch,not_removed,oh shit i read this wrong dreams crushed
Overwatch,not_removed,yes thank you
Overwatch,not_removed,wat
Overwatch,not_removed,im sorry i still think it would be a nice change though hes still very easy to kill while ulting but it would give the mccree at least some chance to counter back
Overwatch,not_removed,we get it youre an asshole congratulations
Overwatch,not_removed,there honestly isnt a more appropriate reaction than that i just blanked out when i watched it too like wat how
Overwatch,not_removed,or should i just do what you did and comment on peoples questions with completely irrelevant statements perhaps ill go look for questions and comment about random episodes of pokemon thats tantamount to what you did sure your first response was fine flickshot alright i get that but then i reiterated the more pressing first part of my question and then you decide to take the time to comment about dva why what part of that dva statement was applicable helpful or even remotely a good idea given the context
Overwatch,not_removed,clearly he shot his own bullets to split them in tiny pieces to frag headshots em all mccree pro
Overwatch,not_removed,we get it youre an asshole congratulations
Overwatch,not_removed,try thinking next time before you post then clearly you cant even provide a reasonable defense for yourself
Overwatch,not_removed,we get it youre an asshole congratulations
Overwatch,not_removed,we get you have nothing to contribute least of all for yourself congratulations
Overwatch,not_removed,no no it doesnt at all being a flick shot does not explain how he can be hit without the cursor being over him thankfully some other people more knowledgeable on the matter answered you however clearly didnt watch the clip closely at all because genji didnt use his dash at all its not part of this clip im not trying to say im not an asshole but you people are fucking morons that lack some very basic visual cognition
Overwatch,not_removed,we get it youre an asshole congratulations
Overwatch,not_removed,we get it youre useless congratulations
Overwatch,not_removed,we get it youre an asshole congratulations
Overwatch,not_removed,we get it youre useless congratulations
Overwatch,not_removed,we get it youre an asshole congratulations
Overwatch,not_removed,we get it youre incapable of actual contribution congratulations
Overwatch,not_removed,do you have autism
Overwatch,not_removed,because i can
Overwatch,not_removed,not cool bud
Overwatch,not_removed,the mei skin was changed cause her ass was a shelf
Overwatch,not_removed,whats the issue with the dragonblade im not familiar
Overwatch,not_removed,what does qol mean and what dragonblade colour discussion
Overwatch,not_removed,well its good pr for them turning their mascot character gay and creating female characters embodying roles which are stereotypically masculine heavy weapons guy giant robot with a minigun has given them greater exposure by media which otherwise wouldnt cover overwatch as much as it does now as well as attract audiences who otherwise mightve not heard of or cared enough to buy the game still the heroes we got are good and fun and the tracer comic wasnt a big deal and has no impact on the content development and support since its a drawn comic no game development involved issues like oni genjis blade going green rather than red for the user when drawn is more negligence by blizzard and prioritizing the development of new content rather than look back at and tweak old ones which are unavailable its not that theyre understaffed or obsessively absorbed with some sjw agenda their content development teams are simply assigned tasks that they prioritize over other things in need of fixing or tweaking you can question them over some of that but this whole lgbt community over others is a bit farfetched psi would like a big scary and manly killer robot however jeff less beep boop and more i will terminate you where is jeffrey kaplan
Overwatch,not_removed,i really like the development of heroes that weve seen like tracer and symmetra i appreciate how organic the development has been because it makes these heroes less of tokens its more like theres a hero with these abilities and btw shes gayautistic neither done obviously or out of the way of normal storyline as for your op i believe separate depts work on those changes so comparing them doesnt really make sense with that being said i do agree that theres a few design tweaks that should be updated tracers rose golden guns as another example
Overwatch,not_removed,mei was fixed because her character model was all out of proportion it looked weird i cant see how fixing an artistically imperfect hero is appeasing the lgbt community
Overwatch,not_removed,minor uproar k
Overwatch,not_removed,im just gonna go ahead and report this thread that title is bullshit theres nothing in here about lgbtq stuff at all is just being a dick
Overwatch,not_removed,what
Overwatch,not_removed,the color doesnt change from green when you pick ie the carbon fiber skin where it should be blue edit when you apply the golden weapon effect
Overwatch,not_removed,quality of life
Overwatch,not_removed,nice try csgo
Overwatch,not_removed,considering we cant even import our own sprays i highly doubt this will be a thing it will also lead to a lot of things like cods custom decalssymbols and people would just put rudevulgar things on it
Overwatch,not_removed,next thing you know youll want us to buy them haha
Overwatch,not_removed,an amd can play it but it wont be pretty since the has the igpu built in it will depend heavily on the ram you have as that is what it uses the higher speed the ram the better igpu performance you will get see what ram you have now what the top end your motherboard will support and go from there the was great back in the day but the igpu on your is better as a suggestion buy a card if you can with the you are going to play on low settings and barely squeak by at but at it should run alright lowmedium settings the apu itself isnt that powerful anyways so it will limit your fps how much not a clue if you can get an ati or nvidia you would be much better off if you can find them used locally the price shouldnt be to bad however im in the us and have no idea how pricey those can be in aud you can also try rhardwareswap or rhardwareswapaustralia for used ones this might be a good resource to keep prices down
Overwatch,not_removed,i have a feeling that neither of these cards is supported by overwatch check out this link but regardless id suggest buying a new gpu there are plenty of new ones that are reasonably priced so look around
Overwatch,not_removed,if i dont get the can i still play overwatch just the samefirst time buying a pc if you havent noticed
Overwatch,not_removed,the wont work with my pc but im probably gonna get a gtx and my brother says i need a new power supply but pc part picker says i dont need a new one i have a dynapower power supply will i be ok
Overwatch,not_removed,could you suggest any gpus
Overwatch,not_removed,you can play without the yeah i just gave ya some more options should you want to upgrade since i was in the same situation about a year ago
Overwatch,not_removed,a is really really good for its price would be able to play most modern game at max other than overwatch
Overwatch,not_removed,as far as good cheap gpus go i think a would also be a safe bet
Overwatch,not_removed,ok thx
Overwatch,not_removed,yea i had a look around yesterday and i found a local brand new for so im saving up for that
Overwatch,not_removed,that poor roadhog
Overwatch,not_removed,oh shit i was in that game underperforming as zen and my friend was mercy p nice one tho
Overwatch,not_removed,all he wanted to do was kill that year old korean girl he didnt deserve this
Overwatch,not_removed,thats awesome man d
Overwatch,not_removed,he was trying to avenge his friends to take down the one who massacred an entire military division by herself he was just hunting a monster edit okay you only got kills other than roadhog whatever p
Overwatch,not_removed,everyone in a frantic hurry to get play of the game
Overwatch,not_removed,basically 😂 as it was going on i was like wtf is even happening anymore everyone just spaming shit lol
Overwatch,not_removed,here is a clusterfck of my own from a season comp match won a clean point round and match with a team kill everyone on point and working together sorry for the loud audio in the background of my computer turbine lol my mic was on from the match as i had recorded this to fraps just after
Overwatch,not_removed,great job
Overwatch,not_removed,not riptire probably not blizzard also since they are separate entities
Overwatch,not_removed,people will get dc all the time
Overwatch,not_removed,people can and do get banned for the whole season if they leave repeatedly punishments get larger every time they leave they cant just automatically give everyone season bans on first offense considering things like ddos attacks happen power goes out internet cuts out etc
Overwatch,not_removed,as someone else said yeah go ahead and get a full team but werent you around during the big ddos that happened a month back lots of people got disconnected you wouldnt have a lot of people to play with or against if people got banned for just one dc also even with friends i was grouped up with on occasion one of us would get disconnected so just cope with it
Overwatch,not_removed,that just part of comp get a full team if you dont want to deal with that
Overwatch,not_removed,last season i had a leaver in my team games in a rowthats points lost without anything you can do about it yeah
Overwatch,not_removed,play with players in a group dont solo queue leaving mid game will happen less often this way but it will still happen occasionally from dcs i know this seems obvious to some but there will always be solo queuers
Overwatch,not_removed,obs or shadowplay or other recording software
Overwatch,not_removed,i use fraps to record then i use handbrake to compress and reduce the file size
Overwatch,not_removed,you cant do it from in overwatchyou have to use a recording software obs shadowplay playstv etc
Overwatch,not_removed,ability cancelling would make certain heroes sort of too good genji having to sit there during deflect or being forced to use dash to get away from a winston he didnt know is there is good it forces him to be more careful wraith form is similar becoming completely invincible is obviously amazing the drawback is that the enemies know when its going to end every single time its just for the sake of balance and consistency more than anything if it was up to me and i was being selfish then yeah id make abilities cancelable because i like a higher skill ceiling that said i think it would be bad for the game
Overwatch,not_removed,i did basically all of my levelling from rank and a hefty chunk of it from then on until in ai matches you get less exp overall but get the same amount of exp regardless of the difficulty i probably played most games on medium hard is great fun if you have a halfdecent team but ive got my ass handed back to me by the hard ai more times than i care to admit lol playing a majority of ai matches on most nights for about two hours a night took me from level to in a smidge over months to me the only games that are noticeably shorter versus ai are assault maps like hanamura and anubis where on attack you can often curbstomp both points in just over a minute id say its more helpful in terms of letting people fully get to grips with all the different character playstyles in a lowpressure environment and also with just being able to you know actually have fun
Overwatch,not_removed,i think its less exp quick play is the easiest way to level afaik
Overwatch,not_removed,yeah just tested it with a quick easy ai game for a win and for a silver so it seems to be exp rate
Overwatch,not_removed,but you dont need to deal with other humans the health benefits from that alone stress toxic behavior surely must exceed that exp
Overwatch,not_removed,well im on not having to deal with any sort of chat removes most toxicity
Overwatch,not_removed,there are a number of threads in this subreddit where people effectively hunt down others post game just to insult them that would suggest otherwise
Overwatch,not_removed,those seem easily ignorable the person in question may not even use reddit whats the point of trying to insult them here
Overwatch,not_removed,not on reddit posts to reddit complaining about people stalking them via the psxbox social networks to send messages directly to players
Overwatch,not_removed,there is an option to make it so nonfriends cant message you at least on
Overwatch,not_removed,so people send the friend request first then insult later just like they do in hearthstone
Overwatch,not_removed,then you remove them and go about your day its not like toxicity is inescapable
Overwatch,not_removed,ive started using my defense abilities early in prep for the flash works fairly well also i feel roadhog does nearly the same thing
Overwatch,not_removed,hell yes p
Overwatch,not_removed,no you are the only one to feel that way
Overwatch,not_removed,its usually that from a surprise mccree or a good widowmaker that i find annoying from time to time
Overwatch,not_removed,roadhog here its not enough to kill me and then i hook the poor guy you cant fight him with the same strategy you fight other characters
Overwatch,not_removed,hes a close range brawler i honestly dont have much of a problem with him
Overwatch,not_removed,its annoying especially when you are tracer and genji but thats when you start playing against it and try to bait out flashbang and avoiddeflect it
Overwatch,not_removed,his fan the hammer needs to have a cooldown kinda like lucios right click a damage reduction can also work too the thing is most mccrees get kills though the hammer ive never seen a good mccree
Overwatch,not_removed,it is the stun is perhaps fine its just that he can gib you while stunned and there is nothing you can do about it if a reaper gets the jump on you you can do something if youre fast enoughmcree nopenot unless hes really slow or bad with his follow up i feel if reapers shift could get out of the stun this would make mcree less viable as a counter to all squishes
Overwatch,not_removed,oh look more bad players that cry about mcree learn to counter learn to not get close learn to play the game
Overwatch,not_removed,i feel pretty good everytime i fan someone down i dont feel like that should make someone feel bad though just means they got out played
Overwatch,not_removed,atleast the roadhog hook takes the slight bit of skill that the mcree stun doesnt
Overwatch,not_removed,you are one of the better players instead of whining about him you just counter him like you should do in this game and honestly i dont understand why people are only whining about mccree when roadhog actually does the same thing but from a range i can survive mccree stun fan combo every now and then although its easy to avoid in the first place but i havent survived roadhog combo yet
Overwatch,not_removed,mains mcree
Overwatch,not_removed,outplayed hahahahahaha
Overwatch,not_removed,outplayed by a skill that literally leaves you completely defenseless and requires no skill to use where is the potential for counterplay
Overwatch,not_removed,i can survive mccree stun fan combo every now and then if the mccree has a single solitary braincell then a flash fanfire will always do damage anything but a tank will die in under two seconds and even tanks cant survive after a roll and fanfire
Overwatch,not_removed,lol i actually play reinheardt mostly so youd think i would want mcree nerfed but i just play against him the same way i would a reaper or roadhog
Overwatch,not_removed,this is the same thing that mei does
Overwatch,not_removed,not walking blind into a mcree its really easy to out range it
Overwatch,not_removed,it has spread unless you are very close to the target you can easily miss some shots only big targets are the ones that almost always take the full damage at flashbang max range
Overwatch,not_removed,as as reinhart though you are probably the most protected against mcree he has to get the flashbang right to hit you over the shield and then i dont think hes got enough damage to kill you in hammers
Overwatch,not_removed,except mei takes about seconds to do mccree is instant and can kill tanks with it by rolling for an instant reload
Overwatch,not_removed,mei also does a lot less damage than mccree with a lot less potential for killing you say youre junkrat and you get flashbangd fanned youre dead hands down mei tries to freeze you oh leftshift away im fine
Overwatch,not_removed,so i take it you main widowmaker and never walk through any doorways or choke points ever just outrange it bro
Overwatch,not_removed,ive had a mccree flashbang me in the air as pharah i dont believe you
Overwatch,not_removed,only big targets are the ones that almost always take the full damage at flashbang max range anything that isnt a big target isnt a tank anything that isnt a tank will die to just three or four out of your six shots say what you want but once you are flashbanged without being close to an attentive teammate you are toast
Overwatch,not_removed,mccree easily kills him in two getting the flash over isnt difficult either its more about whether or not the other team lets rein die what i do in a game with better players is just coordinate it and flashfan teammates rein dies better than suiciding
Overwatch,not_removed,i certainly never walk through a choke first as widow
Overwatch,not_removed,to be honest if you get flashbanged as a pharah you deserve it the range on flashbang is like meters or so to get a kill with the combo with decent consistency you have to be within meters against the human sized models if you get flashed in the air you are firstly in the wrong place and secondly youd still get out of it unless mccree gets lucky
Overwatch,not_removed,reaper and mei have enough hp to often survive it zarya is very hard to kill with it roadhog is hard to kill since he can easily hook you after the stun and instakill you even tracers can just recall out of it alive sometimes throwing a flashbang doesnt guarantee a kill play the hero first dont just judge it by the times you have died to it
Overwatch,not_removed,unless you are roadhog
Overwatch,not_removed,sorry let me delete the part where i implied you would doesnt change anything
Overwatch,not_removed,reaper and mei have enough hp to often survive it absolutely not landing shots isnt difficult at all play the hero first dont just judge it by the times you have died to it i played him for roughly hours now and that doesnt change my opinion at all he is too good
Overwatch,not_removed,if you know you will get abused before you get abused then clearly you know that you are doing something that is controversial or something that will wind up your team you should be asking yourself what am i doing that causes people to be angry at me once you find the answer to that question you can stop doing it
Overwatch,not_removed,you probably instalock widow and refuse to swap champs if youre not hitting your shotsthats probably why youre getting bullied
Overwatch,not_removed,thats cool so what do you think reddit will do about it
Overwatch,not_removed,admit your mistakes to your team acknowledge them and apologise sorry man i couldnt bubble you because my shield was on cooldown my bad i wasted amp it up on heals give me seconds before we can speed in however if youre making detrimental picks that influence the team instead of gameplay mistakes then you deserve to be called out if your genji or widow are awfulnot hitting shots then honestly youre better off playing a to save potential ult charge being given to the enemy supportsdps
Overwatch,not_removed,thank you everyone for the things to think about
Overwatch,not_removed,often i am made fun of for having a high voice
Overwatch,not_removed,rant
Overwatch,not_removed,its amazing wow
Overwatch,not_removed,thats wicked a sombra one would be so cool

Overwatch,not_removed,oh man id love to buy one of these great work
Overwatch,not_removed,i would absolutely love a lucio one with his signature dj callsign the frog one how much would this cost me
Overwatch,not_removed,i expected to open this and see a piece of shit this is awesome
Overwatch,not_removed,bastion would be cool the circuit board would go with him perfectly
Overwatch,not_removed,id be all over a mercy pendant
Overwatch,not_removed,if you ever make a mercy one ill definitely buy it the pendant is amazing
Overwatch,not_removed,i give it a
Overwatch,not_removed,this is so sick where do you work that you have the time to make this
Overwatch,not_removed,could i ask how much a zenyatta one would cost if you were able to make and sell one
Overwatch,not_removed,i would love to buy a tracer one
Overwatch,not_removed,those are so cool amazing after watching a crap load of clickspring videos i love this kind of stuff and i thought my creation was cool httpsimgurcomgalleryvddoj just a small print i did at my school
Overwatch,not_removed,thanks i started working on a widowmaker one with purple board gotta use those redundant computer parts for something p
Overwatch,not_removed,i can do that
Overwatch,not_removed,it especially fits in with the technologyhacker theme
Overwatch,not_removed,oh hey buddy long time no see
Overwatch,not_removed,i can do mercy i had some goldish board but it was rather hard to get a clean piece send me a pm if you want
Overwatch,not_removed,cheers if people want to buy them i can certainly make them ive got a few designs in mind already
Overwatch,not_removed,sure i could do that pm me if you want
Overwatch,not_removed,lol cheers
Overwatch,not_removed,will do
Overwatch,not_removed,will do
Overwatch,not_removed,australian if your interested pm me
Overwatch,not_removed,no worries just drop me a pm
Overwatch,not_removed,great idea some of the sprays would look awesome too
Overwatch,not_removed,can do send me a pm
Overwatch,not_removed,lol people are loving mercy i can totally do that
Overwatch,not_removed,im a jeweller i had finished my jobs for the day and had a couple of hours till closing so i thought why not you have to make stuff you enjoy and thats different every so often to stay sane
Overwatch,not_removed,im doing them for zen would look cool
Overwatch,not_removed,no worries just pm me
Overwatch,not_removed,they thats awesome you could do one of those clicky lid things for travel coffees too what kind of printer did you use i got my dad an xyz printer for xmas as he is always making cool stuff in his shed i thought he could use it
Overwatch,not_removed,i would totally buy a widow one
Overwatch,not_removed,i feel some sketchy vibes in that friendship
Overwatch,not_removed,what do you exactly work at
Overwatch,not_removed,i would so buy a mercy one
Overwatch,not_removed,i need a junkrat one how much
Overwatch,not_removed,for aus i would totally buy a sombra one
Overwatch,not_removed,thats a bit steep i understand that it is handmade but what other materials are you using that make it that price silver gold
Overwatch,not_removed,do you plan on this being a limited time thing or would you be making these for a while these would make amazing gifts around the holidays for good friends and would have some more spare money around then
Overwatch,not_removed,that is a good idea i used the makerbot replicator
Overwatch,not_removed,cool if your serious pm me i can show you a few progress shots if you want
Overwatch,not_removed,im a jeweller
Overwatch,not_removed,im doing them for australian pm if your interested
Overwatch,not_removed,ill send you a pm with my email
Overwatch,not_removed,all the metal is silver i can use gold but they would be more its hand made as you say and takes a few hours to do of which you cannot fully charge for plus im a trained craftsman and i believe in what my time is worth for example i can make a platinum diamond ring to hold a diamond or the same ring out of silver with a cz in it the price difference would be massive but i would charge the same for the labour involved and as i mentioned often you cant charge for all of the time in order to stay competitive i understand where you are coming from though mate and im glad you like the design
Overwatch,not_removed,no time limit as long as i dont move house and still have a workshop at home i can do them whenever anyone wants one
Overwatch,not_removed,im a bot bleep bloop someone has linked to this thread from another place on reddit footerif you follow any of the above links please respect the rules of reddit and dont vote in the other threads rtotesmessenger messagecomposetortotesmessenger bot
Overwatch,not_removed,the community found the exact font dont remember the name sorry the and os werent a problem but the is and ls are indistinguishable iirc there are digits in the code that are either i or l so there is permutations if you used one of the password checker sites then mostall of them automatically tested the password against all permutations so the font thing wasnt really the problem anyway blizz gave a different hint after the community got stuck on the tracer code for a while so it seems like we dont need to solve it any more
Overwatch,not_removed,heres my description of this arg nbsp you want to have a designing adventure do it while drinkin with a troll and only they could think up an arg like this heres my idea for a fucking reveal i put a clue in a video like a teaser fuck off teaser not a straight forward clue a little fucked up clue i slip a clue in video for people to see oh you mean like a leak fuck leaks i hide the clue so you have to look for it oh fuck ya big fun yeah oh like an easter egg fuck no not obvious i put shit in to hide it like codes and puzzle and cryptic phrases so you can lose you fucking way and go chasing leads that are fucking stupid pluggin away and each time youre wrong you feel like a fish taking bait fuck thats thats what well call it bait cause each time you chase dumb things you feel like a fucking moron oh great oh and heres the best part fuck this is brilliant right near the end ill put a little tease to give ya fucking hope but then ill put a count down to a count down to fuck with your mind again ay youll be there screaming your head off smacking your face on your keyboard and then you give them the character fuck no they wait fucking months thats my idea of an arg nbsp nbsp edit apparently my censorship bugged people so now its gone
Overwatch,not_removed,so there are four points in the code that can vary based on whether or not a given character is either an i or an l and then another two spots that are either or o since it does seem to be a different character in the spots at least this means there are only different configurations i admit im not a cryptography expert but if you already have the key to decrypt it then why would it be so much more difficult to run through permutations until it produces meaningful results or is the worry that the code might not look meaningful once decrypted but will instead need to be applied to something else to get useful information
Overwatch,not_removed,this is just painful read because of your shitty censoring
Overwatch,not_removed,fucking look around god damn its been an entire day with these threads popping up every ten minutes
Overwatch,not_removed,god i didnt see the threads myself but same here cool beans
Overwatch,not_removed,you lost everything in the past loot boxes i bet i saw a guy post this a month ago and his shit was disappearing they havent fixed it and it was only him at the time now its a lot of people
Overwatch,not_removed,who pissed in your cheerios i scrolled down a few pages and didnt see really no need to be a dick you could have posted a link or something
Overwatch,not_removed,got mostly gold would suck if i lost it though got enough to buy hella stuffs
Overwatch,not_removed,i could have been nice you could have also used the search bar to look for the hundred other threads about this this has been constantly popping up on new for the past day and im sure more of these are yet to come so youll have to excuse me for not catering to laziness after a point
Overwatch,not_removed,check because its prob a reset of some sort
Overwatch,not_removed,it was for server issues in the south east asia are but a bug have it to random people apparently
Overwatch,not_removed,in bird culture that is considered a dick move but i dont blame you xd
Overwatch,not_removed,you should be that was rad
Overwatch,not_removed,love it when you kill more than one person with a reinhardt charge im sure you were in the moment but another useful tip is you should line your e up before you charge so you can do more damage
Overwatch,not_removed,meh mediocre at best
Overwatch,not_removed,i wonder how effective a bastion there would be
Overwatch,not_removed,every time i say anyone need a boost no one ever replies
Overwatch,not_removed,no unfortunately
Overwatch,not_removed,unfortunately no its really frustrating blizzard hasnt added this especially since they updated the pc report system to be much more comprehensive when people have tried to contact blizzard about players they want to report they direct them to sony cuz its their network who then says they have to contact blizzard cuz its their game this is a priority imo for console but theres hasnt been any response yet when i encounter somebody i dont want to play with more than once i just stop playing comp for a while and hope i never run into them again its worked so far for me i dont hate blizzard and i dont think as some people do that they dont care about console whatsoever but this issue is frustrating
Overwatch,not_removed,blizzard is supposed to add a report system in the summer who knows when to be honest though
Overwatch,not_removed,thats what i was hoping would happen last night i sent him an angry message and thought thats was that and then tonight again i got stuck in a game with him again i really hope this is something they are working on to implement into the game
Overwatch,not_removed,either troll or cod baby
Overwatch,not_removed,to many hit kills what are you a zenyatta downvote shitpost and move on
Overwatch,not_removed,could i possibly introduce you to my friend reinheardt
Overwatch,not_removed,today op played an arena shooter and didnt like it the end
Overwatch,not_removed,want some salt
Overwatch,not_removed,looks like v is leaking
Overwatch,not_removed,i found the time to kill pretty high compare to other fpss i have played
Overwatch,not_removed,been playing some zenyatta havent you
Overwatch,not_removed,has been around for almost years and you think overwatch will shit down we can still play diablo on battlenet servers im sure star craft games are being played too
Overwatch,not_removed,or dva or
Overwatch,not_removed,after csgo it feels like it takes weeks to kill people in this game
Overwatch,not_removed,roadhog winston and zarya honestly there are plenty of options im not sure why he hasnt tried playing a tank if he wants to live longer
Overwatch,not_removed,laughed a little too hard
Overwatch,not_removed,yeah my point was any of the tanks
Overwatch,not_removed,my experience after hours of trying that game looked like this move get hit in the head and killed
Overwatch,not_removed,stop selfpromoting
Overwatch,not_removed,the neck is a little long but really well done
Overwatch,not_removed,the face is done right but its like stretched off the rest of the head and neck what the fuuuuuck what did you doooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo
Overwatch,not_removed,i compiled a bunch of clips i gathered over the competitive seasons and quickplays that i thought were pretty good theyre not the best and im still new to editing but i hope its still enjoyable none the less feel free to leave feedback and tips
Overwatch,not_removed,now those are some satisfying lucio boops well done on the clips
Overwatch,not_removed,thank you i dont get to play lucio too often but it feels good to deny ults with boops you get some really good reactions too haha
Overwatch,not_removed,all over again
Overwatch,not_removed,cool idea idk how that would be balanced maybe instead of his trap he got a flame thrower that lasted a certain amount of time and then went on cd neat idea though and first his personality
Overwatch,not_removed,what if junkrat was a stapler
Overwatch,not_removed,because of his weakness to being flanked flanking junk is one of the scariest thing i ever did as reaper he can nade mine burst you in less than a second at close ranges the main problem with junk is that he cant focus his damage at medium ranges only spam mccreesoldier kills him in that way
Overwatch,not_removed,hes not supposed to be a closerange hero like a pyro though his underpoweredness comes from the useless of his ultimate not his actual abilities
Overwatch,not_removed,oh man i just got the game and have been playing as junkrat cos hes the only hero i have any semi successful games using haha
Overwatch,not_removed,im not talking about making a pyrostyle flamethrower i mean a closer range lower damage one just something to give him a little bit more of the utility hes sorely lacking
Overwatch,not_removed,dva can protect his ult its not that useless
Overwatch,not_removed,lower your sensitivity a lot and slow down when you practice and slowly get faster and faster at shooting you might just be bad if you have that many hours in and are still bad though
Overwatch,not_removed,try this
Overwatch,not_removed,beer
Overwatch,not_removed,patience and and tme invested in proper aim drills everyday also never look at your crossheir when u aim try to look where u want to aim and drag the center of the screen to that point
Overwatch,not_removed,i usually create a custom match and switch it to headshot only afterwards i do against ana because ana cant head shot lastly i choose a hitscan hero i personally choose mccree abd practice aiming for the head against the anas
Overwatch,not_removed,as a hour csgo mge and player i dont know how much experience and time you have in overwatch but projectiles will be very hard to get used to try soldier and mccree for hitscans and get a good feel for the game and shooting is still very different but get used to hitscan dps before playing more niche heroes
Overwatch,not_removed,i dont know who you main but using a hero like soldier its much easier to aim shooting in shot bursts instead of holding down the left mouse button
Overwatch,not_removed,you can always use winston or symettra
Overwatch,not_removed,try to practice and lower you sensitivity
Overwatch,not_removed,play a lot
Overwatch,not_removed,play mercy
Overwatch,not_removed,that does work can confirm
Overwatch,not_removed,thats the complete opposite of what you want to do just cause youre not great at aiming doesnt mean you cant practice it doesnt hurt to try
Overwatch,not_removed,one of the benefits of maining mercy for me is that my team doesnt have to rely on my aim because im not frontline offence doesnt stop me from failing to shoot a stationary afk genji multiple times with my pea shooter from a few yards
Overwatch,not_removed,youre not the same person though so wtf and it has a lot to do with it dumbass
Overwatch,not_removed,np good luck
Overwatch,not_removed,try to increase your dpi and lower ingame sens your current set may be causing pixel skipping try dpi and sens
Overwatch,not_removed,nothing to do i would give you a quite good answer if you werent that much of a faggot retard with your response
Overwatch,not_removed,if im not the same person then either op so dont tell him to low the sensitivity
Overwatch,not_removed,this pixel skipping comes above but well it can only help yes
Overwatch,not_removed,also try aiming with your whole arm instead of your wrist this helps improve muscle memory
Overwatch,not_removed,dummy i dont know this word but well i still put my accounts into gm even if one demoted while i was uping the other but i dont feel comfortable with lower sensitivity since im a former flanker main
Overwatch,not_removed,dude i mean stop tell people to put their sensitivity lower i still put my accounts into gm even if one demoted while i was uping the other but i dont feel comfortable with lower sensitivity since im a former flanker main
Overwatch,not_removed,why not he asked for advice idk why you are trying to butt into the conversation as though your sensitivity is relevant to ops also youre english is a bit off idk exactly what your comment is supposed to mean
Overwatch,not_removed,dpi means dot per inch that your mouse will move on screen you can go to your mouse preferences and test some values if u got a razer one just open razer synapse and go to performance tab
Overwatch,not_removed,youre a dumbass dude its well known that lowering your sensitivity allows for a wider range of movement and better muscle memory you dont know shit shut the fuck up
Overwatch,not_removed,ok silver
Overwatch,not_removed,octuple kill
Overwatch,not_removed,oh its you i remember playing against you in comp the other day and you just mowed down our team when you switched to tracer
Overwatch,not_removed,httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvfygyrzmrhafeatureyoutube
Overwatch,not_removed,i have hours on tracer and consider myself to be pretty good with her but i can not play soldier for shit even though hes one of the most simple heroes out of the bunch
Overwatch,not_removed,
Overwatch,not_removed,same thing happened to me when i tried solider for the first time after like hours of tracer play xd
Overwatch,not_removed,try bastion or sombra next tracking skills favor bastion dva soldier sombra tracer and zarya
Overwatch,not_removed,lol that mecree just trying to run through a ult to flash its almost like he was tunneling like most mecrees or something
Overwatch,not_removed,ayy
Overwatch,not_removed,what kind of animal are you
Overwatch,not_removed,thats beautiful to see i love when mercy resses and i have my visor up most ive gotten was though not your lol ive started playing more tracer looking to main her next season instead of soldier wanted something more challenging
Overwatch,not_removed,hey thats my play of the game s
Overwatch,not_removed,that mercy rez fail
Overwatch,not_removed,wait delta is my name too didnt know there could be multiple
Overwatch,not_removed,i only play supports and tanks i suck at every other hero but unskilled or bosstion still wanna learn how to play tracer n
Overwatch,not_removed,got good aim zarya ult and his ult makes it so he dosent need to aim
Overwatch,not_removed,i see you also like to play overwatch on your nokia nice
Overwatch,not_removed,love the gamer tag youre the one that jacked it from me
Overwatch,not_removed,han great kid dont get cocky han sure that was a good combo but that mercy handed you potg under glass
Overwatch,not_removed,lol sorry love i honestly cant recall that
Overwatch,not_removed,huh so bungie made that into a multikill callout
Overwatch,not_removed,when i started learning soldier i treated him like a mobile bastion set up in the same places youd put bastion then start strafing and shooting dont get close like tracer stay safe and steady when on attack dont flank just stay behind rein and spam the enemys shield learn how to manage soldiers spread hold left click until the crosshairs bloom out then wait a second or two then repeat against large targets just hold down left click brainlessly use your rockets to finish off lowhealth targets
Overwatch,not_removed,haha holy crap how did you even see this in the video
Overwatch,not_removed,lag compensation on hanzos screen the arrow would have gone straight and hit
Overwatch,not_removed,i wouldve done it too flash headshot kill his ults gone
Overwatch,not_removed,he is ulting priority target his flash landed if lucio didnt come in and boop he would have gotten the kill and rip soldier ult that was a good play by the mccree
Overwatch,not_removed,i would have done it for the achievement d
Overwatch,not_removed,they get around the unique names thing with the numbers at the end of your name you might be but he might be if this was sarcastic then rip me
Overwatch,not_removed,thats the joke
Overwatch,not_removed,thats kinda what the title was implying
Overwatch,not_removed,no look in the bottom right of the screen dude
Overwatch,not_removed,ya havent played destiny in forever but i love it when lord shaxx goes ham
Overwatch,not_removed,get good with bursttap fire and tracking and soldier goes from spray and pray to laser cannon death sentance
Overwatch,not_removed,this is pretty on point i actually did this in the video knowing i was close to my ultimate and meant to flank em with it as my team continued to hold down in front by the time i got there my team had pushed them to the gate so no amazing flank haha
Overwatch,not_removed,idk i just saw that thing and it looked fucky so i paused it and saw this shit
Overwatch,not_removed,you do know its bad for you and your team to tunnel right
Overwatch,not_removed,played a match last night were the other mercy didnt rez her team that whole night waiting for the perfect moment just for the achievement we steamrolled them and it was still hilarious
Overwatch,not_removed,i completely missed the second part of the title i am a idiot
Overwatch,not_removed,theyre not im a dumbass
Overwatch,not_removed,i just remember seventh column being like a sub community on bungies old site plus the symbol showed up in maps like headlong and valhalla in halo
Overwatch,not_removed,shaxx absolutely loses it in year crucible
Overwatch,not_removed,brutal
Overwatch,not_removed,diddly dingdong ticktock
Overwatch,not_removed,it used to be a lot easier to do this until they put a recovery time on his spread i still prefer the old soldier you used to be able to burst fire way more consistently but did lower damage so they made his spread higher with a recovery time and gave him more damage he is a beast at the moment but he just doesnt feel as consistent as he used to you could pick a pharra out of the sky with ease from in the good days as long as you could put the crossgair on her and burst correctly now she can escape most of the time as long as she goes for cover i will concede it is nice melting roadhogs with him though now
Overwatch,not_removed,you know considering soldier just wrecked their entire team like twice it doesnt really matter what mccree did there nothing would save them the flash bang was just a fuck you soldier because they knew they wiped talk about httpsenwiktionaryorgwikirearrangethedeckchairsonthetitanic
Overwatch,not_removed,you know that is just my judgement i think it would be better to stop an in progress soldier ult hopefully saving some of my team if i only had hp i wouldnt bother but if i could take shots id definetely attempt it
Overwatch,not_removed,its not really tunnel vision when the target is currently the guy singlehandedly wiping your team if what he had down would have worked soldier would be dead and down an ult hell tunnelvision would be him trying to avoid but getting shot by everyone else
Overwatch,not_removed,thats why i dont have the achievement yet i cant just let my team die i dont hide in a corner often because there was a chance that healing the tank would have prevented the breach that killed us in the first place on matches that i actually know that my team is going to die i cant get a res anyway because the reason i knew we would get rolled was how spread out they were
Overwatch,not_removed,an
Overwatch,not_removed,bungie has a fascination with the number bundie day is industries and thereby guilty spark is just etc
Overwatch,not_removed,thats doable
Overwatch,not_removed,old soldier used to be able to have perfect pinpoint accuracy while firing at near full auto if you used a mouse macrointerrupt that led to some problems
Overwatch,not_removed,just have to master the anti air rockets
Overwatch,not_removed,oh i know delta halos monitor is also penitent tangent
Overwatch,not_removed,is actually cubed
Overwatch,not_removed,yea i always got downvoted to hell because i considered that a form of cheating exploiting blizzard did not intend for you to use a macro to give yourself perfect burst so its not okay to do it i was shocked to see how much of the overwatch community thought that using a macro to give yourself perfect burst was perfectly okay and that you cant blame anyone for doing it because the game allows it to me thats like saying its okay to glitch into the wall to get an advantage over the other team its one of the things that no matter how many people swear its okay will just never be understood by me i guess it doesnt matter anymore because blizzard patched it because of the abuse
Overwatch,not_removed,thats what means
Overwatch,not_removed,oh i thought you meant the number
Overwatch,not_removed,perfect use of voice line too
Overwatch,not_removed,i like how it says you were eliminated by yourself
Overwatch,not_removed,wouldnt you prefer to have the gun on the right side if you are lefty since otherwise it blocks most of your preferred side ive always wanted to switch it too but no you cant
Overwatch,not_removed,not as far as i am aware
Overwatch,not_removed,no sorry
Overwatch,not_removed,yeah and a written essay why you want to play competitive mode also some proof that you played competitive in other games too oh and ofc a pitcure of you wearing a headset with the current newspaper in it as proof this is bs im all for no rank req for this mode when they are bad they will end up down in the ranks after games and if they are goot theyll endu up on the top of the ranks and deserve it
Overwatch,not_removed,no
Overwatch,not_removed,no
Overwatch,not_removed,your criteria would disqualify the ranked player from playing ranked
Overwatch,not_removed,thats funny try better bait next time
Overwatch,not_removed,similar to hots but nah we need more tracer mains and first time tanks but seriously competetive should be avaible only from certain lvl
Overwatch,not_removed,probably most of the top really
Overwatch,not_removed,is that surefour still hes bad anyway dont worry about him
Overwatch,not_removed,something something tree logs
Overwatch,not_removed,i know this is a game but the image i took from here its like ugggggghhhh
Overwatch,not_removed,this will stop them
Overwatch,not_removed,yeah getting random dcs may ping is i play with no problems on gta online same goes fory friends i play with
Overwatch,not_removed,and after the lucio battle nobody in ilios could hear again nor was there a shard of glass left unbroken
Overwatch,not_removed,wut
Overwatch,not_removed,wrong sub
Overwatch,not_removed,your submission has been removed the reasons being your submission is not related to overwatch which is mandatory according to our rules if you have any questions please state them in an answer to this post for concerns or to contact the whole staff please with the removal of my submissionmessageim writing to you about the following submission issue is for more information please consult httpswwwredditcomroverwatchwikirules
Overwatch,not_removed,lookyet another video with someone playing the game its not like this sub is full of em
Overwatch,not_removed,once you get all the weapons you get all the weapons its no different to any of the other cosmetic items in the game or the achievements that you can only do once
Overwatch,not_removed,i feel like winston does need something but not too sure what since i dont play him maybe change health to armor or something similar to genji where you get your leapjump back after a kill to help escape
Overwatch,not_removed,either buff barrier hp or shorten the cool down as it stands winstons barrier lacks the longevity or the frequency of deployment to truly be a game changing ability
Overwatch,not_removed,winston could use a lower cd on barrier for sure and if genji can dash out of gravitin he should absolutely be able to jump out
Overwatch,not_removed,i think we shoulda have new hitbox so we wont get oneshoted by hog hook combo i mean this head is way low placed whats the point of hp if u get destroyed like a hp glass
Overwatch,not_removed,i main winston too and i do just fine so it must be youre doing something wrong
Overwatch,not_removed,the barrier nerf had nothing to do with stacking it was because it was so strong that people ended up waiting it out completely plus winston got a jump cd buff later to compensate
Overwatch,not_removed,im in favor of him getting his jump back after he kills someone also letting him jump out of zaryas ult
Overwatch,not_removed,i do fine as well hes just inconsistent the other team must have a specific lineup to use winston effectively
Overwatch,not_removed,i was under the assumptions that it was nerfed due to stacking my fault
Overwatch,not_removed,thats because he isnt in the meta
Overwatch,not_removed,i honestly would hate for this to happen the reason that pc players arent playing with the consoles is because of the ability gap that the two control schemes creates the keyboard and mouse people are just going to dominate anyone on a controller
Overwatch,not_removed,there are several gadgets you could buy for eg hori tac or geht a xim you will be hatet for this but it s the only way i know to play on with mouse and keyboard
Overwatch,not_removed,buy a xim i dont have one myself so i couldnt tell you how if feels or anything but its a cheaper alterative than a graphic card or anything fyi ppl call it cheating so be prepared to get bashed
Overwatch,not_removed,as a former console player i always wanted this to happen i would have used my console as a pc pretty much it would have been nice
Overwatch,not_removed,this has even been proven in testing and its why many games are not supporting crossplay right now theyve had the technology for years but it gives a super unfair advantage to keyboardmouse players against those who are using a controller im sure that there are people out there that can use a controller like a boss but that percentage is extremely low as compared to a pc player
Overwatch,not_removed,who says you need a gpu to play this game my current graphics card cost me and i can play on epic settings with a constant so you dont need something costly at all to run the game on pc even if you get the worst of the worst the game actually looks fairly decent on low settings you could get a gpu and run on at least medium settings without issues at all i know this because my roommate uses one
Overwatch,not_removed,idk i dont play in pc lol i was just using it as an example might have been a bad one but still an example
Overwatch,not_removed,im pretty excited for the blizzard buff i want the patch now
Overwatch,not_removed,ahh shes so cute
Overwatch,not_removed,we are all going to suffer now
Overwatch,not_removed,i didnt think increasing the radius would do much i was all for decreasing the freeze time but this buff is wonderful
Overwatch,not_removed,cancer what do you mean by that
Overwatch,not_removed,some people relate pharah as cancer dnt know why p
Overwatch,not_removed,i gave up playing last night due to three dodgy games in qp first game we actually tried i healed my mate tanked a formula weve used since launch we got stomped hard no worries competitive is on break they were just better players well move on second game despite me almost instalocking tracer no one picked any healers common issue so well let it pass i guess ill practice zen for bad game but we won third game was awful again despite choosing tracer my friend this time wanted to offense too so went hanzo no one picked a tank or a healer and we were forced to fill those roles not that it did us any good as it was another stomp i know its not going to last for long but its so disheartening to face vastly superior players especially when all you really want to do is practice tracer and try for her special delivery achievement
Overwatch,not_removed,ow becomes damn near unplayable in off season yep i do not play it in the off season gave me something to do but that is all the only other thing i do is test hypotheses about character interactions in custom games so i can use them in real games to my advantage for example with dva getting buffed i practiced beating her consistently with my main and learned some neat tricks to bypass defense matrix
Overwatch,not_removed,i also want to mention try playing the ptr if you want as long as you dont mind not working on your live accounttoward more loot boxes it can be a refreshing experience ive encountered much less toxicity in the ptr its still there but definitely much less the majority of the players in the ptr are there to test and play the game
Overwatch,not_removed,my buddy and i played for about hours tonight and won only one match if my buddy picked a tank the randos would decide to double tank on attack not once match did a rando pick a healer saw an ana once but it was a lvl player who switched after one death and dont get me started on the enemy spawn camping us even on matches without the payload most infuriating thing i have ever dealt with second behind soldier ultimate and road hog chain both hitting mr around or through corners and walls i felt like i was in hell surrounded by idiots ive never had a night as bad as tonight
Overwatch,not_removed,the report categories were updated in the last patch this makes me believe that the overwatchteam is very well aware of the mass toxicity within the community by updating this it seems to me that they will and are able to go through reports more efficiently and take the correct action against said players
Overwatch,not_removed,i do that pretty often in fact i find people are a lot nicer there for some odd reason most of the time you will hear the its off season why do you care like the only reason anyone ever plays the game is to and for rankwhen its not since at launch there was no rank plus losses still effect your profile i think there should be a penalty for doing literally nothing in a match these trolls just jump up and down in spawn so they wont get kicked but do little else or they run around the point and allow others to kill them there should still be some kind of loss for leaving about of my losses tonight were due to rage quitters
Overwatch,not_removed,i hate it too the new category for this report is griefing
Overwatch,not_removed,i hope they in fact do do something about it if two teams report them even the enemy its at least something to look into
Overwatch,not_removed,driverscloudcom
Overwatch,not_removed,i have a and i run game stable at avg cpu load with epic settings have gtx
Overwatch,not_removed,my current basic system specs motherboard asus rog viii gene processor gpu gigabyte nvidia gtx memory nbsp running everything at epic settings with the exception of extremely rare out of video memory errors i have a decent average because of that i dont think theres anything wrong with your hardware setup unless theres some malfunctioning parts
Overwatch,not_removed,i am having the same damn problem and its irritating me to no end msi gtx msi with chipset brand new windows installed any help would be highly appreciated
Overwatch,not_removed,did you run
Overwatch,not_removed,i ran the detection and have a summary now what do i do with it thanks
Overwatch,not_removed,gt hardly able to get fps on lowest settings possible bg nwp
Overwatch,not_removed,what fps setting and how much
Overwatch,not_removed,what is your render scale defaulted to when you set it to epic
Overwatch,not_removed,what is your cpu usage with these settings it seems as if ops issue isnt necessarily with fps but is concerned about the high cpu usage which brings the spikesfreezes
Overwatch,not_removed,thats the part im not sure about im afraid its hardware related issues im not sure how to tell if its defective hardware as of now if i run epic fps cpu temp load gpu temp load if i run epic at fps temps all stay about the same and load will increase by double however cpu will spike to sometimes is this normal
Overwatch,not_removed,install every single driver that the page tells you
Overwatch,not_removed,unlimited frame rate cap stable fps
Overwatch,not_removed,
Overwatch,not_removed,iirc only around during a game so still plenty of headroom maybe its worth knowing what other programs besides the performance monitors are running in ops background while playing
Overwatch,not_removed,could you provide some photos of your hardware setup including interior several if needed back panel plug setup
Overwatch,not_removed,awesome ill give it a try havent installed the latest driver for the gpu yet
Overwatch,not_removed,hmm interesting mine shoot up to around fps but load hovers around thanks for the information
Overwatch,not_removed,not much just hwinfo rivatuner and corsair utility software i close down cam and corsair link
Overwatch,not_removed,httpimgurcomarfjpx rears a bit messy havent cleaned it up yet
Overwatch,not_removed,no processor performance caps on it by chance eg in power settings bios etc not to say that you actually changed the settings to such but just to cover all the possible causes of processor underperformance
Overwatch,not_removed,wasnt that the very first brawl
Overwatch,not_removed,that was the very first brawl lol sorry buddy
Overwatch,not_removed,my bad

Overwatch,not_removed,go to options close options toggle is fixed and everything works the way youre used to its a bug
Overwatch,not_removed,cool thank you
Overwatch,not_removed,thats unfortunate i wonder if its intentional at all
Overwatch,not_removed,i dont seem to recall ever hearing that
Overwatch,not_removed,no there was never a story mode planned or advertised
Overwatch,not_removed,you are in fact wrong
Overwatch,not_removed,your wrong and im correcting you there is no story mode
Overwatch,not_removed,are you thinking of battle born by any chance
Overwatch,not_removed,you typed your instead of youre and im correcting you there is a huge difference between those
Overwatch,not_removed,permabanning accounts for behaviour may only end up in half of the community banned the most certain way for actions record a video of his behaviourwhere everything required is seen and make a ticket support team will get the ticket and itll be higher chances of something to be done since the violation is obvious unlikely it will end up in permaban but maybe with a seasonban
Overwatch,not_removed,get over it you whiny bitch
Overwatch,not_removed,games been out for a week dude no ones even near the skill ceiling yet even if they played in beta
Overwatch,not_removed,i still see plenty of new who are just tying to get the ropes of the games since the game hasnt even been out a month yet so you still have plenty of time also most of the better players well i wouldnt say better but more so players who had more playtime then you would be a higher level anyway
Overwatch,not_removed,no matter what time youll get stomped by enemy widowmakers who dont miss a shot and can do without a problem
Overwatch,not_removed,there are quite a lot of really dedicated players and these players alreaddy managed to get a high lvl so you wont come accros them all so often unless your playing extremely good not to brag for example im lvl and i play with lvl
Overwatch,not_removed,everyone isnt pro lol you will get matched based off of your skill no matter when you buy it you will find balanced matches
Overwatch,not_removed,you mean real pro or these die in a cancer ball flamer wannabe pros if first it will take some weeks or months more if you mean the second ye these people are from start there at any game
Overwatch,not_removed,and then theres me negative hit accuracy and cant hit a wall if i fling myself into it
Overwatch,not_removed,you will get matched based off of your skill not always had some plays against lvl and our team was like etc i know that lvl does not mean mad skillz but no doubt higher level has more experience of the game
Overwatch,not_removed,im constantly getting put up against widowmakers who are probably bleeding fps genre who dont miss any shots and put bullets into your head as if its the size of a planet im in europe though maybe it isnt that bad in usa
Overwatch,not_removed,so you miss and end up jumping off the map
Overwatch,not_removed,if we praise mercy players theyll keep playing mercy thats the big secret
Overwatch,not_removed,no one likes to heal read that and stopped because the rest will probably be bulls hit just like that statement
Overwatch,not_removed,competitivetournament matches hinge on mercy rez so its safe to say the rest of the roster is useless and all matches should be mercys vs mercys
Overwatch,not_removed,yeah mercy takes no skill thats why we treat mercy players like the hot gamer girls the girls are the ones actually playing mercy because they are worse at video games then men because they have bad reaction time
Overwatch,not_removed,this man is on to something
Overwatch,not_removed,thats so sexist
Overwatch,not_removed,you go girl
Overwatch,not_removed,i appreciate your measured response but im not an idiot i know the mercy brigade sent you out in front to try and make peace with me i plan to fight in this thread until every mercy player na posts here once ive lured them in i will lock the thread and throw away the key this is your grave mercy players you hear me this is your grave
Overwatch,not_removed,you really need to read the full post i talk about how even though healing isnt popular not me i love it everyone needs to play it for the good of the team go give my post a read and tell me what you think
Overwatch,not_removed,
Overwatch,not_removed,welcome to the stone age motherfuckers
Overwatch,not_removed,are you an idiot thats so sexist girls dont actually have worse reaction time you trump supporting bigot imwithher
Overwatch,not_removed,no gender was implied for it to be sexist though
Overwatch,not_removed,why would you start a post saying no one likes to heal then if you know you like it logically that makes no sense
Overwatch,not_removed,horrible
Overwatch,not_removed,by the way do women actually have slower reaction time google time
Overwatch,not_removed,hey i see your mercy flair are you a girl ill boost ur rank for some sexy pics dont bother if ur fat tho i dont like fat girls
Overwatch,not_removed,oh my god you ignorant masculine boar ugh
Overwatch,not_removed,yeah and jet fuel doesnt melt steel beams huh ill be youre one of those masculine boars that believes george bush didnt do just because hes a man your mercy flair fooled me youre just another one of them
Overwatch,not_removed,you boar ugh
Overwatch,not_removed,what region you at im eu and ive been experiencing the exact same problem since the ana update my rtt was always in the range before the update now its the exact same as yours really annoying
Overwatch,not_removed,im fine with it most of the time but there are some games where its almost unplayable i tried restarting my router but that didnt do anything if i actually use an ethernet cable it probably wouldnt be so bad
Overwatch,not_removed,i use ethernet cable and i still have this problem and since it started with the ana updated it makes me think blizzard made some changes with the server locations or something
Overwatch,not_removed,i feel like its an accurate representation of everyone trying to get into the ptr and get a look at oasis right now
Overwatch,not_removed,it feels a bit stupid not sure if i like that i mean if everyone has left the town what is with the cars and why a car is stronger and tougher than an ow hero d
Overwatch,not_removed,dva outside of her mech is useless there have been situations where ive intentionally damaged myself so i can get out of mech and spam through a doorway to kill unsuspecting mcrees and junkrats dva is best when not played as a full on tank and rather as a sort of disrupter by constantly repositioning and doing damage the whole enemy team as they push shes also a rather good way of getting rid of turrets i think there are a lot of people that just dont know how to play her well because as my second most played hero i frequently get gold medals with her
Overwatch,not_removed,dva is supposed to be useless outside of her mech the point of her being like that is that she can go in as she pleases with her mech die and still stick around to contest the objective and if they player is capable of staying alive long enough get her mech back to keep tanking mei is in trash tier because shes absurdly easy to counter if you have any sense of competency any damager has the ability to kill her before getting fully frozen and any decent team with the slightest sense of teammateawareness should be able to kill her before she has the ability to kill a frozen tankhealer mccree is a onetrick ponyi main him i know for a fact a decent genjipharahtracer can easily avoid his stun and kill him of all the people complaining about bastion his enteringexiting of his sentry mode is the least of their concerns changing this would have no impact on his ability to setup pregame spray down an entire team in one magazine nor would it change his ability to selfheal torbjorns turrets have such a range because they are easy to kill all it takes is a competent hanzowidowmakerjunkratgenjitracer to destroy it chances are after two or three turret eliminations torbjorn will probably switch heroes roadhogs purpose is to be a damagey tank same thing with symmetra they arent limited to the role they are given outside of hook range roadhog poses pretty much little to no threat he has no shield like zarya winston and reinhardt sure he can heal but its cooldown is long enough to be able to focus him down i feel at this point the only ones complaining are the ones who are too stubborn to switch from whatever hero they want to play to whatever hero needs to be played to counter the opposition
Overwatch,not_removed,whole point of dva is to be useless out of the mech
Overwatch,not_removed,i can agree with all of these but dva being out of her mech is like a second life almost and that pistol isnt terrible its pinpoint accurate with a good rate of fire and decent damage too it has travel time as well so you can shoot at a corner before the enemy lumbers around it taking rounds while you duck around the other corner
Overwatch,not_removed,mccrees right click aka fan the hammer is a a problem here in my opinion a short stun is okay from his flashbang what is not okay that if he gets in your face which he will he can and will right click you to the other side even if you are considered as a tank
Overwatch,not_removed,i think shitposts like this should get nerfed
Overwatch,not_removed,agree with everything except for tracer going up against toblerone turrets unless youve got ult or its occupied this is almost suicide
Overwatch,not_removed,and yet i can still take down loads of people with her the only way to get back into your mech is putting shots on people you can still do a crap ton of damage with her that is for sure
Overwatch,not_removed,i suppose i just dont think of her as as much of a tank along with roadhog i think shes designed to be able to withstand the a team fight and as long as you have a team to back you up youll be dishing out a decent amount of damage and i feel like as long as i time my reflect right i can win basically any maybe i just havent played her enough yet but i dont personally feel like shes weak i do play on console so maybe the gameplay pace makes a difference also i love playing outside of the mech because as long as i hang back i can actually dish out a reasonable amount of damage
Overwatch,not_removed,i mentioned her because given the right opportunity a tracer can go in on a turret while its firing at someone else damage it and recall if it starts attacking her then go back in to finish it off ive seen it done and done it myself with no damage taken
Overwatch,not_removed,yea i do it from time to time too but try to avoid it when i can ill also add that a dva reflect plus boost to get close is also effective against the turrets

Overwatch,not_removed,no offence but console seems so slow in term of dynamic and how can you miss this bomb against a rein ahah wp anyway
Overwatch,not_removed,yeah honestly with how you track and how clunky your aiming is im genuinely shocked at that hanzo for not killing you earlier hell mercy may have been able to out aim you hanzo was your only real threat here tracer can many heroes rein being particularly easy sometimes it just takes a while due to health pool and shield id work in your aim in practice room aim with your arm not your hand so its smoother other than that well done i guess
Overwatch,not_removed,yeah well this was on xbone i play on this is a friends clip the bomb missed but it got rein to turn around for some free damage
Overwatch,not_removed,the rate of new content in ow is really high in my opinion actually i feel extremely lucky with how well blizzard is treating us in wow im pretty sure we didnt even get a new raceclass to play every expansion once a year iirc though you did get an expansion on the map youre also not counting all the tweaking on existing characters that comes with new patches or any of the large events with alternative game modes and new content for existing heroes i dont think we have anything to complain about
Overwatch,not_removed,theres also been the special events which it doesnt seem like youre counting a new hero in overwatch is much more difficult to create than one in a game like lol or dota maps are an even more massive undertaking as it must cater to all of the characters in one way or another extra credits did a video actually talking about how the overwatch team have made it much harder on themselves to create new content and still maintain game balance you can watch them here
Overwatch,not_removed,the rate of new content in ow is really high in my opinion actually i feel extremely lucky with how well blizzard is treating us in wow im pretty sure we didnt even get a new raceclass to play every expansion once a year iirc though you did get an expansion on the map those are completely different genres of gaming though so its not a justifiable comparison just because they are both from blizzard overwatch is a shooter compared to other shooters puts out content slowly while i cant give a metric on new heros since most games dont have them of the shooters on the market release a map pack every months with maps youre also not counting all the tweaking on existing characters that comes with new patches or any of the large events with alternative game modes and new content for existing heroes i did count and speak about those last paragraph please dont downvote me without fully reading my post
Overwatch,not_removed,i dont downvote im giving my opinion i used wow as an example because its the only other game i played religiously im not familiar with other shooters but wouldnt you end up with like different maps i dont really see why youd want that anyway new heroes i get though
Overwatch,not_removed,fair enough and fair enough i dont mean to sound aggressive either like i said most other shooters on the market average around new maps per year some more some less while overwatchs maps are polished and pretty they arent really that complex they follow a traditional lane design sometimes with multiple floors sometimes with a small lane for flanks all interconnected some how also why wouldnt you want maps new heros are cool but its not going to give the same kind of variety as maps it changes the meta and opens new strategies but with a new hero your team comp is new hero youve already seen times between the two imo maps add much more variety and enjoyment for the player experience its content variety for those who want it and in the competitive scene as well
Overwatch,not_removed,i dont know it might just be because ive only been playing for a few months and i still havent figured out all the little things on all maps also i already get annoyed when i dont get my favourite map once after playing for hours imagine what the chances are of getting one particular map with different ones thats kind of how im thinking i suppose im also not saying no new maps ever but i kind of like this rate and ive always felt we get lots of new stuff although im a sucker for things looking pretty i might enjoy new skinsemotessprays a bit too much
Overwatch,not_removed,to eventually stop playing this game and get my life on track
Overwatch,not_removed,yay fellow pharah main
Overwatch,not_removed,to draw and vectorise chibi versions of all the overwatch heroes not just cutting and pasting the cute sprays but creating my own designs
Overwatch,not_removed,id like to reach diamond before i go into the air force too bad i have potato aim
Overwatch,not_removed,get master rank with an hero usually people rage when you pick torbjörn hanzo junkrat
Overwatch,not_removed,my goal get the levels ive a life job etc but do my best to get xp for leveling im currently
Overwatch,not_removed,to have fun i dont care that much about my sr i always get placed in plat and rank to diamond each season so i really dont care that much about it i know im not young enough with fast reactions anymore to be playing at gm level so as long as i have fun in each match win or lose then i continue to play the moment people get toxic to each other i leave the chat and if it starts happening continuously i just stop playing that night and carry on another time
Overwatch,not_removed,no goals here just want some evenish games win or lose
Overwatch,not_removed,my goal is to not get frustrated by toxic people and bevæpning toxic myself over the next games in that session its hard but im working on it
Overwatch,not_removed,to get out of gold elo hell and improve my winston
Overwatch,not_removed,sup
Overwatch,not_removed,good luck
Overwatch,not_removed,thanks
Overwatch,not_removed,thanks
Overwatch,not_removed,sorry they didnt show up on my screen so i kinda spammed it
Overwatch,not_removed,first rule of healing
Overwatch,not_removed,thats the way it is mccree camping in a side room with his finger on e goes wtf asshole why are you on payload alone get back here and support me
Overwatch,not_removed,yes they shouldnt be toxicthat is true however you should not be pulling out your pistol when your team is about to need heals having your staff out unless youre defending yourself or cleaning up a kill is what you should do
Overwatch,not_removed,i dont usually get yelled at as support but today i had just rezzed both our tanks and died during the animation as i was respawning the reinhardt said i could use some healing as if i was just ignoring him
Overwatch,not_removed,this was amazing
Overwatch,not_removed,i mean tbh i can play characters however i want too but when were all full health walking to a point id rather shoot with a piston than boost damage on someone that cant really even use it im still healing for pretty much all of the match but im not gonna sit afk on staff when everyone is full health
Overwatch,not_removed,are you making use of your right click itll give your target a damage buff so you can be useful without doing heals
Overwatch,not_removed,mercy main here i dont have the time to pull out my pistol at the beginning of the game i use my buff on widowmakers or bastions to get a early first kill from there its just fly around keeping those healthbars steady with the occasional buffs when i feel like someone is going to rush when in a crowded area i healbuff until i see a friendly winston or tracer getting the fuck out to fly towards them to save my angelic ass and to recover in order to fly back into the mess etc only on rare occasions i try to pull out my gun to protect myself when im alone always keeping a watch on an ally where i can fly to tldr i havent got time to make pewpew with this watergun
Overwatch,not_removed,yes you can play heroes however you want to i can also but i like to win so i play optimally
Overwatch,not_removed,at my mmr never seems to be useful i try to use it on some characters that are ulting or a camping bastion or something but most of the time i actually want to have fun lol
Overwatch,not_removed,it depends you can do the right click for the damage boost and get your damage from there or you pull out your pistol it has quite a lot of damage if you can hit headshots
Overwatch,not_removed,i would argue that a mercy who never uses her pistol isnt playing optimally it shouldnt be half the match but i get eliminations a game while winning and keeping the team alive
Overwatch,not_removed,im a shitter so i play with other shit people tbh i like playing mercy not as just fill support because she has the only gun i can actually hit people well with some reason so why did they give her a pistol if youre not allowed to use it
Overwatch,not_removed,i get a lot of headshots with her somehow since the bullets slow flow into a group of people just kind of make a line barrage of them at head level lol and its really good at taking down widowmakers
Overwatch,not_removed,i would argue the sameyou should use it but as the op says he uses it whenever his team is walking to the point or at full health which isnt optimal how you use it sounds smart and its how every mercy that knows how to play uses it pulling it out every time no one needs health is a bad idea though amping is very effective and is better than you pistoling some of the time
Overwatch,not_removed,you can use it its for self defense they gave it to her for selfdefense nothing more nothing less if for whatever reason she didnt need to defend herself it wouldnt be in the game you can use it outside of self defense but only if you know how and when to use it
Overwatch,not_removed,but what the hell is the point of the amp if no one can aim and hit people
Overwatch,not_removed,thatll show them whippernsappers
Overwatch,not_removed,tell me how you really feel fam
Overwatch,not_removed,that is a broken soloq man or just a kid in his lul

Overwatch,not_removed,looks great
Overwatch,not_removed,thats why soldier is always locked and loaded
Overwatch,not_removed,this is true quality
Overwatch,not_removed,some things can get toned down but the biggest fucking problem with this game is somehow it has shittier servers then diablos servers
Overwatch,not_removed,if theres a direct way of getting them sure if its randomly from loot boxes no thanks dont have the luck for that
Overwatch,not_removed,really havent really noticed it on the servers
Overwatch,not_removed,you do have a point i was thinking more on the line of a special themed loot boxes containing only a select number of items pertaining to the event maybe blizzard would be kind enough to award players one with every set number of wins etc just wishful thinking on my part
Overwatch,not_removed,its the ticks its horrible
Overwatch,not_removed,well just have to see how they handle special skills and the like i really hope well get the witch mercy skin shown in recall and in watchpoint gibraltar map for halloween
Overwatch,not_removed,you mean like counterstrike loot any esport tournament going on esport summer lootbox with new seasonal skins per hero or do you just mean a different section in the shop like with hearthstone cards buy normal lootbox or buy summer lootbox to be precise you want all time avaible boxes just with different lootpools or do you want limited time avaible ones where you only have like or months to gather those boxes and they might return later but are not always avaible
Overwatch,not_removed,funny thing is that whilst the game is obviously designed for pc first and blizzard is primarily a pc developerat least until recently the tick rate works really well on console because of the slower controls so for us there is almost no problem
Overwatch,not_removed,yes please yes blizzard take my money edit particularly something that can show off those legs ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°
Overwatch,not_removed,i was leaning more towards how hearthstone does it never played cs but that does sound like a good way to get more skins mainly want special skins that are available during a specific set of time to make it more special
Overwatch,not_removed,console still cant leave matches with their parties though its the little things
Overwatch,not_removed,mainly want special skins that are available during a specific set of time to make it more special yeah i can see that working weekly brawl could have a chance or after x games that you get a special lootbox that is only avaible due to certain events like blizzcon or big release of a new gameexpansion like starcraft and providing starcraft like skins for heros and icons and stuff or diablo and you could get a mercy tyrael costume etc would be interesting and would be a bit more exciting if you cant just throw on blizzard and unlock every skin would appreciate something like this
Overwatch,not_removed,lucky bastards id rather have error over this shitty tick rate
Overwatch,not_removed,ohh i wasnt pc shaming you guys have got it good i would have bought it on pc any day if my friends were there but yea maybe one day once there is a competitive scene ill upgrade pc and get it there
Overwatch,not_removed,hopefully it wont be too overly grindy if they choose to go in that direction at some point itd be nice if they gave you the box purchasable for those looking to get them a bit more quicker i do support the crossgame incentives might not be too popular as a whole though
Overwatch,not_removed,maybe youll get your fix with the eventual patch
Overwatch,not_removed,as a pc player tick rate is bad but its nowhere near unplayable
Overwatch,not_removed,i do support the crossgame incentives might not be too popular as a whole though yeah was just an idea there probably will be the option to buy the special lootboxes since blizzard wants to make money in the end they will just vanish from the shop after the event period is over so people who want to spent some money can do so while the ones who dont want to spent money have their chance to get them via playing the game can also just be seasonal themes instead of crossgame themes or pretty event heavy like lucio with blizzcon shirt and cap or something anyway cant wait for something like this to happen sadly while most of the skins we have are pretty cool and solid my personal taste is weird enough to not like most of them so changing them up throwing a bunch of new into the bucket is a nice and promising event
Overwatch,not_removed,maybe but competitive games go for so long that getting high records is extremely easy
Overwatch,not_removed,that name tho lol
Overwatch,not_removed,sexy i those shots on zayra were nuts for some reason i have a really tough time hitting her when i play mcree
Overwatch,not_removed,nice aim where did you finish last season i assume high
Overwatch,not_removed,whoever thinks he is aimbotting must not know what aimbotting looks like this guy just has good aim look he missed a bunch of shots too if he was aimbotting he wouldnt have people are so quick to assume cheating just cause someone is better than them
Overwatch,not_removed,itt wow someones better at video games than me
Overwatch,not_removed,greatest screen name ever
Overwatch,not_removed,my battlenet id is buttclench ive finally found my long lost brother
Overwatch,not_removed,is that a pro genji
Overwatch,not_removed,literally came here for a no russian type clip was not disappointed
Overwatch,not_removed,i like how mcree actually looks like dude from old movie the shadow
Overwatch,not_removed,have an up vote just for that glorious name
Overwatch,not_removed,its impossible to kill genji just git gud as this guy
Overwatch,not_removed,why did your ult go straight to and not
Overwatch,not_removed,nice aimbot cheater
Overwatch,not_removed,i love denying genjis
Overwatch,not_removed,you people are so dumb aimbots on the body huh
Overwatch,not_removed,yeah i call aimbot too tbh
Overwatch,not_removed,and now he gets to respawn and try again
Overwatch,not_removed,that aimbot edit why would you post a video of yourself cheating
Overwatch,not_removed,well for one when shes flashed she her head jitters really oddly which is super annoying
Overwatch,not_removed,no i understand shes so weird to hit also thanks
Overwatch,not_removed,seriously i honestly find her super hard to hit and shes already so tanky i feel she should have slightly larger hitboxes or something
Overwatch,not_removed,nah was highest
Overwatch,not_removed,thanks
Overwatch,not_removed,remember no japanese
Overwatch,not_removed,not all genjis are made equal
Overwatch,not_removed,ptr
Overwatch,not_removed,i doubt theres aim bot at play almost all the shots were bodyshots the only hack that i would say is a chance is a triggerbot
Overwatch,not_removed,i mean he misses four shots in the gif i doubt it very much so
Overwatch,not_removed,the perfect crime
Overwatch,not_removed,its possible tho lol also in cs u can choose which bone to lock on or have ure aimbot aim on but no this guy isnt cheating people jump to conclusions to quickly
Overwatch,not_removed,that will be fixed after ptr goes live its going to be ok
Overwatch,not_removed,this guys better than me so he must be cheating
Overwatch,not_removed,shes just headbanging to volkskyan metal
Overwatch,not_removed,damn dude you got robbed i got and i feel like that on genji was sick
Overwatch,not_removed,same but console
Overwatch,not_removed,still it should drain slower so that he can cancel it not instantly go away
Overwatch,not_removed,if youre referring to the on genji i mean he does scream japanese at the top of his lungs i would assume op just reactively stunned him when he heard the ult
Overwatch,not_removed,click hack the technical term is triggerbot
Overwatch,not_removed,youll type the word conclusions but not the word you
Overwatch,not_removed,i have almost hours in ow and even more in other fps games with enough xp you begin to be able to see this shit look up a video of someone aimbotting then rewatch this video i could careless if he is better than me but this video is not evidence that he is besides where is op to defend himself if he wasnt curious how he remains silent
Overwatch,not_removed,hahaha didnt you see he didnt miss a shor and that on genji immediatly after using ult i just call hacks
Overwatch,not_removed,thanks man
Overwatch,not_removed,it doesnt drain instantly it just drains times as fast as before ultimates that consume the ultimate meter when activated will now drain the meter more quickly second instead of second
Overwatch,not_removed,no i was thinking because of the fact he clicked on everyone very quickly after hovering over them but that can just be aim thats why i said it was the only one of probability not that he used it also that was the least fishy point since anyone with decent headphones should be able to do that
Overwatch,not_removed,i too instinctively shoot people who yell japanese on sight
Overwatch,not_removed,ah thank you i was blanking on the name
Overwatch,not_removed,sorry conlusjons
Overwatch,not_removed,i meant it is already active on ptr and will go through when ptr changes are applied to live
Overwatch,not_removed,what competitive rank did you make it to last season and of course he remains silent to you this has happened several times before where a high level player posts one of their better plays and scrubs crawl out the woodwork to call them a cheater he might be a cheater but you really cant make that kind of assumption just from one clip
Overwatch,not_removed,dude was in competitive its incredibly possible for someone at that rank to do this its also a highlight so its not exactly how good he is all the time
Overwatch,not_removed,some people will never learn man
Overwatch,not_removed,yeah ive noticed that it makes the cancel feature on his ult pretty useless right now regardless of if you shoot or not its going to anyway so you might as well try and at least get a damagelock on someone
Overwatch,not_removed,and yes i can ive seen enough aimbots to know when something is natural skill and program assisted watch and pay attention the perfectly smooth aim instant and the lack of missing a single shot even with not being able to see the target edit it was a purely skill play i would give him props but it clearly isnt
Overwatch,not_removed,he was rank and he misses several times in the gif also theres no point bringing up how much experience youve had in other games when this is my first fps and i was rank so it shows that despite all your time on them you havent really made any progress and shouldnt judge other people by your standards
Overwatch,not_removed,so you are telling me that despite me playing exclusively solo que that it is impossible for me to get trollleavers there is no way that i could have that happen to affect my rating besides you are missing the point i never claimed to be the greatest only that ive seen plenty of aimbots and this is one
Overwatch,not_removed,you didnt claim to be the greatest but you did say that youre experience in other fps games gives you the right to determine what an aimbot and what isnt despite the fact that your experience doesnt seem to have helped you get better as a player so i really doubt it should be used to justify your decision on when someone is cheating
Overwatch,not_removed,throughout history many nations and dynasties have had strategist who were unbelievably smart with war tactics but not the best fighters in the land were they discredited nope because im not the best fps player does not mean i do not know what im talking about
Overwatch,not_removed,impossible i need to win twenty games to rank up and loose a full rank if i loose even with leavers
Overwatch,not_removed,this ranking system is bullshit ive lost ranks and i can barely get rank up
Overwatch,not_removed,people didnt like the grind system win rank up lose rank down where you just need to play like games to reach max rank people wanted a competitive mode where teams who are good get up and people who are just lucky and win matches before they lose again will go down so blizzard came up with this good teams with or winloss will be going up people with or will only going down winloss means you are not good just average so you shouldnt be climbing ranks up until you get better and win out of matches
Overwatch,not_removed,winning like that is statistically unlikely their system is flawed like fck absolutely terrible system
Overwatch,not_removed,thats fucking retarded if i play games win and lose i expect to be the same rank of where i started not demoted or times how much fucking sense does any of that make
Overwatch,not_removed,if your you are in the wrong skill division while win rank up isnt necessarily the best system either wins loss is a god damn stupid system you shouldnt need a wr to rank up if youre better than your skill level it doesnt mean you can win of your games just from being better than the rest it is a player game not a
Overwatch,not_removed,looking at the ranking many teams have a winrate on competitive mode atm with wins on loss some teams are at wins and no loss might be unlikely for the average joe but for the competitive teams it seems reachable of the playerbase roughly is placed within rank the really bad ones went down to rank the really good ones went up to i see how this is a terrible system but it just works like people want it to work good players go up average joes remain within and bad players go down if you just win like an average coin toss you are not supposed to climb up in ranks you need to be better than average to get up their
Overwatch,not_removed,non sense but its the world we are living in if you atm arent scoring wins per lose you aint going up for sure system favors only the top teams who can pull this off extremly punishing for everyone else
Overwatch,not_removed,i just say this is what the competitive crowd demanded highly skill based game mode either you are better than most others and go up or you stay at your own level or maybe even drop
Overwatch,not_removed,the ranking system shouldnt just be for teams it should be for the majority of people who will play it i guarantee more people solo q then play in a party let alone more people play in solo or parties of rather than teams of people your logic is completely stupid if you think the entire ranking system should be based on the minority teams rather than everyone else solo qers or small parties
Overwatch,not_removed,the problem is even average joes hell even people with slightly positive win rates are getting demoted in rank because losses weigh much heavier than wins
Overwatch,not_removed,youre pretty much saying oh thats just how it is so if i said hey give me dollars and ill give you one dollar your just going to say okay sure thats just the world we live in no blizzard said this season wasnt going to be perfect and they are going to change things this i s something the fucked up on and will need to tweet if blizzard has half a brain they would make competitive mode for the of people who play it not the
Overwatch,not_removed,i guarantee more people solo q then play in a party would agree with you but solo q is not competitive solo q is like quick play queue in random and what you see is what you get no inention to talk and play at your best if you get that leaver and the troll on your team i dont think it should be based on the minority i simply say it is based on a minority which is why you and i dont climb up in ranks dont make it my fault i just say that it works fine for the minority i dont like it but this is the way it is
Overwatch,not_removed,yes the system is stupid but it is as it is only constant good players rank up average players remain around the same and others drop even further
Overwatch,not_removed,okay sure thats just the world we live in yo chill your tits dude doesnt matter how much you cry atm this is the world we live in deal with it ranked wont change tonight neither tomorrow or next week it is as it is either you accept it for now and hoping for good thatt hey change it for or not
Overwatch,not_removed,saying that solo q is not ranked is down right stupid i could be a damn good player but because im not playing with other people its not competitive its simple if your above average for your rank you should rank up over time and if your worse you will de rank eventually putting you in place till you get better however at the current time being slightly better or maybe more than slightly doesnt mean you rank up but you derank however as of now you can only rank up if you are in a stack significantly better than your rank if blizzard wants the majority of its fanbase to continue to play ow it will fix what the majority of its community wants fixed
Overwatch,not_removed,no average and even slightly above average players drop in rank too thats whats so damn stupid win rate is average if you have a win rate right now youll end up eventually demoting yourself in to oblivion even though you win as often as you lose
Overwatch,not_removed,i could be a damn good player but because im it playing with other people its not competitive its a team game saying i am a soccer star does not making a play in the park with strangers a competitive game just because you are ronaldo if you play a team game solo this is not competitive
Overwatch,not_removed,yeah its win and lose to remain your rank its stupid
Overwatch,not_removed,so playing csgo alone isnt competitive playing dota alone isnt competitive that logic is completely flawed you can play a team game by your self because your supposed to work with the strangers on your team to beat the other team you should not expect everyone to find people to play with
Overwatch,not_removed,so playing csgo alone isnt competitive yes playing mm solo q is not competitive clutch or kick is not competitive it is competitive if you queue with a full team knowing your strategy on cubble and tweaking it while you sit on mumble and later on checking your replay to see what you did wrong and how you can improve pushing a button that says competitive on does not mean that you are actually being competitive esl is competitive mlg is competitive fnatic luminosity envyus faze clg that is competitive playing solo from home yoloqueing to be randomly put into a game is not competitive quickplay would be a competitive gamemode as well with your logic as much as normal games in lol would be competitive and matches in csgo would be competitive obviously not ffa csgo cancermode but its not its an illusion a button that is called competitive yet it does the same like quick play playing a team game solo is not competitive it was discussed in csgo it was discussed in lol playing a team game solo is not competitive call it stupid call it flawed everything outside from esport and league systems is not competitive all competitive mode is is a different matchmaking algorithm that has more focus to let you play against people on your skillbracket sorry to burst the bubble it would be competitive if only yolo q would be an option so for everyone it would be equal and the focus would be on being a single good player but since you can be queued against a premade team this is not competitive its random queue gamemode
Overwatch,not_removed,wow those are really well done good job
Overwatch,not_removed,dad child nbsp the pumpkin looks like it took a lot more effort
Overwatch,not_removed,practice
Overwatch,not_removed,this isnt just at lower levels its up even in the higher tiers like platinum and diamond tiers people think this shit just goes away it doesnt speaking from experience here you can be as nice as possible but some people are too stubborn
Overwatch,not_removed,there is no difference in attitude it is purely based on mechanical skill you will find complete jerks at master and pleasant players at silver but the master jerk will be much better at shooting you in the head
Overwatch,not_removed,is lower level you sound extremely pompous and that sr is slightly below platinum it is definitely bad below the games between and feel similar to me
Overwatch,not_removed,why do you follow the meta so hard
Overwatch,not_removed,if youre unable to keep up on soloheals in low goldhigh silver as an almost plat then youre the trash not your team get good
Overwatch,not_removed,a lot of people talk about jerks being higher up and i get that and i ran into that but nothing is as bad as under i hovered for of this season at about and above playing with mostly diamond and i had very little issues with my own team i wont sit here and say i didnt at all but every other match in lower rank you get leavers trash talkers trolls and just down right rude players its hard to carry as heals alone i shouldnt be worried about making kills and if my team never doesim kinda up shit creak so how do i carry tanks at least have some damage behind them but im often forced into playing mercy or ana and sure i can pick with ana all dayor i can let my team die
Overwatch,not_removed,then play qp if you want to just have fun its kinda why they have it people are in comp to rank not to goof around or try new heros if you desperately wanna play widow but youre not that great maybe bring that over to qp there is no difference to that player but the rest of the team wont have to suffer i never understood this way of thinking one person is right over other players trying to play a decent comp game that one person should be allowed to have fun and do what ever they want at the expense of the teams fun and win rate
Overwatch,not_removed,it is definitely bad below actually there is a difference people below are way more chill than noskills in denial all the way from to high plat and thats why games are much more enjoyable if you dont have mechanical skill to go masters
Overwatch,not_removed,isnt low level i was shocked i reached that high on mostly solo ques for me personally is lower level which is what i sank to from
Overwatch,not_removed,when youre dps is trash its all you really can do my teams hardly ever do higher up
Overwatch,not_removed,i could keep up solo heals just fine in higher rank because my team was decent and made a kill at least once a round expecting your healer to carry a crap team then blaming it on the healer is some low tier garbage
Overwatch,not_removed,but that actually doesnt sounds bitchy at all people are too sensitive jeez you must be a dps main stuck in the with that attitude lol
Overwatch,not_removed,then play qp if you want to just have fun no i have paid for the game therefore i have the right to play it in any way allowed by tos find me one point there which says im not allowed to play widow or torbjorn or one that says that i must listen to some selfappointed igl of a yoloqueue band of randoms people are in comp to rank people are in comp to rank with any hero they want if youre not that great you will be ranked lower as simple as that if you desperately wanna play widow but youre not that great maybe bring that over to qp if you desperately wanna copy setups youve seen on twitch because you dont have skill to play around anything else or make a strat of your own then maybe or uninstall otherwise your lack of flexibility will get your rank to where you rightfully belong or more specifically to low tier games where people lacking skill in either raw gameplay mechanics strategy or teamwork belong theres no difference to you but people who are perfectly allowed to use any strategy they come up with wont have to suffer from listening to metaworshipping noskills like you one person is right over other players trying to play a decent comp game yes one person is right because there are no formal requirements to use any specific hero composition strategy or role balance if you dont you have no right to demand or even expect anyone to follow knnow about or even give a flying fuck about pro scene and surprise surprise most people dont give a fuck about pro scene that one person should be allowed to have fun and do what ever they want at the expense of the teams fun and win rate yes because that one person has also paid for the game dont like it or gtfo
Overwatch,not_removed,sorry i was tired when i wrote that i am not sure what i thought you said
Overwatch,not_removed,quick reminder you are low tier garbage right now if you werent youd be able to rank up and in my games if the dps cant keep up i switch to dps instead of bitching because bitching about peoples heroes wont make them any better thats something way beyond comprehension of metaknighting shits like you but in my games it just works no you dont need meta in gold you dont need composition either because at gold level a semicompetent team can win a game without a problem you are not better than your team either because youre literally the same rank therefore acting like a selfappointed igl will get you exactly nowhere have a problem with that
Overwatch,not_removed,one person cant ruin a team comp sounds like you havent encountered some of the mei players in comp who want to have fun
Overwatch,not_removed,waitsince when are there boring roles in this game
Overwatch,not_removed,sounds a lot like i wanna do what i wanna do and fuck everyone else cause its me time
Overwatch,not_removed,not a problem dude i can understand how it sounded rude on my end i fight gold and plat to be middle ground personally
Overwatch,not_removed,why do people think i hump the meta so hard is it just a thin excuse to find something to be mad at me about if my team is running into oncoming fire and cant play smart i cant heal alone if i switch to dps and i take gold that still dosnt remove the issue of my team liking to block bullets with their face again you do a lot of assuming a lot like of your whining is making up things i never said and trying to use that against me insulting me really wont get you very far but it seems to be your one trick pony if i call her bad enough maybe she will cry and leave
Overwatch,not_removed,i dont understand how typing out we need a second healer i cant heal alone is bitchyif you honestly believe it is i dont think im the one with social skills
Overwatch,not_removed,you having paid for the game and deciding to be a dick and not play your best in a comp round is allowed just know youre being a huge cuck about the whole thing and everyone is going to be pissed off at you no one said youre not allowed hell i never said your not allowed with any hero they want sure sounds like you think you level different with each character common sense says that if you want to rank you might wanna give it the ol college try not the eh fuck these people im not great at x hero lets just do that why do you assume i stick to meta my go to is yea okay lets see if this works before i start making suggestions to switch attack widow cool if you think you can do it im all for attack sym and play it often i give people chances youre doing a lot of assuming here buddy getting heated like i personally kicked your puppy and told you you were bad at the game no where in the sentence you quoted did i say anything about meta or not ever playing widow youre just so desprate for me to be the boogy man youll say just about anything to make me seem like an asshole noskills next youll say i was behind youre reaching so far you might pull something careful againwho the fuck is saying anything about this so called pro scene you keep carrying on about no one this whole threat is about how lower rank refuses to do basic team work and a good team comp never said it had to be meta never said anything about twitch or the pro scene these are all things you made up some heros work well together others do not its teamwork to talk to your team and figure these things out thats what im askingliterally nothing else but communication and a willingness to work wth ones group if things arnt going well the literal point of the game is switching heros to counter if youre not doing that you miss the point of the game and one person is not right if one person is right than im gonna go ahead and side with myself that works two ways im allowed to be annoyed at my team becasue im that one person outta five i decide just like you decided the one person throwing is allowed to do what they want butso did i and im not having fun so youre sticking up for me now cool you see how thats just one big fallacy youre whole argument can literally side with me as well outside of you being a childish asshole who makes up fantasy arguments to prove one person wrong for asking for teamwork in a team game youre argument is on some shaky ground to start but in the end rounded out to still siding with me regardless one person should be allowed to do what ever the hell they want since they bought the game i brought the game so i should be allowed to demand teamwork wopsie
Overwatch,not_removed,social skills can be judged on results how have your results been in getting the things you requested from other players
Overwatch,not_removed,im referring to the people who go into competitive and just troll their own team with mei holding their ults using ice walls to trap their team in the spawn or putting them up in doorways and hallways to split people up or say trap a person on the enemy side of said wall to be killed etc trolls are a pain in the ass in competitive but thats their version of having fun in general though its fine if people want to pay the game just to have fun but thats the reason why there is quickplay playing against ai and brawls there are three game modes in the game made for trying new things and messing around and having fun but competitive is there specifically for players who want to engage in more serious gameplay and it isnt the place for all of that
Overwatch,not_removed,i like to check the profiles of players i get queued with and from what ive seen in hours of gameplay its pretty much the opposite except for perhaps percent of hanzogenjijunkratroadhog mains who almost only play that char or other dps most people have at least two tanks supports within the most played heroes
Overwatch,not_removed,i would say so i originall mained tank with a bit of support every once in a while but its gotten to the point where i picked up dps because i had to play it so often the last part mainly because most of the friends i play with main tank and support but i often experienced a lack of dps players in solo q as well that is in ranked of course qp is a different experience
Overwatch,not_removed,this is the hanzo everyone wants on their team
Overwatch,not_removed,a highlight the potg that beat this must have been something or it was a bastion
Overwatch,not_removed,it looked like you punched mei out of her ice block
Overwatch,not_removed,i wish it was in a professional photoshoot it looks awesome
Overwatch,not_removed,id be too busy running away
Overwatch,not_removed,what the fuck were you doing on
Overwatch,not_removed,oh hey thats me dd greeting from hungary
Overwatch,not_removed,browsing stuff
Overwatch,not_removed,how tf did u even find it well if thats really you its cool dud
Overwatch,not_removed,i was google searching the picture from my deviantart and i found the link dd i have a short video of my stage performance at a hungarian convention if you interested d
Overwatch,not_removed,yes we need more mei murder clips whenever a mei diesa mercy gets her wingsto fly in and rez the team
Overwatch,not_removed,i was giggling the whole time i was running away the way the video ends is the cherry on top
Overwatch,not_removed,german engineering
Overwatch,not_removed,we are all genji now
Overwatch,not_removed,
Overwatch,not_removed,this makes me want a class that can trimp or do some advanced movement shit
Overwatch,not_removed,i would love to be able to climb walls as reinhardt i could die happily after seeing reinhardt climbing a wall like
Overwatch,not_removed,anas golden gun is gorgeous just throwing that out there
Overwatch,not_removed,spiderrein spiderrein friendly neighborhood spiderrein wealth and fame hes ignored justice done is his reward look out here comes the spiderrein
Overwatch,not_removed,precise german engineering
Overwatch,not_removed,all ive ever wanted is an offense character who can wallride its the most fun movement mechanic in the game and it would be awesome if you could use it to flank instead of just to survive and get to teammates
Overwatch,not_removed,it was a tossup between mercy considering her upcoming buffs and ana ultimately went with ana and quite happy with the decision
Overwatch,not_removed,rein approves
Overwatch,not_removed,precision german engineering
Overwatch,not_removed,wait theres blood when you hurt enemies
Overwatch,not_removed,the round was already over senseless tracisim
Overwatch,not_removed,cause of the junkrat mine it looks like your bouncing the pulse bomb back at tracer
Overwatch,not_removed,is dva gon hafta smack a bitch
Overwatch,not_removed,you mean when mccree has had enough of tracer right
Overwatch,not_removed,beautiful
Overwatch,not_removed,this is what i like to see
Overwatch,not_removed,httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvxvodrzuwjaq
Overwatch,not_removed,i let this loop about a dozen times still satisfying
Overwatch,not_removed,waitdva didnt get the kill a mccree shot her in the face watch the killfeed lol
Overwatch,not_removed,true justice
Overwatch,not_removed,pow right in the kisser
Overwatch,not_removed,idk how many up votes you have because of the update but i love this
Overwatch,not_removed,she fell like kids on rchildrenfallingover
Overwatch,not_removed,in other news that tracer was totally standing on the point and ot was not triggered lol
Overwatch,not_removed,falcon punch
Overwatch,not_removed,so this is what good framerate looks like
Overwatch,not_removed,tracers b like
Overwatch,not_removed,im a simple man
Overwatch,not_removed,this is the second most satisfying thing ive watched all day the first involved a similar clip involving tracer over at the rule subreddit
Overwatch,not_removed,not sure why but i find this really offensive
Overwatch,not_removed,wait do people actually think this is a quality post
Overwatch,not_removed,wasted
Overwatch,not_removed,looks badass
Overwatch,not_removed,girls fighting over guys
Overwatch,not_removed,whats your video recorder i also what to share some funny scenes with my friends
Overwatch,not_removed,bitch thats my spotlight
Overwatch,not_removed,that head smack did a lot of damage
Overwatch,not_removed,is there an arthur meme of dva i feel like i need that in my life
Overwatch,not_removed,that is immensely satisfying to watch
Overwatch,not_removed,did she say shenanigans
Overwatch,not_removed,pow right in the kisser
Overwatch,not_removed,pow right in the kisser
Overwatch,not_removed,so what ur trying to say is take someone on your own size
Overwatch,not_removed,never noticed the bomb throw animation from tracer is it supposed to be her chronal accelerator thing which when detached explodes
Overwatch,not_removed,i need to save this and watch it whenever i need to go to my antitracer happy place
Overwatch,not_removed,i hate when a person thinks theyre invincible as a tracer i main roadhog and i love watching a tracer zoom around me like i cant do shituntil i chain snatch that bitch
Overwatch,not_removed,didnt mcree kill her though
Overwatch,not_removed,that was incredibly satisfying
Overwatch,not_removed,right in the kisser tracer you skank
Overwatch,not_removed,i did the same thing to mei just now as pilot dva as nobody on my team countered her properly and of course shed been gleefully freezing me through my defense matrix all round this was highly satisfying
Overwatch,not_removed,hahahahah at least people focused the fucking opcancer glorious and that gremlin dva pistol whip hmmmmmm
Overwatch,not_removed,take that you feminist
Overwatch,not_removed,so on client side im pretty sure theres blood im saying this from my own perspective ive seen blood on my character from first person view but i never see blood when i hit the enemy back which is rather strange but i think thats because my father is much larger than me and when hes drunk he probably gets more damage resistance
Overwatch,not_removed,does it have anything to do with graphics quality like those bushes that people sometimes hide in
Overwatch,not_removed,im playing since beta and noticing this just now mind blown
Overwatch,not_removed,fun fact bastion spurts out oil whenever hit too
Overwatch,not_removed,how have i never noticed this
Overwatch,not_removed,the esrb rating for overwatch is t for teen because of blood tobacco use and violence so there is blood though you never notice it
Overwatch,not_removed,the blood disappears very quickly so you can only really notice it on koth after the round has ended
Overwatch,not_removed,i have noticed it before but only on slowed down melee kills like this i wonder if we would notice it it was removed
Overwatch,not_removed,thats what i was thinking i a goal once i get home hot for words must investigate
Overwatch,not_removed,on the super nintendo version its blue sweat
Overwatch,not_removed,tracer deserves it scouts deserved to be massacred and so do tracers
Overwatch,not_removed,why you guys gotta be tracist d why
Overwatch,not_removed,fuck tracer
Overwatch,not_removed,hahahahah no wonder i was seeing something really odd there i was like huh genji reflected
Overwatch,not_removed,yeah i know lol the timing was just perfect
Overwatch,not_removed,yeah noticed that myself i was wondering how a pistol whip did that much damage
Overwatch,not_removed,why does her on fire bar go to zero when the footage jumps
Overwatch,not_removed,i hate how the game gives you credit for kills you didnt get i used to think i was amazing at overwatch until i started looking at the kill feed when is blizzard going to fix this
Overwatch,not_removed,hitting tracer in the face made my day
Overwatch,not_removed,httpswwwredditcomrofcoursethatsathing
Overwatch,not_removed,what else is new
Overwatch,not_removed,i checked again she isnt on the point in time slow it down to and watch the overtime ends before she crosses the line into the point
Overwatch,not_removed,its quality because it involves killing cancer
Overwatch,not_removed,its pretty cool since its slomo at fps
Overwatch,not_removed,yes its very therapeutic
Overwatch,not_removed,someone always has to be that guy
Overwatch,not_removed,i just used shadowplay to record it its the most convenient
Overwatch,not_removed,you see her coming and as she passes your line of sight you hit the chain and its feels like this wonderful clothesline effect then kaboom night night
Overwatch,not_removed,yeah this tracer gave us hell in the first round didnt help my team was offence heroes but yeah this felt good too
Overwatch,not_removed,a sad routside
Overwatch,not_removed,shaku back at it again
Overwatch,not_removed,get back to ranimeirl you
Overwatch,not_removed,rjesuschristreddit
Overwatch,not_removed,goddamit who let shaku out of her cage
Overwatch,not_removed,i dont know but my graphics are cranked all the way and id never noticed it
Overwatch,not_removed,i can see it on low settings but its not really something you look for on dva up close to a road hog you can make his head look like a meatball
Overwatch,not_removed,holy shit
Overwatch,not_removed,so does dvas meka
Overwatch,not_removed,but is that a sign of damage or excitement
Overwatch,not_removed,lime tracer httpwikiteamliquidnetoverwatchfiletracerneongreenjpg
Overwatch,not_removed,laughs in french
Overwatch,not_removed,truck facer
Overwatch,not_removed,ill be sure to save a pulse bomb for your birthday present
Overwatch,not_removed,i was about to ask if melee attacks could headshot lol
Overwatch,not_removed,because the round is effectively over
Overwatch,not_removed,its a fantastic idea because then nobody whines about kill stealing
Overwatch,not_removed,i think it is how it is so that your whole team can rest easy knowing that they helped kill satan
Overwatch,not_removed,made my night
Overwatch,not_removed,
Overwatch,not_removed,theres still a delay even after you get on point i dropped onto the payload with pharah last night and was actually landed on it for maybe second but the match still ended in defeat
Overwatch,not_removed,out of all the characters who could be considered cancer its tracer now oo
Overwatch,not_removed,hes not being that guy its a very valid point its quite literally just meleeing a tracer one of the lowest effort submissions ive seen for a while
Overwatch,not_removed,thx your quick answer dude this is my first comment in reddit so this tool should open in background and record all timebecause i think your post is not in potg
Overwatch,not_removed,hes on a roll i was so blessed reading his feminine dick story
Overwatch,not_removed,porkball
Overwatch,not_removed,ive been told to chemo myself for playing tracer
Overwatch,not_removed,yes apparently a hero who is outclassed as a flanker by genji takes a lot of skill to be effective with insta dies to literally everyone and everything if the skill of the players is even as well as being on the weaker side of things in terms of balance in most situations shes the tumour of the game not torb forcing extremely slow paced and dull gameplay on both sides not genji being in every single game because weebs with over inflated egos not junkrat left clicking while barely aiming as he deletes squishies with his insta kill combo and sentences anyone to death that happened to get withing metres of his trap and somehow managed to end up inside not lucio or ana being too strong and dominating the support class not hanzo pressing e and instakilling anything thats not a tank with little counterplay not roadhog hooking miles to the left of you and still somehow dragging you in to his no no zone tracer is the cancer of the game
Overwatch,not_removed,all characters are cancer
Overwatch,not_removed,so just downvote and move on with your life
Overwatch,not_removed,roverwatch would be a very sad place if all we had were serious discussions on strategy dont get me wrong i love myself some good discussion and some good potgs but i also love myself some tracer bitch slapping and mei bitch slapping to start the day off on a good note to each his own i guess
Overwatch,not_removed,its an nvidia thing if you have an nvidia card it should be there in geforce experience you can set it up to record a certain amount in the past like i have it set to record mins and everytime i press alt it records the last mins
Overwatch,not_removed,wow i suppose id get that if i could actually aim im a good tracer but i cant aim for shit
Overwatch,not_removed,no one said that tracer is the only cancer
Overwatch,not_removed,yeah i have man but you commented as though you couldnt see what the dudes issue with the post was so i was just explaining it for you
Overwatch,not_removed,oh thats great thank you
Overwatch,not_removed,yeah once you start improving your aim get ready for plenty of salty messages chemo yourself i hope you get hit by a truck drink bleach ect bunch of salty tracists
Overwatch,not_removed,well thank you have a good day
Overwatch,not_removed,the ow servers and the madden servers are down im about to just say fuck it and play a board game

Overwatch,not_removed,oh boi i can imagine the rage luckily i got kicked out of the game soon as a dva ulted
Overwatch,not_removed,if you hear angry japanese run
Overwatch,not_removed,start playing competitive when you think youre ready learn the heroes find the ones that are important and needed and learn with them use quick play andor arcade andor upcoming server browser and extended custom games features andor practice range to learn with heroes and what they do theres always a hero or heroes you play as the most so youre basically maining some heroes but thats not what you should do and if its required you should change and be able to change meaning that you should be familiar with the heroes no healer be healer and know what to do no tank be tank and know what to do the team has all the important heroes just pick whoever you feel familiar with the most or try to experiment dont play the same hero over and over and over again no matter what change if its needed yes it is not every hero can land a headshot but most heroes can headshot is double the damage
Overwatch,not_removed,if you want to play it then you should like the name says is competitive way more serious than qp or arcade and personally my favorite mode and its more challenging in my opinion you should at least main or know how to use one hero per class in competitive for example you wont be able to play the hero you want on every match qp or no limits its a good place to train yeah its a thing damn you hanzo personally just from watching some pro videos you can learn a few things dont know a specific yt channel sorry
Overwatch,not_removed,ranked id just look at giving it a go once you feel confident in the game play some quickplay for a while when you feel happy with how you play then jump to competitive may be an idea not to go to competitive too early as lower placements now may make it harder to get higher placements in future seasons not sure how all that works herosmains up to you but i prefer to try and at least have a little understanding of most heroes lots of people main one hero but really you should at least have a couple heroes that you consider your main team composition matters and its better if you can easily slide into another role if someone already has picked your preferred hero so i would recommend having at least a couple character you consider mains its especially useful if you find at least one healer and one tank you can get comfy with should you need to take up one of them for a match also sometimes a team comp just isnt working for that match or someone is countering you well dont be afraid to switch midmatch if you feel its a better option having that freedom is good headshots yes double damage for certiain attacks with certain heroes but not everyone for everything see here for more info not sure how up to date it is tho httpswwwfuriouspaulcomoverwatchbasicsheadshotshtml video guides good idea someone else may be better able to recommend a specific one though id just be jumping into youtube watching random things to i find stuff i like in this department
Overwatch,not_removed,play comp whenever you want theyre referred to as heroes and you usually try to main at least hero from each category so that you can fill any open gaps in a team composition for example my main offensive character is soldier my main defensive character is hanzo my main tank is dva i play her the most and my main support is lucio or mercy you can headshot with every hero except reinhardt winston zarya symmetra junkrat pharah and bastion in his turret form after this upcoming patch youll get a red light on your crosshair if you hit an opponent in the head you seem to be on top of it when it comes to videos i know that unit lost has a series called where they take viewer submitted videos and critique them which could help you gain more knowledge hope you have fun with your career in ow edit also dont listen to wondervictim hes just giving you troll advice genji hanzo widow sombra bastion torbjorn and symmetra are all great characters when used right genji hanzo and widow are high skill characters so they need some practice to be good at sombra is perfectly fine and bastion symmetra and torb are awesome on defense and sometimes great on attack if you are trying to push a payload
Overwatch,not_removed,start whenever you feel ready a lot of people say is too low to really be able to play comp well since most people still havent really figured out how the game works at that leveland i sort of agree but if you wanna try and get a feel for how comp works and you dont really care about your ranking i say go for it i highly recommend being able to play more than one therell always be one thats your favorite and you like to play more but being able to play a variety of heroes at least reasonable well helps so much that way if someone takes your first pick youre not completely useless to your team and youll have some options to switch to if you need to counter a specific hero on the other team hour on each is a great start and personally ive made it my goal to have at least in each category that i can play headshots are a thing yes i believe a headshot is double the damage of a normal shot a list of shit ive compiled for other peoplesorry to dump so much information on you ow resources roverwatchuniversity has a whole page with some pretty good httpswwwredditcomroverwatchuniversitywikiguides and things httpswwwoverbuffcom and httpmasteroverwatchcom are both great for checking stats check out httpswwwoverbuffcomblog on overbuff too he posts some awesomely detailed reports ive been told has some good starter guides but i havent had the chance to watch them yet so im not sure how accurate or helpful they are id personally recommend staying away from channels such as unit lost or your overwatch they arent really the most helpful and on a few occasions just spread misinformation competitive ow resources httpwwwgosugamersnetoverwatchvods has a pretty big collection of competitive vods and a list of upcoming events and httpswwwyoutubecomchannelucleoslbscttqisjfbknkw posts vods from most of the larger tournaments has some great highlight matches from pros and streams posts highlights and things from pro players keep an eye on the sidebar for rcompetitiveoverwatch too theyre usually pretty good about posting new tournaments personally i learn best from watching other people play so heres a few pro players i can think of off the top of my head that you might wanna check out seagull httpswwwtwitchtvaseagull kephrii httpswwwtwitchtvkephrii harbleu httpswwwtwitchtvharbleu taimou httpswwwtwitchtvtaimoutv reaver httpswwwtwitchtvtehreavervideosall grego httpswwwtwitchtvgregomyeggolive surefour httpswwwtwitchtvsurefour harryhook httpswwwtwitchtvharryhook chipshajen httpswwwtwitchtvchipshajen lassiz httpswwwtwitchtvlassiz iddqd httpswwwtwitchtviddqdow calvin httpswwwtwitchtvaimbotcalvin a couple miscellaneous channels that i personally enjoy they tend to be more humorous which might not be what youre looking for or they dont always stream overwatch but definitely still some awesome players moon httpswwwtwitchtvmoonmoonow tim thetatman httpswwwtwitchtvtimthetatman dspstanky httpswwwtwitchtvdspstanky straight up memes most of the time but i feel theyre still worth mentioning considering their popularity zylbrad this isnt a complete list by any means just whatever i could think of without too much searching around sorry for dumping all this on you but hopefully something here helps
Overwatch,not_removed,thx guys for the answers so i guess i m gng to give a try to ranked after played heres done and see where it leads me
Overwatch,not_removed,you should play competitive when you think you are able to properly communicate with your team if you have a mic you should always warm up and get a few wins in quick play before you join comp i personally recommend that you learn how to use at least one hero from each category they dont have to be your main but you should be able to play other heroes should your main be taken by someone else who mains that hero yes headshots do work in this game the only people who cannot headshot are any heroes that use beam weapons like winston zarya symmetra and also anna the youtube channels i watch are your overwatch and unit lost i highly recommend unit lost since he has a series called over analysed where he goes over gameplay footage and says what should and shouldnt be done
Overwatch,not_removed,never be around the payload the meta always is hanzogenjiwidowsombratorbjorn or bastion and symmetra instalocking hanzo fucking kill yourself instalocking genji choke on my lijang tower spam i need healing with genji for extra xp
Overwatch,not_removed,this is also a good tip unless that angry japanese sounds a little gruff then just sidestep a little
Overwatch,not_removed,you cant headshot with ana too just tought ill add it since you forgot
Overwatch,not_removed,should also mention that for if you dont have a mic make sure your using the communication shortcuts to let people know how much ult you have you need healing group up ext
Overwatch,not_removed,well i understood that genji looks like a yasuo on lol and like there i am bad with him so i wont be a instalock genji as for hanzo i dont really try him but for the few i did i was just horrible meta is it really a thing i heard about tank dd and supports or the genji meta but is it really a thing
Overwatch,not_removed,oh yeah totally forgot about her
Overwatch,not_removed,hes trolling you poorly
Overwatch,not_removed,what kalranya said but there is a meta its recommended that you have at least one healer and one tank on your team but you shouldnt have to worry about it too much at a lower level
Overwatch,not_removed,yeah that sums it up doing nothing special but when youre a low health mercy v full health roadhog whos just hooked you that spices things up lol
Overwatch,not_removed,yep pretty much the whole other redditors have those spicy videosgifs covered just wanted to try making a chill video with what i had thanks for watching
Overwatch,not_removed,the ± in points are not static values and are determined on a gamebygame basis
Overwatch,not_removed,shitty yeti winston bruh
Overwatch,not_removed,the winston yeti skin is boss and arguably the most popular one of them all
Overwatch,not_removed,dude if boxes doesnt give you enough gold for torb and zenyatta ill eat my shoe
Overwatch,not_removed,why are you a baby
Overwatch,not_removed,why are you salty and does this post count as a rant that contributes nothing
Overwatch,not_removed,who cares
Overwatch,not_removed,its a barely passable skin there is nothing great about it does not look good is not great design no animations or detail
Overwatch,not_removed,santa torb is the best skin for him period santa mei has the best animations nut zenyatta has the best design yeti winston is just whatever you wanna swap id gladly trade for santa torb fuck man i should have just bought games on steam with that money fuck these rng purchase systems its just funny how worthless the drops were i cant even fucking buy a skin with the miserable amounts of gold i got
Overwatch,not_removed,because i paid good money and got trash feels bad
Overwatch,not_removed,i dont think ive ever seen a more wrong opinion on this sub
Overwatch,not_removed,santa torb is his best skin yeah but its still not too crazy meis is lame she always wears big fluffy coats now its just red and her ice block has a snow man head on top i do love me some nutcracker but winstons is pretty great too the reason those two are great is because its not just a recolor they actually changed the whole model up melikey but yeah you definitely should have just bought games with that money sorry dood skins are fun but ive gotten nearly everything i want in overwatch for free it just takes some time and even then theyre not worth much if you could trade them like in maybe
Overwatch,not_removed,i hate rng as much as the next person but your opinion on yeti winston is offensively bad meis winter skin is mainly a recolor of her classic skin torbs santa is alright but practical and zens is cool but somewhat odd yeti winston is indeed well made his weapon looks like a chainsaw cmon
Overwatch,not_removed,thats exactly what they want you dont get the skin you want so you throw more money at them trust me ive done the same thing and regretted it
Overwatch,not_removed,thanks for your words yup i also like to just unlock things for free i mean i do have patience to hope for next year put convincing myself to just treat myself once and then getting really disappointed feels awful im just pissed about the legendary gold drops and legendary zarya emotes and regular legendary skins gold instead of it feels fucking awful
Overwatch,not_removed,i just didnt care for the winston or tracer skins i just hoped for one of the other three or enough gold to buy them instead i only got gold drops and gold drops from duplicate zarya emotes
Overwatch,not_removed,that sucks that you didnt get what you were hoping for i just think its kinda funny how you really wanted an unpopular skin that actually angered people meis and you hated on one of the most well received ones winstons everyone has a preference i guess no matter how strange
Overwatch,not_removed,i wish there was a way to slip blizzard some money for them to reset the boxes i got
Overwatch,not_removed,if you have spare money to slip them maybe buy some more loot boxes either that or level up as quick as possible in quickplay all depends on how much youre willing to spend or how much time you have to level up i believe you have about more days
Overwatch,not_removed,yeah i was making a joke blizzard doesnt want me to celebrate new years tonights qq
Overwatch,not_removed,always looks the same
Overwatch,not_removed,the reaper would be vaping
Overwatch,not_removed,you and every other reaper
Overwatch,not_removed,hours on an account i have hours on mercy alone but seriously though some people just have a lot of free time i guess more than one account makes sense for some people i follow someone on twitch who has a main account for her team games and a second account for her solo que games but unless gaming is in someway your job i dont understand why youd need more than one
Overwatch,not_removed,working as intended
Overwatch,not_removed,yes i get what youre saying it does get pretty annoying
Overwatch,not_removed,what sucks is i have gotten nut cracker zen like times
Overwatch,not_removed,i know its intended but its not very pleasing during happy times of holidays t
Overwatch,not_removed,thank you i mean its great that at least one item has to be holiday one i dont even mind spending real money on boxes either i purchase each event in case if someone thinks i just want free stuff easy way but its just irritating to finally see the legendary icon then it is duplicate and its not even enough for a damn event victory pose
Overwatch,not_removed,i wish i had nutcracker zen i get nothing but torbs and piles of gold
Overwatch,not_removed,ugh i can imagine me and my friend kept getting nothing but yeti winston lol hes cursed for us
Overwatch,not_removed,ive gotten tons of lootvooxes without a single winter item ive gone through well over boxes since the event started to boot just wanted to throw that out here
Overwatch,not_removed,i would give you extras if u could xd
Overwatch,not_removed,yeah it bites i only need to get the tracer skin to complete the holiday skins heres hoping i can manage to get it
Overwatch,not_removed,aww really i thought there was some rule for event boxes with chance for one item to be the event one maybe you need to contact blizzard this seems like quite a big issue
Overwatch,not_removed,i hope you can do it and that blizzard really looks into the coin drop off duplicates for the next event s
Overwatch,not_removed,yeah it could be much higher or at least make it so that you cant get a duplicate of a cost skin
Overwatch,not_removed,new meta heal symmetra to hell and back
Overwatch,not_removed,indeed
Overwatch,not_removed,this is how hanzo should be played hes not a sniper i think they should increase his rate of fire to compensate the hitbox change hes in a pretty poor place atm if you could draw the bow a bit faster these moves would be easier to pull off
Overwatch,not_removed,yeah i agree although not his firerate but the rate at which the arrow charges currently its maybe is better in this game every millisecond counts i also would really like them to change the time it takes for the climb to finish so you can fire again because you want to do the climb and fire arrow combo but it takes a bit before you can even draw the string back after youve finished climbing
Overwatch,not_removed,as a frequent mercy player up until the recent patch i just thought dying was part of her ult
Overwatch,not_removed,i am also in agreement i also believe maybe they should make hanzo a teensy bit fast not genji or tracer speeds but slightly faster than the other heroes i mean cmon the man is sprinting
Overwatch,not_removed,if you increase his fire rate it decreases the time it takes him to draw an arrow also it would increase his dps hes currently very low dps like sub torbjorn and mei he needs to do about dps
Overwatch,not_removed,battlenet
Overwatch,not_removed,i think you mean httpsblizztrackcom site
Overwatch,not_removed,i thought it is something like bliztracker but when i goggle it only ow trackers come
Overwatch,not_removed,pornhub ooops wrong one fly away
Overwatch,not_removed,nah an other and bot powered site which tracks updates
Overwatch,not_removed,like i said in another comment i think you mean httpsblizztrackcom site
Overwatch,not_removed,people are wanks quick play should definitely be goofland now that comp is out
Overwatch,not_removed,first of all attack hanzo is good second of all what you pick in quickplay is really no ones business
Overwatch,not_removed,nice loop
Overwatch,not_removed,beware mercys pistol thats all you need to know
Overwatch,not_removed,audio cues are a big part of the game learn them
Overwatch,not_removed,dont underestimate anyone based on the character they chose to play unless they choose to play bastion on defence when they solo q learn to strafe use the training ground its extraordinarily useful for characters that require pinpoint aim like mccree hanzo and widow learn all the characters names their kits and what they can do with their kits when synergized with other characters this will give you a better idea of what the enemy might be planning but more importantly it allows you to choose a good team comp that works well the game starts at character selection dont forget that you need good tanks healers as well as damage lack of damage will keep you from getting anywhere but so will lack of tanks and healers communicate with your team
Overwatch,not_removed,the worst thing you can do in overwatch is staggering your deaths and poor positioningthe two are directly related from the first match you play try to be aware of your positioning relative to the game flow and always be concious of the offensivedefensive line that youre holdingpushingyoure positioning varies from character to character so always be in the right spot and dont get caught in bad spots by thinking preemptively about where you should be fall back when youve lost fightsif youre starting to push in and you lose two right awayalways be watching the kill feedwait until youre grouped up in a full six againif they have hanzowidow dont peak to gain ultjust waitgetting picked off as half your team is about to group up is a huge losssimlarily if youre defending and two of your teamates die because theyre playing too far forward pull back and give the enemy team some space trying to take team fights as a or vs is literally the main reason people get stuck in low ranksthe time starts to tick down on map and people think oh shitwe have to take this so for the last two minutes they push in in groups of three not understanding that while theyre going to to get to the point quicker their odds of winning the team fight are drastically reduced
Overwatch,not_removed,my tips would be this isnt call of duty work together for christ sake its not about the kills its about the teamplay and completing the objective this is not call of duty dont run off and trickle group up and storm in numbers this isnt call of duty no one cares how many medals you got for kills if our team lost this isnt call of duty also turns out this game isnt call of duty but in all honesty get used to a few heroes from different classes work together group up where you can and if you lose dont go on a salt rage at everyone else motivate the team offer tips and learn from your own mistakes
Overwatch,not_removed,change your operating system mouse settings so you aim more consistently watch videos how to nbsp dont let toxic people ruin your day just mute and report nbsp go into custom games with the settings of headshotsonly active and hardmode ana ai to practice headshots with all characters that can do headshots nbsp try to find keep cool good players as friends to play with nbsp you will lose games dont stress about it nbsp learn to wait for team even when they wont wait for you play as a team this is not a carrysolo game nbsp dont be shy call out things over teamchatvoice for your team it helps everyone play together and betters your chances of winning nbsp go into settings change them accordingly change reticle to a yellow dot with bloom active turn on allied health bars set keybinds for emotecommunicationmeleeattack turn on auto join for team voice chat set group voice chat to on so you auto join team chat to call out things even while in a group buy surround sound headset audio cues are one of the biggest things in this game higher quality the better nbsp practice at least two different characters from each category role for competitive dont forget to change heroes if you need to
Overwatch,not_removed,my tip would be to git gud with zarya and roadhog soldier reaper and a healer zenyatta mercy lucio or ana these heroes are viable to the current team comp they are in the games meta and will be for a while most of all get those medals and team votes at the end of the match because they mean something just kidding they dont do anything but getting a gold eliminations medal means u got the most kills on your team
Overwatch,not_removed,most important things have been stated just to review regroup and v dont try heroics and get picked off audio cues are important step right up is great while its high noon means run for your fucking life and team composition is literally of the game you can be the best genji in the world shadowburn and be unable to carry an entire team of the time you should have healers while dpstank can flex but usually or healers tanks dps so yea learn in each role also be aware of ultimate economy to put it simply think about the ults that you have and how to combo them zaryas ult with tracer commonly reffered to as the big bang can take our most of the enemy team once it has happened there is no need to waste more to take out the few stragglers some great combos are ana nano boost soldier tac visor genji dragonblade winston zarya graviton dva bomb tracer bomb mccrees high noonspecially if they have a zenyatta pharahs barrage roadhogs wholehog mei freeze hanzo dragon reinhart hammer down with dva bomb when the dva bomb is thrown ideally behind the enemies rein and they have to turn around to block it hammer down and team wipe eventually youll learn some more but those are the most common ps you can be the best tracer in the game but if youre getting countered for the love of god switch there is a reason the game allows you to switch
Overwatch,not_removed,give up destiny sooner
Overwatch,not_removed,ive only played ow twice so far since were too poor to buy the game the only time me and my girlfriend played it was during the free weekends on release and now we are so into the game since the first time we played that by the second time we already knew all the basics and even more for some reason blizzard reset our accounts that we had leveled up to on the first free weekend and we had to start from level i dont mind leveling but my girl got ifrit zen from a box at like level and we had a lot of legendary skins and the early levels were an absolute stomp i would literally as soldier
Overwatch,not_removed,i dont mind it that much i am however fairly certain that the drop rate on skins was much higher on release so they would draw more people into buying the game i only remember that she had the ifrit zen skin i had a legendary for mccree hanzo pharah and one more i cant recall and a bunch of cheaper ones and thats only up to level however during this free week the skin drops have been more scarce but i was lucky enough to get a lot of gold
Overwatch,not_removed,the contents and type of lootboxes are determined the second you get them so no unfortunately
Overwatch,not_removed,the items are locked in the moment you level up and get the loot box
Overwatch,not_removed,nope the boxes are determined when you receive it not when you open it
Overwatch,not_removed,there is no reason to save them unless you want to open a ton at the same time theyre determined when you get them
Overwatch,not_removed,no
Overwatch,not_removed,thanks everyone for the information i am currently at loot boxes i kind of want to see how many i can collect at this point i have pretty much all the skins i want so no real incentive to open
Overwatch,not_removed,it says video not found for me
Overwatch,not_removed,sorry new link httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvymvqxdsuhde
Overwatch,not_removed,httpyoutubeymvqxdsuhde for a price in gaming views since oct httpwwwredditcomryoutubefactsbotwikiindex
Overwatch,not_removed,now i get why every one was picking the same hero today
Overwatch,not_removed,welcome to the ddos say hi to sombra
Overwatch,not_removed,the idea that you should be rewarded for playing a game for minutes is questionable
Overwatch,not_removed,forcing you to leave thats not how it works its the same ddos that made other people leave that got you
Overwatch,not_removed,so you are playing the game only because you are getting rewarded what if there were no levels no lootboxes the game is exactly the same with or without levelscosmetic stuff
Overwatch,not_removed,i get rewarded for matches
Overwatch,not_removed,it did force me to leave reinstancing or whatever it does to req you with other players since the current game has lost i have fine connection
Overwatch,not_removed,i never said i didnt enjoy it on its own cosmetics dont mean much to me i havent even opened a single crate i just like to have my efforts rewarded sometimes its like when you hear people say thanks for healing its nice to hear
Overwatch,not_removed,why are you being so toxic it doesnt shay anywhere in game that its ddos im not playing comp nor did i mention anything in a comp manor get off your high horse and speak like a decent human being
Overwatch,not_removed,thats not so much a reward as an apology
Overwatch,not_removed,blizzard launcher says that they are being ddosed
Overwatch,not_removed,you the bothered to come to reddit and moan but didnt think to check a single recent thread i dont know why youd care about quick playbrawl xp so much my bad there nice buzzword tho its funny how pissy you got over one word
Overwatch,not_removed,it is a reward of you won that match in that much time and even the other team gets xp
Overwatch,not_removed,cheers didnt see it in game or on front page of reddit though so didnt know i only use launcher to well launch
Overwatch,not_removed,i didnt know it was a technical issue people leave so i get stung for mins of gameplay is pretty lame so why would i check to see if it was a technical issue when its an in built feature that i find annoying it doesnt matter which game mode it is some people might just play for brawl doesnt make their enjoyment less important and which buzz word were you talking about the post i responded to has been deleted also when did i show any signs of being pissed i didnt you dont have to be pissed to tell someone to not be a dick on the internet
Overwatch,not_removed,low effort humor
Overwatch,not_removed,no ana either
Overwatch,not_removed,dont assume zaryas gender she identifies as a hover truck because when she hits you thats what it feels like
Overwatch,not_removed,did you just assume zaryas gender
Overwatch,not_removed,manchester man chester man triggered
Overwatch,not_removed,nah thats some top tier shit right there man
Overwatch,not_removed,dont focus on elo focus on yourself and how to improve gm will come
Overwatch,not_removed,positioning on defense grouping up on offense
Overwatch,not_removed,lol im the exact same season i somehow pushed to master on xbox im just gonna focus on heroes to play at gm level solo or duo queue is optimum
Overwatch,not_removed,you cant stick to heroes on gm you can but it wont work all the time because you need to counter this otp top that is carrying the enemy team
Overwatch,not_removed,holy crap i met that guy in a lobby before and he even advertised his channel on mine hes a dick report him if you see him hes toxic
Overwatch,not_removed,this honestly just seems more bad on him as a person you have to be really sad if your idea of fun is having to ruin things for others reads as having other problems still report the youtube and ign to blizzard enough and theyll pay attention
Overwatch,not_removed,sure report it and hope for the best posting his channel though so he can get more views is simply feeding into him
Overwatch,not_removed,dont want to give the guy clicksviews in case it is as toxic as op says tldw
Overwatch,not_removed,on pc this can get you suspended not so much for console
Overwatch,not_removed,seems to play the game all day just to ruin it for others sad
Overwatch,not_removed,rip ucrvnchhh
Overwatch,not_removed,oh thats just mean
Overwatch,not_removed,punch the witnesses of your failure into the grave
Overwatch,not_removed,i love all the cancelled reload attempts in between each punch
Overwatch,not_removed,judging from all the mchanzo smut ive seen so far id confirm this is a legit strategy
Overwatch,not_removed,i just realized how much that yellow hanzo skin resembles mccrees vigilante one
Overwatch,not_removed,or you could have rolled to reload and fthd again
Overwatch,not_removed,dang it i couldve named this mccree fists hanzo to death
Overwatch,not_removed,i mean shit u right my way was more fun though
Overwatch,not_removed,is it bad that i am aroused right now
Overwatch,not_removed,vsync locks the fps to the refresh rate of your monitor if it was locking it to your monitor is hz which means any fps above is completely wasted
Overwatch,not_removed,no shit sherlock
Overwatch,not_removed,its not thats literally what vsync does limit your fps thats all it does how can it be more obvious
Overwatch,not_removed,ultimate abilities would be crazy lucio sound barrier to prevent a knockback woah so crazy dude
Overwatch,not_removed,seems broken af
Overwatch,not_removed,no i wish they had a straight slayer style gameplay with character of your choosing
Overwatch,not_removed,whoops i uploaded an outdated one rofl i replaced that with something else
Overwatch,not_removed,why would you be unable to unbox stuff you already have
Overwatch,not_removed,you would not be you can still open them later you just cannot get more boxes
Overwatch,not_removed,ops wording just threw me off
Overwatch,not_removed,his wording completely means what you thought he is simply wrong
Overwatch,not_removed,what i meant was you cant buy more loot boxes and you cant buy halloween items
Overwatch,not_removed,httpwwwdictionarycombrowseunbox
Overwatch,not_removed,its a control map so its like nepal
Overwatch,not_removed,an out of bounds map tour if you ever are curious heres an actual map tour i hope this is what you were lookn for
Overwatch,not_removed,shes fine learn to aim
Overwatch,not_removed,because shots kill
Overwatch,not_removed,
Overwatch,not_removed,thanks will use on my next couple of matches
Overwatch,not_removed,remember to do when no one is watching so you can avoid reports s
Overwatch,not_removed,i mean if you pull it off congrats but be wary that blizzard does ban for exploiting bugs
Overwatch,not_removed,rip
Overwatch,not_removed,use next time
Overwatch,not_removed,about a year late
Overwatch,not_removed,quality shitpost mate
Overwatch,not_removed,symmetra and her annoying primary mei and her annoying primary
Overwatch,not_removed,junkrat because lol who needs to aim have skill symmetra because you cant escape give up there is no hope
Overwatch,not_removed,symmetra w extra shield torb armor and her beam fully charged from just killing your tank
Overwatch,not_removed,symmetra that damn photon projector buff my team never looking behind and they wonder how their healer died to the flanker
Overwatch,not_removed,i roll my eyes at his snide little chuckle after a hook kill or two only wen shes sneaky while i push the payload i can accept getting outgunned by her now and then but i forget to look behind me for seconds and bam
Overwatch,not_removed,start with character bios here httpsplayoverwatchcomenusheroes
Overwatch,not_removed,httpsplayoverwatchcomenusheroes httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvzpizuanupru
Overwatch,not_removed,the ow youtube channel with the cinematic trailers and the origin stories the ow website with the comics the character interactions during matches thats it thats all the lore ow has very little lore to work with
Overwatch,not_removed,its sort of all over the place there are the cinematic and story trailers which can be found on youtube look for a channel called playoverwatch the comics which can be found a bunch of places but the easiest is on the main overwatch site media comics the character dossiers also on the main site the overwatch official and micheal chus personal twitter accounts often have lore and story tidbits strewn throughout them and of course the game itself a lot of the locations tell stories through their detail and often the heroes have voice lines and interactions that drop hints about their lore and backstory
Overwatch,not_removed,if you want to keep track of the most current information and how it relates to past overwatch lore unit lost isnt a bad channel
Overwatch,not_removed,you could check out hammeh on youtube his content mostly contains overwatch lore with some speculations involving the subject you can always refer first to the original media sources comics cinematics etc as stated by everyone else here before watching his videos
Overwatch,not_removed,i have a fiction reading guide here just go down the list in order and youll get a good sense of the ongoing story currently not updated with the new efi stuff but it will be soon
Overwatch,not_removed,is there an overwatch forum that is involved with the lore i saw something that mentioned how there was an interview with efi that was posted on a forum before the big tweet today
Overwatch,not_removed,that interview was posted to the news section of the overwatch site and linked by the official twitter
Overwatch,not_removed,sometimes i imagine a splinter cell blacklist spy vs merc game type three points only one of them can be active at a time maybe some additional gimmicks but i also know this is pretty hard to balance
Overwatch,not_removed,only during the halloween events
Overwatch,not_removed,during the event
Overwatch,not_removed,no get what you need todaytomorrow
Overwatch,not_removed,no you wont i got placed in bronze and my when i did helped my friend with his placements he got gold
Overwatch,not_removed,also since i was silver at the time we just got matches against non ranked so
Overwatch,not_removed,it will calculate an average and put you and your friend at that leve even if you dont have a rank you do have an mmr that the game works with to find matches for you
Overwatch,not_removed,it doesnt matter only because me and my friends were unranked and we finally decided to play ranked and the first match we were put with an all diamond team
Overwatch,not_removed,it doesnt make sense to wait until lvl youll get better at the game faster in comp rather than quick play thats how i went from low plat to masters in one season focus on one hero in comp and you will learn the game
Overwatch,not_removed,as long as its not mercy or a troll pick
Overwatch,not_removed,you know how words make sense together when you put them in the right order well it turns out that when you just string them together randomly they dont make any sense at all i know shocked me too
Overwatch,not_removed,allow me to correct my wording get the fuck in there group up and die
Overwatch,not_removed,mercys pistol does a surprising amount of damage
Overwatch,not_removed,i just need my huge res achievement please team
Overwatch,not_removed,this idea promotes poor gameplay
Overwatch,not_removed,mercy main btw
Overwatch,not_removed,i found the reaper in disguise
Overwatch,not_removed,so the discussion here is i want my team to die for a rez
Overwatch,not_removed,go in go nuts likely kill two or three enemies die get rezed kill the rest or force the rest to retreat for healing sounds like a good strategy to me better than being a sniper on offense
Overwatch,not_removed,no if your mercy has rez the best thing you can do is die together on point while forcing as many enemy ults as possible poor ganeplay is staggering deaths or dying far away from each other
Overwatch,not_removed,a perfect enemy reaper ult would be amazing for my rez
Overwatch,not_removed,snipers are more viable on offense actually at least on first point due to spawn advantage
Overwatch,not_removed,hahaha that was such a dirty tactic i bet he thought he was going to get you too
Overwatch,not_removed,high skill cap great anas can make a team and bad anas can destroy one same with genji youre playing high risk high reward ana has no mobility options her only form of escape is her sleep dart which is also used primarily for cc shes much better now that the damage nerf has taken place i dont see why youd quit over her
Overwatch,not_removed,you could always try console mate sure nobody talks in team chat but mercy is in practically every game its really fun watching the ults you poured into a point b push get undone cuz mercy was hiding in the corner watching her friends die like a sociopath im not too salty though im generally my teams mercy player
Overwatch,not_removed,anas sleep dart is more balanced than you think slept characters wake up at the slightest damage and it has a really long cooldown making it extremely important to coordinate the sleep with your team so it isnt wasted and if ana misses it then she has no escape option in a team fight take note of when the red ana has sleep on cooldown and take advantage of it or just focus her to prevent her from healing her team
Overwatch,not_removed,that can be said for any heroes a good player will always outplay a bad one i dont think ana is that risky at all it isnt very hard to hit a hero with a sleep dart unless they have a tiny hitbox and ridiculous mobility like genji and tracer her ability to heal from so far away makes it even less risky unlike heroes like mercy where the only escape she has is hoping a teammate is far enough away to fly to and im all for high skill heroes but when you really only have one in a role with other subpar healers it gets so stale i will join in a match and people automatically are demanding ana and reinhardt but nobody wants to play that role because everyone claims to have played one or the other in of their matches today or something like that when an entire team of is arguing on who shouldnt play the healer with the most potential then it is pretty bad
Overwatch,not_removed,that shit happens on pc every once and a while too but the only time ive seen a mercy be as effective as an ana is when she pockets a pharah lately
Overwatch,not_removed,why use ult tbh its worse when you get that four man rez cause the enemy team combined two ults only for them to use two more ults to cancel out your rez
Overwatch,not_removed,sure it can be negated by damage but an ana with a mic can call out to not damage this hero in this area and get a huge potential out of it even if the hero is damaged right away it is pretty much almost the time equivalent of mccrees flashbang which both stun a hero enough to have you andor another teammate give huge amounts of damage and she may be slow but if she is in a fight with teammates around she can just jump around healing and damaging while biotic grenading herself to live for quite a long time
Overwatch,not_removed,depends there are easy to use heroes who still yield high results sleep dart takes getting used to its her only method of antiflanker and yes genji and tracer are basically the most utilised flankers in the game right now at mastergm if you miss your dart youre done mercy has a super high pick rate this meta most of the supports in the top have mercy over ana there is much less technical skill when using mercy lets be honest shes not a must pick honestly if your ana isnt landing her shots at least around the mark then she should be playing mercy what i dislike is when people demand an ana and you get someone whos like sure ill try her and expect to do well they finish with like accuracy and they lose shes a high skill hero with a lot of room for error with mercy you dont even have to be looking at the person you heal so you have the option to be shot calling and call out flankerspositioning i disagree with your comment about the other healers being subpar lucio has one of the highest pick rates in game his speed boost and aoe healing is fantastic zen is great for melting people and keeping your dps heroes alive the only exception from this rule may be mercy shes a little underwhelming to play but thats because shes a little twodimensional you ping pong about and when the fight gets bad you need to gtfo hide and try and get a rez off blizzard is trying to rejuvenate interest in her but i still find myself cringing whenever i pick her but generally ill play ana because my accuracy is generally around
Overwatch,not_removed,i think if a person who plays anas accuracy is below then they are just bad at aiming since the hitbox for aiming is so large and im not saying that mercy and lucio are downright terrible but ana is just too good she can single target heal like crazy she can spread her healing with a grenade and hit any target in her los her ult charges faster than a bull in spain i can pretty much spam it every minutes if there is some small constant fighting going on mercys ult charges relatively quick too but for hers you have to wait on the situation of some teammates dying lucios ult while amazing is up there with one of the longest to charge unless he is solo healing for some reason and even then it takes a while zen is a fantastic damage dealer but his healing is very bad single target at a distance but holy crap is it slow it balances out since he do a lot of damage and he has discord but he isnt picked as much either because of the meta requirement that of the people in diamondearly masters needs in order to be happy and not flame if anything zen is even a higher risk and lower reward than ana ana is a jack of all trades and master of some which i think is going to be a problem for more heroes that come out from blizzard i think these newer heroes are going to try to have more functions than other heroes just because they need something new ana has a pretty diverse kit that is hard to balance damage boosts heals antiheals sleepstun and can do decent damage all from a pretty large distance
Overwatch,not_removed,he got ana achievement by not playing ana how opens link and sees genji when the video didnt even start oh nevermind
Overwatch,not_removed,you see guys having a genji in your team is basically means having all enemy heroes in you team thats another good reason to pick genji instead tank or healer s
Overwatch,not_removed,thought you deflected a nano boost onto a team mate that got kills
Overwatch,not_removed,this is why i main genji hes the only character that i can hunt for almost all the achievements with ill swap to healer as soon as get all the achievements guys i promise
Overwatch,not_removed,genji stealing achievements once more why play any other character
Overwatch,not_removed,hey sexy mama wanna kill all humans
Overwatch,not_removed,just little genji things p
Overwatch,not_removed,wait did you deflect a sleep dart deflect it back and then also deflect mcrees ult into her
Overwatch,not_removed,you can basically earn most achievements of other heroes by playing genji as long as it involves a projectile like flashbangs sleep darts heck even zarya black holes
Overwatch,not_removed,they mustve thought you were some god
Overwatch,not_removed,ooooooooooohhhhhhhh shit that was awesome
Overwatch,not_removed,everyone hates genji here because hes often weak but on the official forums everyone is crying for him to be nerfed how does this work
Overwatch,not_removed,you can deflect nano boost
Overwatch,not_removed,he deflected the sleepdart into mccrees ult
Overwatch,not_removed,whoa there
Overwatch,not_removed,theyve never played againts a good genji
Overwatch,not_removed,if people anywhere are saying that genji is weak then they probably dont know how to play genji
Overwatch,not_removed,its very easy to be bad as genji they make genji look weak if you actually see a good genji hoooo boy hope you have some lube on you
Overwatch,not_removed,a good genji which is very common at ranks imo is the most difficult and op hero to deal with the amount of mobility genji has makes him almost impossible to hit when he can constantly double jump genjis ult lasts far too long it lasts longer than a zenyatta ult genjis ult charges far too quickly so that he basically always has an ult in every pushdefence genji has very few direct counters think winston mei and zarya for their beams and he in some way counters almost every other hero in the game due to a combination of his mobility deflect ability or ability to output high damage with his shurikens with a good aim which most people have at higher ranks
Overwatch,not_removed,you must be new to blizzard games their official forums are a joke they dont moderate them very well so they are constantly spammed with garbage that usually goes against the opinions of the rest of the community the only exception ive found is the general forum of the world of warcraft forums that is pretty well moderated everything else though yikes
Overwatch,not_removed,just nerf enemy genjis and buff ally genjis
Overwatch,not_removed,hes a very high skill cap hero most players dont have the skill to utilize him to his full potential those that play him well are a valuable asset to the team those that play him really well are basically unstoppable god monsters
Overwatch,not_removed,hes difficult to play but extremely efficient when mastered
Overwatch,not_removed,because he is hella hard and bad players will be near useless while good players can outplay every other hero i cant think of anything that really counters genji yes there are some things that are able to hit him while hes deflecting and a few ults that can save you vs his ult etc but as long as the genji is good he will still be a pain in the ass i know i suck on him and cant do shit with him but i aswell would like to see a nerf or a hero that really counters him but how would you make that itd need to be a weapon that cant be blocked but has to deal enough damage to kill him before he kills you that would probably be strong vs everything else aswell but yea that aint my job to do blizzard has to come up with something in that case anyway p
Overwatch,not_removed,yes and no you can deflect the visual projectile but it wont actually do anything even if you aim it at a teammate and the enemy will still get buffed regardless
Overwatch,not_removed,is that a pro genji
Overwatch,not_removed,see i know how to play genji i just suck at doing it
Overwatch,not_removed,genjis ult lasts far too long it lasts almost twice as long as a zenyatta ult its only seconds shorter and it negates any damage within those seconds and a genji that has no resets is a dead genji especially considering a sr environment
Overwatch,not_removed,genjis ult lasts far too long it lasts almost twice as long as a zenyatta ult because it lacks the immediate oomph impact that many other ults have unless you count making mercys everywhere shitting their pants when they hear the call
Overwatch,not_removed,you didnt see a good genji unless youve seen that one sr genji guy
Overwatch,not_removed,thats funny youd mention mei cuz uh even if i focus my shit on him as hard as i can you have to solely focus your freeze on him and not miss pretty much ever if you miss for half a second you have to start over and when you dont know how long before he just dashes away genji shuts mei down hard so cut that out as a counter lmao anyone with a burst mobility option also beats mei since they shrug off the cold debuff nearly instantly and thus it takes the full freeze time to kill again
Overwatch,not_removed,reddit is a pretty big joke too
Overwatch,not_removed,the wow forums are likely a bigger cesspool really
Overwatch,not_removed,good genjis nearly instagib tracers theyll do this triple headshotdash thing that completely kills off tracer more so than than other heroes since only two shuriken are needed to take out hp and with the hp dash shes dead without being able to respond or even recall really annoying to deal with actually why does genji still gets a wallclimb on top of everything else he has i mean he can already dash vertically and double jump not to mention how his dash is meters meaning double the length of tracers dash he can straight up hit pharah while shes in the air
Overwatch,not_removed,sounds like a bug
Overwatch,not_removed,dafuq what is that from
Overwatch,not_removed,it doesnt negate any damage the healing is great but a one shot will pierce zens ult ie mercy buffed mccree headshot etc
Overwatch,not_removed,ah i thought zens ult lasted seconds edited my comment
Overwatch,not_removed,the fact that genji ults are the norm prove how op his ult is with most heroes it is difficult while still possible to get a ult junkrat pharah mccree but genji has a very easily utilized ult that will consistently get an average skill genji many kills combine that with the fact he has one every minute makes his ult the most annoying to deal with in the game lots of ults also require a large combo to get those whereas all genji has to do it run in alone and ult at the back and whale on the squishies that cant deal with him in comparison reaper who has an ult that commonly gets will generally only get those when combined with a zarya or reinhardt ult
Overwatch,not_removed,mei is still a strong counter to genji mei shouldnt ever be getting killed by genji due to her health and shift ability her main advantage against genji is her beam takes away his mobility allowing the rest of your team to focus him it basically forces genji to dash away or get killed which in itself is an advantage because it means that genji has used a really powerful cooldown and is no longer in the fight until he heals also meis ult is a reasonable counter to a genji ult as it also slows him down a lot and could result in his death if he doesnt play more passively
Overwatch,not_removed,mei is a good counter but you have to be a pretty decent mei to actually mess with a genji usually its a good idea for mei to be staying right next to her teamby the healer the entire time if she wants to be a bitch to genji thats because her freeze will make it extremely hard for genji to get any decent picks and if he trys running in she can mess with his aim a bit and slow him down and trust me you dont want to immobile next to people mei all alone is no issue for genji as he can always escape but you want to shut him down from the rest of the team so he is useless not so much kill him like a winston would try to do mei also takes shots from a dragon blade to die so if you are doing your job effectively you can either make genji try to focus you down with his ult and if he doesnt he gets constantly slows and possibly even being frozen etc
Overwatch,not_removed,in general theyre just as bad as the other forums but ive found the general forum is pretty well moderated compared to a lot of their others their tech support forums are also pretty good across all of their games and i guess thats more important
Overwatch,not_removed,who knows it behaves them same way as zaryas barrier
Overwatch,not_removed,videogamedunkey
Overwatch,not_removed,zenyatta is completely invulnerable
Overwatch,not_removed,i know but prepatch zen his healing was then it got bumped up to prepatch genji could only burst down tracer fast enough that the zen healing wouldnt have mattered whereas post patch it still works on tracer and if nanoboosted can take down characters dmg per swing dash is nanoboosted makes it dmg per swing and dash dmg
Overwatch,not_removed,no problem cheers
Overwatch,not_removed,i would like to contest a few points the fact that genji ults are the norm prove how op his ult is with most heroes it is difficult while still possible to get a ult the other ults have the added benefit of area denial or forcing the enemy to disregard everything and head for cover genjis ult does not have this effect genji has a very easily utilized ult that will consistently get an average skill genji many kills one seeing how many genjis die the moment they pop their ult not really secondly kills isnt everything although i would agree that just getting a kill on their healer and dying would be worth combine that with the fact he has one every minute makes his ult the most annoying to deal with in the game this actually requires you to hit your shots and genjis shurikens is easily one of the hardest lmbs to use lots of ults also require a large combo to get those whereas all genji has to do it run in alone and ult at the back and whale on the squishies that cant deal with him again there are multiple ways to stop him if im reinhardt or zarya i will pop my ultimate just to stop him from getting to my healers
Overwatch,not_removed,genji has a very easily utilized ult that will consistently get an average skill genji many kills so does soldier no one bitches about that and for soldier you dont even need to be in the front line you can stay behind reinhardt and he will do all the protection
Overwatch,not_removed,more specifically
Overwatch,not_removed,he meant for the ones affected by the aura
Overwatch,not_removed,mccree has an area denial ult but junkrat and pharah dont there are lots of ults that are purely there for that hero to quickly get killsa lot of damage im not saying that genji players that arent very proficient at genji are overpowered however as you improve with skill the usefulness of genji improves more than any other hero imo other than maybe mccree im only talking about ranked genji players because that is my experience and the majority of them know when and how to use their ults and consistently get with them also once again im only talking about higher skilled players at the higher ranks players are usually very good at using genjis lmb which does give them ults every minute or so again there are multiple ways to stop him if im reinhardt or zarya i will pop my ultimate just to stop him from getting to my healers as to this genji can dash out of a zarya ult and any good genji will almost never get hit by a reinhardt ult since he will be in the air andor behind or far away from the reinhardt
Overwatch,not_removed,soldier ult is very very easy to avoidcounter reinhardt shield and cover makes his ult useless if you ever get a with a soldier ult its because you will have positioned yourself well enough to get all of the squishies and you will have coordinated with your team so they distract any shield popping heroes long enough to get all the kills
Overwatch,not_removed,in gaming views since jul httpwwwredditcomryoutubefactsbotwikiindex
Overwatch,not_removed,yup thanks
Overwatch,not_removed,so does genji ult i dont see why you try to make it seems like genji is unstoppable roadhog hook mei gun mccree stun ana sleep dart can all stop genji same for genji you have to position yourself well to get all the kills you have to see who have to be eliminated first its not like you pop it and you just get all the kill unlike other q of the game you are in more risk as genji than other heros ult because you have to move around and no health buff when ult bastion for example health buff and everything you may say pharah ult is more vulnerable because shes stationary but what i find the most with her is there theres always mercy next to her in a good team genji doesnt matter how good the team is you ulted youre playing solo at that point
Overwatch,not_removed,thanks bot
Overwatch,not_removed,you cant stand up there on the opposite side despite them being identical visually as far as i could tell so yeah most likely not intended it was some fun sitting up there on certain heroes though
Overwatch,not_removed,neat
Overwatch,not_removed,you can also freeze it by placing it inside the ice wall
Overwatch,not_removed,not like sprays do anything either but some are cool to have
Overwatch,not_removed,what if we could spray our player icon
Overwatch,not_removed,hahah those poor bastards
Overwatch,not_removed,consider the only real issue has already been addressed by the comp subs being added to the sidebar no it was a kneejerk post by someone from rcompetitiveoverwatch and everyone in both subs promptly shook their heads at how dumb it was and how badly he presented the case
Overwatch,not_removed,it got swept away with all the new hero hype its not like the guy had much of an argument the only thing that came out of it was the mod team asking mods of other ow subreddits to submit their links for the sidebar other than that nada
Overwatch,not_removed,your submission has been removed the reasons being your submission falls under witch hunting which is strictly forbidden your submission falls under the category of loweffort content and does not contribute to discussions on this subreddit this includes but is not limited to posts with minimal to no text description title dae this mfw etc for more examples and details refer to our if you have any questions please state them in an answer to this post for concerns or to contact the whole staff please with the removal of my submissionmessageim writing to you about the following submission issue is for more information please consult httpswwwredditcomroverwatchwikirules
Overwatch,not_removed,working as intended
Overwatch,not_removed,why would it its not a channel would you expect your stun to stop an arrow thats already left hanzos bow
Overwatch,not_removed,hook is a projectile and the chain is attached to a winch if you stun a pharah do her rockets just stop and fall down no that would be stupid if you stun roadhog when the hook is on the way out it breaks it after it starts moving back the winch is activated and it is too late
Overwatch,not_removed,this happened to me too just a few hours ago
Overwatch,not_removed,the frustrating part is a lot of times you do it at the same time you get moved while he is stunned then the game allows the roadhog to get his combo in while you still cant do any damage or react there are a lot of things revovling around that hook that are broken and i really hope hook makes it less frustrating to play against
Overwatch,not_removed,it is attached to a winch
Overwatch,not_removed,i dont know if youre being sarcastic or its a perfectly accurate comparison because its a projectile attack and not a channeled skill to be interrupted thats just how the mechanics of the game work if you want to argue about it making sense or whatever within the context of the game youve got a lot more to scrutinize like the cyborg ninja with the magic dragon sword or the rollerblading homosexual on laser skates with a soundwave gun
Overwatch,not_removed,i then picked up reaper climbed to diamond by grouping with about sets of friends on my fav list was about to say congrats until i saw you did it with stacking so only clap clap clap for you
Overwatch,not_removed,so really the only thing youre saying is group up in a stack and play when youre available but not past am
Overwatch,not_removed,very good achievement lol not i climbed from to in weeks first fps want a hint tldr make hardware configs good learn all heroes and just keep playing the game stop with all those timing bullshit
Overwatch,not_removed,sets of friends that i trusted i wasnt a full team i just meant that there were groups of people i trusted to queue with twoards the end of season after i hit diamond i was stacking with friends to help get them up but mostly the grind was stacks dont want to inflate mmr
Overwatch,not_removed,why are you looking at this
Overwatch,not_removed,i havent really experienced any issues with this on roadhogs regularly grab me as lucio and im usually able to squeeze in a knockback to get free
Overwatch,not_removed,yeah idk its a little bit weird sometimes when roadhog hooks me as tracer i can recall out of it and sometimes i cant
Overwatch,not_removed,hold down the button that activates the ability you want to use it will activate as soon as it is able to
Overwatch,not_removed,i felt this way the other day i used to main mccree until i heard about the nerf and every time i got hooked i would spam flashbang and it would work like out of times hes definitely not op but i agee its an advantage that cant really be countered reliably
Overwatch,not_removed,that is a counter to the attack that should work most of the time instead of some
Overwatch,not_removed,banned for a single offense bwahahaha
Overwatch,not_removed,they dont do season bans for one offense so if they did thats a mistake but i somehow doubt you got banned from one leave
Overwatch,not_removed,if you feel you have been wrongfully banned open a ticket with the blizzard customer support team reddit cannot help you
Overwatch,not_removed,i thought i specified guess i forgot to put it my other bans were from the server attacks i was forced out of games and not able to rejoin though in my defence i never said a single offence thanks for assuming though
Overwatch,not_removed,first bans were from the server attacks is there any way to get a record of it
Overwatch,not_removed,i have no idea you could try submitting a ticket with as much info as possible but thats all i can think of
Overwatch,not_removed,id honestly rather just call it a tie with no ranking change than have a chance of losing a rank
Overwatch,not_removed,i do find it to be a bad mechanic many maps it seems are much easier to win on attack or defense than the other i would prefer the koth decider but i think thats what people said they used in beta and no one liked it
Overwatch,not_removed,i had defense win twice today on coin flip although i only played sudden death matches
Overwatch,not_removed,people didnt like that a payload map had a tie breaker on a koth map it forced teams to get really good at koth just to have a better chance at winning a game
Overwatch,not_removed,i think one of the big problems with this is that we probably wont see game modes where we are forced into the role of a certain character as for the mei one just no five meis can wall off a single mccree with no problem whatsoever why mccree the rest just dont really seem like theyd be that fun to play more than once
Overwatch,not_removed,maybe winston then edit also the newest brawl is only genji s and hanzos which sets a precedent for forcing roles
Overwatch,not_removed,i came here to apologize and say the same exact thing lol
Overwatch,not_removed,i appreciate that even if this is a dead post
Overwatch,not_removed,no problem there is something to be said about being wrong on the internet it just feels dirty
Overwatch,not_removed,welcome to playing with mates
Overwatch,not_removed,played the weekly brawl with friends and the other guys picked reaper so we decided to join in we quickly started beating them they changed to pharah to stop us but the pay load was left undefended so we had a nice win
Overwatch,not_removed,literally just posted something similar after watching this hahaha i think sombra and the volskaya are in on this new creation with efi
Overwatch,not_removed,i like this one of the best speculations that popped up in the last few hours i too am convinced that theres a link between efi and the numbani airport update and volskayasombra msvolskaya was in debt with sombra and maybe she requested some piece of tech that only their new robots have or maybe some blueprints of sort either way i strongly believe that this is all linked and sombra will play a big part in the new heroefi story she has all the information after all
Overwatch,not_removed,you know ned flanders from the simpsons it comes across like that
Overwatch,not_removed,howdily doodily
Overwatch,not_removed,meta soldier was ok hook every was ok
Overwatch,not_removed,upvote the post
Overwatch,not_removed,i kind of feel you on the randomness of teammates its tough to gauge i end up with a situation where my team comp is kind of ok but theres one little tweak that i know we could make to be successful and no one will switch i have no problem filling a need but no one will ever switch to fill what i was doing its frustrating as hell to make matters worse i play on console in platinum and no one uses their mic like fuck the console comes with a fucking mic and you aint lying about orisa every game has one and people havent learned how to optimize her yet
Overwatch,not_removed,same for mi get to with teammates communicating and swapping champs after that i keep getting people who dont even join voice channel nor do they swap champs and instalock widow and hanzo
Overwatch,not_removed,honestly this happens in every mode its really weird as hell qp arcade etc its like you get paired with the short bus people and the opposite team are the intelligent nerds the game seems to force a certain winrate as well
Overwatch,not_removed,i still cant find an explanation of the sudden change of player mentality which i think im asking for anyone with any ideas of why the hanzogenji cycle just kicks in
Overwatch,not_removed,you lost with a ratio be happy
Overwatch,not_removed,no one knows how exactly the matchmaking algorithm works we know that it does not just randomly assemble teams so it is rigged in some way not being transparent about it is a bad indication in itself and not suprisingly the matchmaking is ridiculously bad it indeed feels as if they serve you losses and wins intentionally without you having much influence and the side effect is that there are indeed players to totally different skill ability withing the same ranking the rating does not work at all even time of day you usually play make a big difference
Overwatch,not_removed,i understand im not extremely dedicated to comp i take it seriously for my team but i play it more casually and passively i placed low gold playing healer and i continue to play healer because no one else ever does and i had a win streak and i was extremely excited then i lost game not a big deal won another but now im getting paired with people who actually are just really incompetent and im now on a loss streak at high bronze and im not sure how to raise myself back up to gold again also im kind of unable to be an effective dps i can play dps but my mains are both tank and healer so id only do it as a fill to sacrifice so everyone else can play their mains in other categories
Overwatch,not_removed,just google forced win loss ratioblizzard pushes very very hard with their matchmaking to get everyone to
Overwatch,not_removed,so i did a game ago and it really broke the camels back dorado of course a orissa and a symmetra on defence we didnt have a pharrah counter and i went soldier on last point leaving our lucio to solo heal its fine if it wasnt for the fact that they kept dying both of them had about higher sr than me do i have to say we lost we did they played them on attack so now im gona try leave this absusive relationship for real i love the ow universe and i love the idea and i love the competition aspect but i cant stand that the people who doesnt give a shit are allowed to keep ruining it for others
Overwatch,not_removed,the comp isnt the problem usually its mostly that people arent just doing their job no matter what hero they have to consistently win matches you would have to be dps analucio and reinhardt at the same time
Overwatch,not_removed,in qp and arcade its rare that someone picks support it feels that everyone is just there for fun or learning new characters and thats fine to me you have to go competive if you want serious playing but its so much worse when you dont get that even in competive theres so much trolls and griefers at least in every other game you play that it sucks
Overwatch,not_removed,i already posted on ow forums that im looking for some players to group up with in my sr rating but noone answered yet
Overwatch,not_removed,i fill the roles in qp tbh im comfortable mostly in support or tank but my friends get mad cause its better if i do damage to kill people instead of being backup but true ive had that happen before some go as far as leaving even if youre about to win and it just tilts the entire team
Overwatch,not_removed,hiya
Overwatch,not_removed,going to repost it when itll get more attention p
Overwatch,not_removed,agree the only way to get ana potg is sharpshooter or kill man
Overwatch,not_removed,i had one once all where in saryas ult i threw in a grenade and shot a few rounds into the enemy blob lol
Overwatch,not_removed,depends if the rest of the team is doing their job or not andor distracted id almost never bother using the gun unless the target is almost dead though personally
Overwatch,not_removed,depends on who is in your comp pharah bastion and are the heroes you will want to keep damage up as much as possible everyone else is situational
Overwatch,not_removed,i use the gun quite a lot charges my ult much quicker and with those headshots i can do a lot of damage for example taking out bastion and turrets and also trying to get those with low hp in this particular situation id most likely get the gun
Overwatch,not_removed,you can compare base dmg to damage boosted stats to help make these decisions mercy pistol does dmg a shot a second for dps no fall off can headshot you can see for example dmg boosting winston is usually not worth if youre in position safe line of sight to take the shot yourself edit keep rate of fire in mind though ex bastion in sentry mode
Overwatch,not_removed,its situation specific there is no cookie cutter answer
Overwatch,not_removed,ive been trying to get used to using the pistol more its hard not to get a little tunnel vision though and cause yourself to be a tiny bit slow on swapping to heals also swapping weapons has a very small downtime from a pure paper dps standpoint its only worth boosting ults bastions and aoe damage
Overwatch,not_removed,my reinhardt playing friend always urges me to finish healing people and use the gun the classic pubsrectangle issue personally i use the damage buff only on sentry bastions or ulting soldiers pharah usually gets heals during ult since everyone will shoot at her anyway people that are constantly under fire while i heal them will get it for the sake of being able to respond faster if they get hit again after fully healing them and theres noone else needing help for everything else i use the pistol since by now i consider myself a decent shot even at longer ranges it sure takes time to get used to since at times going on killing sprees i start flanking and forget im a healer for a second
Overwatch,not_removed,when youre buffing someone every shot that hits makes a pretty distinctive fleshpenetrating sound so its pretty easy to tell if you are wasting your time buffing someone if nobody is scoring hits while buffed ill break out the pistol instead
Overwatch,not_removed,cool thanks for the spreadsheet
Overwatch,not_removed,yea me too i put up a couple of kill games against bastions and what not and now ive just been wanting to use it a little more than what im used to my average with her is and
Overwatch,not_removed,warm up first my first two or three matches in a day are always worse simply because my brain and body arent in the right place yet once i find a flow state i can stay in it without much trouble usually but sometimes getting there is hard my warmups are always on my best characters i have to commit less brain power to remembering how to use them and can focus more on getting into the right headspace
Overwatch,not_removed,i havent slept in hours so i guess that makes sense too funny i just remembered i havent slept d i shouldnt take it too hard on myself maybe i am kinda sick to but i found out my mood changed my aiming skills a lot i mean a lot if im sad i cant hit anything of the time p if im feeling good i get insanely good with her
Overwatch,not_removed,that wasnt bm at all my man
Overwatch,not_removed,if a team mate overextends dont follow him and let him die if hes in enemy territory and asks for heals respond with a group up ping never cross your front line aka stay behind the tanks try to keep people at full health especially tanks dont let them drop below hp
Overwatch,not_removed,open a thread like this in roverwatchuniversity
Overwatch,not_removed,master your movement and positioning stay safe after a team wipe to ressurrect your allies dont wait till or more but look at skulls of your teammates are dead revivie them as much as possible i usually go for or dead key character a very good dps oder main tank also look at the skull symbols wait till it is nearly finished and then revive stay safe for this time in the time the time in counting some other allies could die and one of the most important parts for me master you guardian angel lshift you can cancel it on the fly by pressing the button again so u can get in range of healing but dont get in danger and so on sometimes is shoting with your gun better than damage boosting u get more ult charge from it mainly concentrate in healing than going for ult char with your pistole i normally only damge boost something like shooting pharah or junkrat or some ults but youll get uses to it the longer you play good luck and have fun
Overwatch,not_removed,check out he was doing ama and shared some really nice mercy tips
Overwatch,not_removed,try not to get separated from your teammates always keep someone within guardian angel range a skilled mercy player can hold their own with her pistol if they get surrounded but for someone just starting out theres definitely strength in numbers stay with the group heal when someones at half health or below if they arent they can usually afford to take a hit while you focus on others unless theyre fragile like tracer then you want to give them the best chance possible if everyone in reach is good on health focus on damage buffs until you get a bit more used to fighting mercy isnt built for offensive play so let your team take care of that unless youre really confident
Overwatch,not_removed,good tips i keep finding i have people who are way too far ahead and asking for heals and im unsure if im actually expected to follow them only to get destroyed ill remain more conservative and ensure my tanksother team mates keep healed up
Overwatch,not_removed,thanks will do was unaware of that page
Overwatch,not_removed,i was looking for this before writing something this is so important and yet almost nobody knows that you can cancel lshift by pressing it again you die half of the times with this single advice only
Overwatch,not_removed,復讐が欲するのは復讐に焦がれた者のみ fukushū ga hossuru no wa fukushū ni kogareta mono nomi revenge desires only for one to seek it something like that
Overwatch,not_removed,been looking everywhere thanks
Overwatch,not_removed,obv
Overwatch,not_removed,i wouldnt worry about the actual sr number too much regarding your skill level and ability theres a lot of reliance in team work in overwatch that wont be put across by this number so for now focus on the competitive points you get so you can acquire those gold weapons enjoy
Overwatch,not_removed,according to httpmasteroverwatchcomleaderboardspcus youd be a bit above average top
Overwatch,not_removed,alright i love playing support so teamwork is no issue thats what makes this game amazing i have no idea why this is getting downvoted
Overwatch,not_removed,i wish you could disregard your sr that way i could play with plat or diamond instead of brain dead gold players
Overwatch,not_removed,thanks man
Overwatch,not_removed,seems like a neat trick but pretty useless overall can you actually contest the payload or capture point dva guns have a narrow falloff range so not doing much damage from up there
Overwatch,not_removed,seriously its one hero whos the majority of the exploits its ridiculous that they havent fixed it in at least months of it being known
Overwatch,not_removed,yep pretty ridiculous
Overwatch,not_removed,theres ways for you to go back to spawn and switch heroes
Overwatch,not_removed,that first ult suicide was hilarious
Overwatch,not_removed,the most cringe part of this was no point in switching heroes
Overwatch,not_removed,wat
Overwatch,not_removed,cant wait to have teams with healers again

Overwatch,not_removed,mercy main btw
Overwatch,not_removed,her pistol does a surprising amount of damage
Overwatch,not_removed,hey im vegan
Overwatch,not_removed,defense matrix doesnt reflect anything it removes them and reinhardt isnt a projectile so no it doesnt stop him
Overwatch,not_removed,you should probably read what your skills actually do
Overwatch,not_removed,heres my theory you shot at rein before or during his charge thus granting you the elimination and he missed you during the charge and merely knocked you away
Overwatch,not_removed,alright who wants to do some testing
Overwatch,not_removed,i think i finally got what happened
Overwatch,not_removed,i wish i got recorded footage but that reinhardts would have pinned me down and it resulted in a red elimination he fell because of my defense matrix while standing still
Overwatch,not_removed,
Overwatch,not_removed,it did happen
Overwatch,not_removed,maybe because i was higher on the stairs and reinhardt was below was why it worked or is it a timed thing or a glitch
Overwatch,not_removed,i was standing still the whole time but he certainly hit my defense matrix
Overwatch,not_removed,reinhardt is literally not a projectile
Overwatch,not_removed,
Overwatch,not_removed,
Overwatch,not_removed,so why did reinhardt get knock back it was one on one on one lijiang tower drop and he was charging up the stairs i just stood there and put up the matrix im going to try this again later
Overwatch,not_removed,im confused how is that different from him charging someone else off a cliff
Overwatch,not_removed,maybe reinhart wont get knocked back or does that happen when he runs out of charge
Overwatch,not_removed,idk but that video looked identical to every reinhardt charge thats killed me support main here reinhardt kills are half of my deaths or more
Overwatch,not_removed,i dont remember being fully charged but i think the animation did happen for a sec and then he got knocked back into the abyss he was pretty far so he must of run out of charge tagged me which resulted in a kill im not sure if the shields should be on or not for knock back or me standing there was good enough
Overwatch,not_removed,im pretty sure you get it at the end of the season correct me im wrong though
Overwatch,not_removed,okay thanks in that case the description should probably be changes
Overwatch,not_removed,despite this the team will tell you to switch and even if you continue to steam roll the enemy team the lucio will still get all the commendations what a cruel world we live in
Overwatch,not_removed,i wish i was this good with widowmaker
Overwatch,not_removed,find opponents afk
Overwatch,not_removed,would be pretty nice like having gravity gauntlets then can levitate people
Overwatch,not_removed,a lot of people seem to get the same idea bout the dark matter on oasis now

Overwatch,not_removed,sigh
Overwatch,not_removed,it actually reminds of the kinetic class from skyforge

Overwatch,not_removed,not
Overwatch,not_removed,i think it is more of the reverse when healing someone they most likely wanted to keep the healing to over time and just did the same for damage
Overwatch,not_removed,a lucio can save you by hp

Overwatch,not_removed,man i didnt know that was a real sub lol
Overwatch,not_removed,thanks lol btw dont reply to it
Overwatch,not_removed,id say the best way to find friends is to just play the game and find people you get along withhave good chemistry with

Overwatch,not_removed,oh yeah thats important ill add that thanks
Overwatch,not_removed,but i want bonus exp too
Overwatch,not_removed,are you euna pcconsole i play quite a lot after work and wouldnt mind helping out overbuff for we
Overwatch,not_removed,napc what time do you play
Overwatch,not_removed,unfortunately i am eu but i can give you the below insight its my comment from another post just for information i got placed rose to then dropped to this drop was a mixture of playing bad being tilted and being toxic i have since learned but i have now manage to climb back up to this was all done solo btw what i found best for me when trying to climb back up was playing flex although ive mainly played mccree and genji i will change to zarya or rein as you have probably read zarya is very good for carrying at lower sr use voice chat another common answer but i cant stress the importance of using voice comms in such a team based game like ow even if you just call out simple things genji top right dva mech down zen has ult will help a lot being supportive to team mates actually made a huge difference if someone isnt performing well dont berate them try to encourage them having a positive outlook on the game can make a difference even little comments like nice shield zarya great pick road are good i think this next one was the biggest factor take a break i will take a min break every games even if i won all those game relax watch a stream grab some food whatever but i felt personally that this made a huge difference to my game play i would come back feeling fresh and ready
Overwatch,not_removed,well done
Overwatch,not_removed,that precision german engineering tho
Overwatch,not_removed,i love the simplegeometry
Overwatch,not_removed,if youre going to flash more than one word on a screen for less than a second you should try putting it in the same spot or go without it or leave it there longer
Overwatch,not_removed,upvoted everyone needs to see this
Overwatch,not_removed,this is gold
Overwatch,not_removed,perfectly timed very nicely done indeed
Overwatch,not_removed,best rein play ive seen in a long time
Overwatch,not_removed,wahey
Overwatch,not_removed,brownman is that ray
Overwatch,not_removed,is this a pro reinhardt
Overwatch,not_removed,nothing like a little surprise rein to spice up your push
Overwatch,not_removed,i want to know what that bastion player was thinking
Overwatch,not_removed,thanks for all the nice comments guys i am in fact not a pro rein i barely play him but some friends of mine just picked up the game so ive been practicing him a lot if you want to watch the video of this its here around minutes something i just upload for my friends httpsyoutubeasrkuudmkfk
Overwatch,not_removed,precision german engineering
Overwatch,not_removed,brownman the same one as roy from challenge finders s
Overwatch,not_removed,thanks i was flabbergasted when i realised id made the hit hahaha i lost it
Overwatch,not_removed,as an avid hanzo hater i felt it was necessary
Overwatch,not_removed,yeah i really lazily edited this in this video httpsyoutubeasrkuudmkfk for my friends and normally wouldnt add text but my mic wasnt working this recording youre absolutely right i just spent little to no time on refining it haha
Overwatch,not_removed,haha everyone keeps asking me this its just my friend whos last name is brownman p
Overwatch,not_removed,hello it me
Overwatch,not_removed,i wouldve loved to see the kill cam
Overwatch,not_removed,that was some precision german engineering
Overwatch,not_removed,i understand completely in my opinion there should be a subreddit dedicated to the hating of hanzos and their scatter arrows seriously though those scatter arrows are the worst
Overwatch,not_removed,there is a popular streamer who goes by the xbox gamertag brownman thats why ive actually played overwatch with him on his girlfriends stream on pc but just remembered on battlenet he writes it namnworb so it couldnt be him
Overwatch,not_removed,it would just show this gif though wouldnt it
Overwatch,not_removed,please make it i will join in a heartbeat i made the ragiest post on this very topic in this weeks rage thread lol
Overwatch,not_removed,yeah a few people have mentioned him ill have to check him out
Overwatch,not_removed,itd show the bastions point of view just him hanging out next minute pinned
Overwatch,not_removed,my account isnt a month old yet so i cant make a subreddit but as soon as i can i will do so
Overwatch,not_removed,the kill cam shows from the pov from the person who killed you it wouldve just shown him your screen that you already know i wouldve loved to see the kill cam bastions pov would have been better wording p
Overwatch,not_removed,welcome my friend well i will be so down hahaha
Overwatch,not_removed,hahahahaha yep youre right i am half asleep today
Overwatch,not_removed,whew this one took a while to make things i will say before you say yes the medigun looks weird yes mercy looks like shes gonna kill herself yes the poster is kinda inbalanced with bias to blue idk i kinda like blue yes robotdemo has a giant glowing stick sword yes there are no particles would probably take too much fps yes mercys flap is under reaper kinda looks weird but ill fix it later yes reaper is not symmetrical to mercy noticed that after postprocess dont wanna fix it i think of them are gimped in cause the sfm session could not handle any more models riperronis yes i posted this to and rsfm for karma
Overwatch,not_removed,pharah main here even average soldiers and mccrees force pharah to play differently even if they arent killing her at every opportunity if shes too much of a problem for your dps alone then a zenyatta or ana can really mess her up when it comes to a pharmercy though thats a huge problem if theyre both good you need all the counters and coordination you can get to make sure you eliminate them make sure to focus mercy first ofc
Overwatch,not_removed,pharah is deadly in the right hands when two teams start out with pharah the team with the better pharah will dominate this forces the other team to switch off pharah because her use becomes limited and they must pick an antiair hero which lets be honest is quite limited when facing a good pharah go mccree good luck getting killed by soldierwinstons go soldier good luck getting targetted asap by pharah making you useless go winstondva prepare to get melted by reaperreinzarya the problem with pharah domination is that the other team is free to pick counters to pharah counters which in my opinion is unfair af most powerful combination so far i have seen today winston pharah and reaper auto gg
Overwatch,not_removed,i personally start feeling a lot of frustration about phara the average soldier is not able to counter properly until they get ult mccree has too much dps loss at long distances that makes him hard to use torbjörn turrets get wrecked from distance pretty easily and widowmaker is a russian roulette to have in team moreover phara is the easiest dps character to be effective with she is pretty easy to be played consistently making even the most averagephara a trouble to deal with my personal feeling is that her skill floor is somehow too low but i couldn´t imagine which kind of action could be taken on her to make her lees cheesy
Overwatch,not_removed,she hasnt received any buffs in a long long time as far as gaming time is concerned games are objective based not killdeath based httpsgfycatcomshinyregularhog if a pharah is actively trying to stop a team capping an objective she has to put herself in the absolute most vulnerable position for that hero close range cqc thats more than an ample opportunity for any competent team to eliminate her with ease
Overwatch,not_removed,fixed
Overwatch,not_removed,how did u get gold heals as honzo
Overwatch,not_removed,no because the ow community isnt a bunch of year olds who are too ignorant to use the easier character cod is really the only community to blame players for using certain weapons pretty much every other community blames the devs for putting something op
Overwatch,not_removed,torbjorn and symmetra are generally considered lowskill and rarely see pro play blizzard has said theyre reworkingbuffing symmetra so well see how that goes bastion has generally been considered a noobstomper thats worthless against good players then people started running triple tanks in competitive games and a pro player busted out a surprise successful bastion pick the other day hes extremely effective against tanks if you catch them off guard a lot of people seem to think mei is cheapunfair to go up against she can definitely be frustrating to fight and there are a bunch of heroes who pretty much cant kill her unless her abilities are on cooldown
Overwatch,not_removed,bastion hes reks new players and is very easy to play not sure if thats what you mean tho
Overwatch,not_removed,bastion junkrat i do enjoy playing with junkrat every now and then tho used to use him heaps before comp started
Overwatch,not_removed,there is no character but there are cheese for example bastion torb and rein in defence healers and a symmetra or mei this will work quite well when use occasionally in the middle and lower tier
Overwatch,not_removed,bastion not entirely unwarranted as his sentry mode is literally just point and click

Overwatch,not_removed,junkrat infuriates me haha
Overwatch,not_removed,i would really recommend taking a step back from the game people are assholes and will say rude things no matter what hell im in masters and there are videos online with hundreds of thousands of views of sssniperwolf calling me a retard if you came here for an answer of how to make people not be mean im sorry to say you cant however you can change how you react to it things to keep in mind are everyone you are matched with are near your skill level so anyone insulting you is only insulting themselves and are likely just frustrated with their own abilities and its just a game these guys getting worked up are the ones that try to make it seem like sr is everything and like they are perfect flawless players even though they clearly arent if they are in silver they are averageslightly below average players with anger issues and no regard for the feelings of other people words hurt but you give them the power to make them hurt its is so much easier said than done but just shrug it off they dont know you they dont deserve to know you they are just random assholes all you can do is do your best and for them to ask any more of you than that is moronic and honestly there are times when muting is the best option there is nothing wrong in muting them if they arent going to be productive anyway its definitely a better solution than quitting and basically proving their point in their minds hope you feel better edit also didnt realize i wrote so much haha sorry for the giant wall of text ive always been kind of a therapist for all my friends so i try to help set things in reality
Overwatch,not_removed,if people are spending the entire match putting others down theyre not actually contributing meaningfully to the chat and can be safely ignored the mute button is your friend if its persistent or abusive report them as well
Overwatch,not_removed,emotional blows hit the hardesti know if its constructive advice like go for the mercy then i suggest trying that out next time but yeah there are more than a couple ragers out there who talk s and hurl personal insults please dont feel too bad acknowledge that as long as you dont do the same thing back to them you are the better person and you are the nice gamer that makes up the majority of the player base for me after a couple of those stressful games i like to go on an rp server and just chill for a while sit on a bench and watch people rp or even take part and pretend to sell ramen in that building in hanamura haha or play some of your favorite songs and turn up the volume or sit back close your eyes and think about that time when the ana said thank you or when that push was successful because you ulted at just the perfect time but i hope that at the end of the day you believe that there are good days and there are bad days think if this was a bad day tomorrow will be a good day hope you feel better soon
Overwatch,not_removed,well its a short advice but simply muting them solves your problem really
Overwatch,not_removed,youre making some very basic and fundamental flaws youre joining team chat with a bunch of strangers youre assuming groups of random players will have any sort of overarching strategy whether youll accept it or not the overwatch matchmaker goes out of its way to group players of similar capability together that means that the random teammates the matchmaker has assigned you are fundamentally only as good as you are nbsp you need to be confident enough in your own ability that you can make decisions on your own and not rely on others to do it for you the majority of the time your decision is more likely than not to have been the best possible course of action for the situation httpsgfycatcomshinyregularhog
Overwatch,not_removed,whenever people start yelling at you sometimes you need to just tell yourself its just a game and you probably are a better person than they are
Overwatch,not_removed,give it right back to them stand up for yourself if you make logical arguments and call the dicks out for their assholery theyll think twice youll also feel better about it 😘
Overwatch,not_removed,i have only advice for you and it carries over to real life people are mean and people are idiots do not ever care again what people say who are people anyway and why would you care what they say do you think their opinions and choices are worth more than yours they are not not at all just ignore them or if you so prefer fire back but dont ever get emotionally involved or in other words you need more selfesteem let me tell you you are worth way more than you think and certainly more than those idiots you described act like it
Overwatch,not_removed,one thing i heard and i also tried it recently is to be extremely confident in your abilities almost arrogant but dont cross that line if you can believe in yourself you can do so much better and if they still shit talk you just mute them clearly if they are going to spend more time flaming you than actually playing you need to just not listen and do your best we all have the potential to do something great you included dont let others bring you down
Overwatch,not_removed,if you disagree with what they are saying then thats that people talk shit when they are tilted i do it all the time but not on the game chat to the actual person lol
Overwatch,not_removed,if players arent being rude take a moment and hear what they said listen for the actionable intel like youre our kill pharah plz or flankers killing supports but mainly you have no reason to care what some randos online say about your performance especially if youre lower ranks like that ignore everyone youre not playing to impress them if people are rude you have every reason to just mute them
Overwatch,not_removed,have you actually ever considered that those people saying do x or y or z actually would be happy if you do x y or z belched out shoot down that f pharah isnt the nicest thing but actually its a good advice gutgud might be wrong but man up or women up seems like a good advice or stay away from teamchat but thats a bad advice to be honest
Overwatch,not_removed,you may not be a therapist but you described psychological concepts of projection problem solving locus of control and empathy good on you 😊
Overwatch,not_removed,thank you
Overwatch,not_removed,damn i forgot reporting was a thing never had a reason to do it before thanks
Overwatch,not_removed,your comment in particular made me feel a lot better thank you
Overwatch,not_removed,good advice as always but in this case not the right advice this is more about abusive teammates in voice chat than it is about coordination or lack of
Overwatch,not_removed,i know i am sometimes its good to just take a step back
Overwatch,not_removed,thank you sometimes i am confident in my abilities when im actually having a good play day and get potg and stuff but when i play games where i get killed over and over and over without even getting to do anythingit can get to me sometimes im a very emotional person so it can be hard to not get emotionally involved but it is good advice thanks for your comment
Overwatch,not_removed,they were being rude they were insulting me specifically when i was doing the best i could and making my own judgment calls i just never had experienced it before so i didnt know how to react all the comments here are helping me though thank you for yours
Overwatch,not_removed,yeah i know sometimes they give good advice and thats fine but they were needlessly insulting me when i was doing the best i could and telling me to get on the point when they arent even on the point like wat
Overwatch,not_removed,nono the burn was there ops shit talkers think theyre hot stuff but theyre fundamentally around the same skill level as op so their shit talking is meaningless
Overwatch,not_removed,theres an assumption that voice chat is beneficial and thats fundamentally where the problem stems from its better to address the root cause of a problem then some bandaid fix to address the symptoms id rather destroy the illusion than pretend pigs can fly
Overwatch,not_removed,good stuff a pattern ive noticed ppl who use too many words when they should be just shot calling are the ones who rageexplain cheers
Overwatch,not_removed,except that the players talking shit to you arent actually any better than you does not fix the problem of players talking shit to you in the first place which is what ops complaint seems to be about
Overwatch,not_removed,im not confident with my playing ability as it is the op has a confidence problem and theyve ended up placing them self into a hostile situation because they thought it would be beneficial if the op wasnt in team chat they would have never had to deal with the abusive comments if the op realise that the teammates were no different to they were ie they were equals there should be no confidence issues needing to be addressed its one thing to have a teacherstudent relationship its another to be peers on equal terms
Overwatch,not_removed,do you mean the battlenet desktop app if an update is stuck close the battlenet app completely open task manager and end the battlenet update agentexe process reopen battlenet and the update should go through
Overwatch,not_removed,why were they so clumped up together and what the hell is up with dvas fingers in the intro
Overwatch,not_removed,is this easy mode
Overwatch,not_removed,shes only holding up one finger instead of the for a peace sign weird
Overwatch,not_removed,meanwhile the payload
Overwatch,not_removed,no emote
Overwatch,not_removed,and a turret
Overwatch,not_removed,it really bothers me that the kill feed doesnt have spots blizzard plz
Overwatch,not_removed,
Overwatch,not_removed,the thing that always ruins potg for me is that sprays are bugged does it really take that much to fix
Overwatch,not_removed,dude you didnt even emote
Overwatch,not_removed,is she pointing up or making a piece sign i cant tell
Overwatch,not_removed,excuse me while i change my pants
Overwatch,not_removed,for some reason i thought the title meant dvas unleash their ults at the same time
Overwatch,not_removed,what i am so weirded out by the fact that dva is not showing the peace sign in the highlight oo
Overwatch,not_removed,as junkard dva ulti should be able to be destroyed its really unfair that junkard is so trash bc his q is really weak
Overwatch,not_removed,
Overwatch,not_removed,thanks for emilating keemstar
Overwatch,not_removed,ugh i played against a dva team the other day it was so stupid we got destroyed trying to defend point bthey just threw in their ults at the same time and it was over
Overwatch,not_removed,wtf is going on here wheres the payload at least one of these teams is playing really poorly
Overwatch,not_removed,im not sure about you guys on pc but i so tired of dva ults getting play of the game on when they shouldnt
Overwatch,not_removed,its hard not to see that there were only cards clearly a steamroll game
Overwatch,not_removed,d va removed from the game myself removed from life
Overwatch,not_removed,if you look very closely you can notice that enemies has been knocked down by reinhardt ult right after dva launched her ult what we see there is a good ult combo
Overwatch,not_removed,its a highlight bug sadly
Overwatch,not_removed,nobody on the payload ever in any game i play it does my head in
Overwatch,not_removed,are you talking about her right hand because thats her right foot not her fingers
Overwatch,not_removed,it looks like rein ulted them
Overwatch,not_removed,shes prob telling to wait while she bubblegum as if somebody was about to say smthg fit the personality too
Overwatch,not_removed,yea i noticed this too what the fuck
Overwatch,not_removed,she does have a voice line that says dva one bad guys zero it could be referring to this based on the skin youre wearing at the time
Overwatch,not_removed,
Overwatch,not_removed,in some countries its considered rude to do the peace sign with the palm inward same reason they turned the v sign around in the uk on the cover of left dead
Overwatch,not_removed,
Overwatch,not_removed,the op is on the attacking team on kings row the payload is behind them all it looks like the reinhardt got an ana ult and went super deep and the rest of his team smelled blood and charged in after him
Overwatch,not_removed,its overwatch both teams are playing really poorly
Overwatch,not_removed,highlights will show achievement sprays
Overwatch,not_removed,remember that the game believes you are about as good as the idiots it matches you with
Overwatch,not_removed,man either youre lying or youre in the same que as these people how do you find these games where people are oblivious or they just dont want to play the game
Overwatch,not_removed,no look at it she doesnt do a peace sign she does like a fingered thing
Overwatch,not_removed,yes i like that explanation d thats probably it
Overwatch,not_removed,im in the uk and she does the two fingered peace sign
Overwatch,not_removed,highlights dont seem to load any sprays other than the overwatch emblem
Overwatch,not_removed,yeah i dont doubt it i at least have the mental capacity to try help the team win not just roam around doing my own thing games an hour ago i went on the team all decides to go genji i leave that game and head into the next the team all decides to go reinhardt
Overwatch,not_removed,just played a payload game snipers sitting back reaper mercy roaming for kills i was rein pushing alone for most of the game teams just want kills thats all they are interested in ive met genjisphrarahs and mccrees using their alt against me alone nobody else about jut so they can get the kill
Overwatch,not_removed,rank atm got the game like weeks ago got a quintuple on point with phara only person left was junkrat i was low hp dropped down onto the point junk killed me and my team was nowhere to be found no where
Overwatch,not_removed,queue
Overwatch,not_removed,its possible this is a game from the uk maybe i know that the peace sign in reverse is a rude gesture in the realm of the middle finger
Overwatch,not_removed,i thought she was just saying to wait a sec
Overwatch,not_removed,i think this happens with lowmedium model settings ive seen it with zenyatta highlights but it only happens in the replay not in the inventory
Overwatch,not_removed,i noticed that too it bothers me
Overwatch,not_removed,i think shes just pointing upwards or perhaps saying
Overwatch,not_removed,that or high score
Overwatch,not_removed,strange also now when i look at it her bubble doesnt pop or even appear either seems like the highlight intro is just bugged in the highlight place and maybe in the game and not censoring like i originally thought
Overwatch,not_removed,its the peace sign pointed away from the camera towards the camera it is not the peace sign it is the offensive symbol devourerofviagra mentioned
Overwatch,not_removed,they will load non character specific ones like thanks or well played
Overwatch,not_removed,all reinhardt is amazing
Overwatch,not_removed,damn i guess im lucky i never run into that team i hear stories all the time im so glad if someone on my team widows they play her like they are widowmaker irl
Overwatch,not_removed,im from the uk and she holds up httpiimgurcomgmzoeqwjpg idk
Overwatch,not_removed,upwards ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°
Overwatch,not_removed,i like the bubblegum version her popping a bubble is more important than you saying something d
Overwatch,not_removed,yeah probably just a bug if something like that had been censored we should all just give up because the pc police have already won p
Overwatch,not_removed,i dont mind snipers but some people just play for kills most of my teams seem to just play for themselves i like playing reign but when its just me moving the payload and the rest of the team chasing down a mercyreaper it gets frustrating fast
Overwatch,not_removed,oh weird i have no idea then
Overwatch,not_removed,names dva for a reason
Overwatch,not_removed,this is always my issue ill single handedly make sure the objective gets pushed right up to the approaching point then we cant get it therewhos fault is it mine of course and why dont we just leave the game because reignme is terrible
Overwatch,not_removed,im murican and its were
Overwatch,not_removed,the game doesnt promote kd either so its not like they need to roam they just want potg for their epeens if i get play of the game thats great but guaranteed my potg would be on or near the objective in some way
Overwatch,not_removed,just ignore them if you get hanged up on it youll play worst
Overwatch,not_removed,taiwan numba one
Overwatch,not_removed,when i move up its because im playing a disrupter who can keep at least back so id jump back there closer to their spawn im thinking of kings row and genji in this situation and just start pulling people back so itll be easier to snowball win if you dont know what snowballing means in this situation its like a train when youre playing you defend easily but they get one objective and suddenly its impossible to stop them like a snowball down a hill of snow
Overwatch,not_removed,oh it doesnt get me down i just get more frustrated i have to play a game with or less people but thats the tale of ranked without a party
Overwatch,not_removed,thats fine i understand tracer and reaper are somewhat assassins and there role is to pick loners off and disrupt but you can tell when they are just not interested in helping and running ahead to do there own thing trying to get that all important play of the game
Overwatch,not_removed,shes and stys reaching for anything that can fill minutes
Overwatch,not_removed,it was more the first mins of the video minus the music part
Overwatch,not_removed,i used to have this issue during beta along with a lot of people i believe and im no expert it has to do with how much data the game and voice chat consume turning off open mic and setting it to push to talk solved the issue for me since then ive upgraded my internet and the problem is gone so i cant reproduce it hope it helps
Overwatch,not_removed,similiar to this after my group starts leaving off like people maybe at a time or whatever the chat just gives me an error and i cant join any kind lf voice chats at all if i do change the chats it wont say anything happened only thing that helps is resetting the application
Overwatch,not_removed,im having the same problem havent found a solution yet except to restart the game hoping this gets fixed
Overwatch,not_removed,i have this too usually i automatically rejoin the voice chat when the next round starts but my ptt key has changed really weird
Overwatch,not_removed,im always on push to talk and i keep experiencing this feelsbadman
Overwatch,not_removed,yup when i restart it fixes it for a match or two
Overwatch,not_removed,thanks damn i have to be to get it lol im only p
Overwatch,not_removed,you mean free for all
Overwatch,not_removed,this is a team base game a think like that will not work
Overwatch,not_removed,all credit goes to my friend tom for the amazing play
Overwatch,not_removed,all credit goes to my friend junkrat for the amazing play
Overwatch,not_removed,but hey no dragonblade is always a welcomed changed for genji potgs
Overwatch,not_removed,go to cusersusernamedocumentsoverwatchsettings and delete the settings file in there this will reset your settings in game after that you should start the game from the overwatchexe in your ow folder not from battlenet launcher had the same issue and this fixed the game for me
Overwatch,not_removed,i tested it out a little still a bit of fps drop but overall huge improvement thank you
Overwatch,not_removed,no prob glad it helped
Overwatch,not_removed,doesnt have a save recording feature couldnt you play the highlight then save it thats all i do on pc i have a button that records last seconds so i just go down my cool highlights and record them ill break them apart and put them into a video later
Overwatch,not_removed,id recommend obs studio i just set hotkeys for recording to stopstart so i dont have to bother breaking them apart
Overwatch,not_removed,i dont think so
Overwatch,not_removed,i have obs as well but raptrplaytv is always running and its just a click i can usually get highlights in per click i have to edit them anyways so its not a huge deal
Overwatch,not_removed,fair enough there have been times i wished i had obs open midmatch too having something open all the time would be nice i often forget to open obs
Overwatch,not_removed,oh yeah its definitely better in the long run i just get lazy and like click answers sometimes lol
Overwatch,not_removed,playing symmetra on anubis on defense can be so entertaining at times there are so many nice spots on that map to set up her microwave rooms
Overwatch,not_removed,they kept running into that room to get the health pack there but instead all they got was turrets
Overwatch,not_removed,torb a loved character
Overwatch,not_removed,hes always been a way to annoy people being strong or weak
Overwatch,not_removed,this was uh quite a while ago
Overwatch,not_removed,but he was buffed he now generates scrap over time
Overwatch,not_removed,someone should post the same picture of widowmaker in the comments of the same picture of tracer everyday
Overwatch,not_removed,at least we know its not a lie
Overwatch,not_removed,what a beatiful and smart idea

Overwatch,not_removed,i find you hilarious first of all how could they even find alts second of all do u think that people who cant play with their friends because of rank difference should not be able to play with them
Overwatch,not_removed,not against the tos to have two accounts dont cry mate
Overwatch,not_removed,only morons say lel must be a pre teen
Overwatch,not_removed,hmmm idk retard their low account level the fact that the account is brand new and other accounts are on the same ip idiot or that they get put into matches with other people on real accounts no hard at all moron
Overwatch,not_removed,respect your elder then
Overwatch,not_removed,lel salt
Overwatch,not_removed,i have a brother he has his own account should i get banned because we have the same ip dont talk about stuff you know nothing about please
Overwatch,not_removed,oh so if my brother gets ow and plays it his is an alternative account for me ok dumbass
Overwatch,not_removed,here come dat bot
Overwatch,not_removed,leaving is leaving no matter the reason
Overwatch,not_removed,also i just noticed that i whiffed attack because i flicked at zenyattas flying dead body
Overwatch,not_removed,not sure what pros use but i like logi weights its very heavy for fps games i had and replaced it with zowie since it was too heavy for me i have much less wrist pain now and its easier to aim
Overwatch,not_removed,look for rocket jump ninjas videos on youtube he recently released a top of recommended mice channel is more than you need if you cant make your mind up its way less cluttered and not full of shit unlike most youtube channels where people say uh yeah this feels really good and the sensor is super super accurate just please make sure you get a wide mousepad doesnt even matter what it is it can be as cheap as a qck or as expensive as an artisan mousepad or a zowie gsr
Overwatch,not_removed,thanks for the info the zowie looks pretty big do you have big hands
Overwatch,not_removed,the is just thats on the higher end of medium weight for reference a good amount of pros use a deathadder which is the is useable in games like this if you use your arm enough
Overwatch,not_removed,not really my hand length is actually there is a smaller version of the same mouse zowie and i wanted to buy it first but read the reviews and one guy said that its too small so i bought and it fits perfectly
Overwatch,not_removed,if zowie i can recommend the za series which comes in sizes they have a slightly higher backbump which i preferred over the fk the only proplayers sens i know is aseagull from luminosity playing at i play at
Overwatch,not_removed,weird i looked it up on some websites and it says is fine tho
Overwatch,not_removed,hmmkay maybe i try a bigger mousepad first qck ie and think about the mouse in the future the was a gift from my girlfriend so i could run into some trouble changing my mouse in the near future d

Overwatch,not_removed,do you mean xp or do you mean rank progression since i cant follow you if we are talking about xp since everything seems normal
Overwatch,not_removed,rank progression sorry should of made that more clear
Overwatch,not_removed,no prob just wondered since xp for leveling up didnt seem to be way to low compared the time you spent agree progression should be better balanced this way no matter how good the game was it has almost no impact
Overwatch,not_removed,if seen this picture before here nice try reposting
Overwatch,not_removed,oh okay
Overwatch,not_removed,youre assuming she didnt cause the mess in the airport
Overwatch,not_removed,itsameee video game
Overwatch,not_removed,context matters here we have hardly any context for efis characters the events or what shes doing so its creating some contradictory mental images
Overwatch,not_removed,well that is sort of what im implying here
Overwatch,not_removed,nice
Overwatch,not_removed,is this a mario reference thats just going right over my head lol
Overwatch,not_removed,theyre saying not to think about it too much at least in a realism sense because its a video game
Overwatch,not_removed,thats a very very confusing way to get that message across lol
Overwatch,not_removed,dont worry i did a fair amount of guessing and assuming there
Overwatch,not_removed,you truly are a scientist
Overwatch,not_removed,for those who want actual discussion roverwatchuniversity is currently the better place to go for it hopefully roverwatch can sort this potg spam out sooner rather than later
Overwatch,not_removed,the games only been out a few days of course theres not going to be much discussion past hey look at this cool potg if you really dont want to see them use the filters on the sidebar and the problem solves itself
Overwatch,not_removed,seriously people are complaining meanwhile potgs on front pages get upvotes clearly majority likes them as a fan of overwatch i believe something should be done not much we can do as long as potg are so heavily favored were vocal minority in this case and honestly i dont have a problem going to other subreddits for meaningful discussion those subs are smaller but theyre filled with people who actually interested in getting better and have something to say discussions here are mostly i got killed by nerf plz i am mercy love me psa press w to move forward psa
Overwatch,not_removed,i know this and this is why im saying its a problem
Overwatch,not_removed,i got this tho
Overwatch,not_removed,do not fear the iris brother embrace its gaze and it too shall embrace you
Overwatch,not_removed,we are all equal within the iris
Overwatch,not_removed,i have four hours in this game and have a wl record of i am lvl and yet i managed to get placed in matches with people that are above level this is kind of killing overwatch for me since i get crushed almost every single match i play edit im good at the game now so this is not an issue anymore
Overwatch,not_removed,you are onto something though last few days every single round has been up against people that completely outclass my team be it pubs or my usual group
Overwatch,not_removed,i feel it has major issues with soloq as well it seems that if you have too high a winrate the system basically forces you closer to by putting increasingly worse players on your team i had a winrate when i checked a day or two ago and games were really fun with great teamplay and then things took a sudden turn for the worse today i went on a terrible losing streak like or something despite the competition feeling as weak as ever its just the teammates the mm system has paired me with have been on par with release day level no grouping no comms no awareness no aim no impact like im getting most elims as lucio and most objective time as widow id put it up to bad luck but it literally happened like games in a row i noticed on the masteroverwatch site all the top players on the leaderboards have close to a winrate so theres obviously something going on there which is i guess what mmr is supposed to do bring you closer to that winrate but i feel the way it currently does it is not right it should do that by giving you better or worse competition not handicapping you with terrible teammates or boosting you with godlike ones its just really frustrating and made for the first bad time ive had playing this game
Overwatch,not_removed,matchmaking is not based on level there is no solution aside from trying to find a party with a similar spread in experience which may not exist this is the case for basically any multiplayer game thats just the sacrifice you have to make when you play with friends who are new to the game
Overwatch,not_removed,levels are not used as matchmaking criteria as they are not necessarily representative of skill in the same way that total games played would not be representative of skill
Overwatch,not_removed,it seems to me like it doesnt matter how good or bad you play doesnt matter what you or your team does your win ration will be around win too much and they will place you with a poor team win too little and they place you with a great team you wont find a single individual of the million people that have bought the game that doesnt have a win ratio maybe the ranking system will change this but there is no context to a win did you win against a team ive gotten gold medals for eliminations so everyone else on my team made eliminations or less how in the hells is that possible
Overwatch,not_removed,it infuriates me i feel like im not rewarded for my actual skill level because the game purposely prevents me from winning too many games by teaming me up with braindead players ive never seen a single player have an above win rate due to exactly this
Overwatch,not_removed,whilst this is somewhat annoying i think a greater issue is being queued into random games as a ringer with almost no time left on the clock but still counting as a loss i dont mind being a ringer but i think it should at least put a barrier on how late in a game it stops searching if a team is being roflstomped and theres seconds left on the clock then i dont stand a chance its not fun at all
Overwatch,not_removed,
Overwatch,not_removed,this is the most pathetic and horrendous matchmaking system i have ever encountered as a solo player its utterly pathetic with senseless points you can get thrown into game and get defeated immediately thrown into games thats left like under a min or about to get defeated basically it just puts anyone and everyone together regardless of level or skill imo its the most pathetic mm system in all of shooter games i would say no effort and thought has been put into it
Overwatch,not_removed,there is definitely something off with this matchmaking system at least on up until level i was grouped with players i never saw a high level player maybe was the highest no prestige no level i pretty much dominated then i hit level now i am always grouped up with higher level players theres usually a prestige theres always level and its rare that anyone is around my level despite that we usually get dominated i think what this game needs is separate playlists for people in parties i had this issue in call of duty as well people create parties of people and then wind up being paired with a bunch of people who didnt create a party making it very easy to stack teams at any rate this pretty much destroyed the game for me i got to level within a week so im still pretty new but now that im playing with much higher levels who all use advanced tactics and gamebreaking strategies its really difficult to learn new characters that sort of change should happen graduallynot from one level to the next
Overwatch,not_removed,are you seriously complaining about that im level and the minimum i face is and max is prestiged alone there is no fucking mms
Overwatch,not_removed,im level and i solo queue a lot i regularly get matched into games with level players and my win rate is around i win some games and i lose some its kept my win rate pretty even but thats just pubs ive played competitive placement matches and only won one whatever teams i get autolock their favorite hero and o always get stuck playing support i dont mind playing support but when youre playing ana or mercy and your only tank hero rushes around a corner where you cant heal them that tank is dead and then you get blamed for it nobody ever switches their hero midgame and at the end of it all even though i have healing i get blamed for our loss not our reinhardt who charges face first into a pair of zaryas not that one person who always plays soldier and treats the game like a freeforall cod match nope its always the healers fault no matter what
Overwatch,not_removed,if levelstime played arent used as matchmaking criteria then what is what else is there in a noncompetitive game setting an mmr system doesnt work when the sample size for a level is games compared to the hundreds that the other players have not to mention if mmr was what theyre going off of then i seriously doubt a level even has the same mmr as a level as someone who has friends who have bought into the overwatch hype at completely different times after its release there appears to be measure of players by any metric in matchmaking
Overwatch,not_removed,as sad as it is blizzard games tends to have bad matchmaking after a certain point mostly when it comes to high level ranked games which isnt the case here matchmaking in ow doesnt really care about levels when it comes to it though it filters it in a way for an example its highly unlikely to get level and below alliesenemies if theres like a lvl gap between you unless they que up as a premade with a higher level guy in their party which is a problem at the end of the day
Overwatch,not_removed,this has been my experience for the last few days i usually get stuck with at least one or two sub while the enemy team gets stacked with mostly most games it seems that if i go down well just straight up lose the objectivegame even if i took enemies with me im tired of having to carry the ever loving hell out of every game just to have a chance at winning
Overwatch,not_removed,i was under the impression that matchmaking will be implemented only on ranked games am i wrong
Overwatch,not_removed,hi im trying to elaborate on how the match making system works in this video it might be a bit scientific talking about algorithms and variables but you might get an understanding on how it works
Overwatch,not_removed,on top of this id like to add that what ive found at least nobody plays the correct hero ill play a game with genji mccrees a widowmaker and a torbjorn leaving me to play support and leaving us without a tank this happens all too often which in turn has made my most used hero mercy with hours played out of my total hours of playtime
Overwatch,not_removed,i agree matches that are well balanced are rare it typically is you get destroyed or destroy the other team no balance
Overwatch,not_removed,i have actually proven to myself that matchmaking is completely broken i am only level no star or anything my team is all below level sure you can use the mmr argument but it doesnt make any sense every game i get placed with at least one star on the enemy team and they completely steam roll my team as if we were bots to them so it obviously isnt mmr if i get steam rolled every game by people that play this game and already have a star and are my level doesnt make sense to me whatsoever all of my friends and people i play with say the same thing too i am actually no longer going to be playing overwatch until matchmaking is fixed as i dont have fun losing every game i play
Overwatch,not_removed,theres a lot of cognitive bias in this thread people are claiming that the majority of matches they play are stomps one way or the other i seriously doubt this and heres why unless youre actually keeping track of every game you play the ones that arent stomps will all blend together because theyre not very memorable games where there is absolute domination stand out from the crowd and so theyre the ones that you remember now im not saying that yall are straight up wrong but youve got to be aware that everyone and i mean everyone is going to suffer from this sort of bias
Overwatch,not_removed,my very first game after the beta i landed in a team with the minimum player being at rank and highest was although i did play the beta but only to rank you could just base a the matchmaking on rank average points per minute kill death ratio plus assist with just those you should be able to match up decently
Overwatch,not_removed,while level difference can be a disadvantage assuming the only difference is they played the game longer and so are more connected with various heroes and know the maps it is nowhere near as frustrating as the matchmaking being broken in the very basics like pairing with people on a completely different level skillwise it happens to me very often that i get paired with people that go on a player kill streak while my max is like and average i hope the game is still averaging the skill levels and will get better but this is not fun loosing of matches isnt fun and fun is why we play games if they cant get the matchmaking system to work better i dont see a point in playing unless im a sadistic psychopath who likes game of thrones and wants to reenact it on himself didnt even mention the fact that literally of people ive been matched with play for themselves not like a team at all so of time im forced to pick mercy cuz kids be kids and want to play offense chars even on a defense map which is fun but i want to play something else sometimes as well
Overwatch,not_removed,my teams highest rank was something the enemy teams lowest rank was
Overwatch,not_removed,so this is result ive got a lot of gold medals during precompetitive play and ive lost of games just because of team so as result i have terrible rank now game are trying to balance me for winrate does this means that ive just lost my chance for highskilled games because of matchmaking and cant up my level because of winrate last week i just want to get cashback for overwatch
Overwatch,not_removed,its the worse mm system i have ever encountered its utterly disgusting and pathetic the way its functioning
Overwatch,not_removed,the competitive matchmaking is really bad i get golds in eliminations and damage done almost all the time and did so in all my placement matches but because i only won games i have to be punished with a rank when it was it was my team who had the problems and i was being matched against full groups matchmaking is based off how well you as a player do why isnt it like that
Overwatch,not_removed,i was grouping up with a bunch of people and they were a much higher level than i was so when i left the group and went back into quick play im getting matched up with people way out of my skill range im always the noob on every team because of this ugh
Overwatch,not_removed,rigging games in sports is illegal why should it be ok with games let players lose games in a row it not fare to the other team
Overwatch,not_removed,i have the issue that when i play with a friend we get put with people way better than us of the time and i feel like i actually do better with solo but it still bad a lot of the time
Overwatch,not_removed,actually in every skill based shooter i have played since cs first playing against better people seems dull and stupid but it is a good way to learn and get rly good now overwatch rank with only in the game and csgo global elite
Overwatch,not_removed,ive been in a game that started with on yet been in games that disband because of on id be more than happy to start a game of on but the matchmaking doesnt want to yet will start a v had many games disband after v cant find one more player yet i can wait for minutes searching for a game alone get dcd for a miscellaneous reason and attempt to rejoin my friends also because i was dcd i have to rerequest an invite to join their group again which can be annoying for them to have to do as theyre now busy in the middle of the game by which time the game has found someone already and im forced to spectate the time estimations whilst matchmaking are comically bad and it seems as though if it is recommended to reset your search after it drags on excessively surely they could code it to do it itself its not just me have people i play with and they all are experiencing the same frustrations
Overwatch,not_removed,i love working my way up to with friends then trying out solo q looping from to about times then getting mass deranked to all because my teammates are egotistical idiots what kind of system is this carrying is nearly impossible in a game like this so its only natural that i would be the underdog team games in a row haha fuck overwatch
Overwatch,not_removed,blizzard absolutely sucks with group match making since hots
Overwatch,not_removed,
Overwatch,not_removed,just had a game where they had one lvl and all the others were and my team were a lvl lvl another level i cant remember but i think it was around a level and me the thing is these matchmakings are also happening in competitive not as much with levels but especially with how good some people are
Overwatch,not_removed,level doesnt matter its a separate elo rating they use for matchmaking for example if you are level but play like a level you shouldnt be matched against other level ≠ skill
Overwatch,not_removed,yeah that is stupid af
Overwatch,not_removed,perception bias is pretty common in pvp games like this how do you win at overwatch by making other people lose you notice games that feel especially painful or when number discrepancies like the level system are glaringly obvious but the average win rate is expected to be ive been on almost as many losing streaks as win streaks you will lose games and sometimes its because someone on their team got in a groove and played better than you thought out their actions more communicated better than you my personal advice is look to improve yourself first you cant possibly believe youre already playing perfectly accept that losing is a part of playing too and learn from it
Overwatch,not_removed,im put this out there for people but the game doesnt force you to have a win rate of the issues i see with people losing are a basic misunderstanding of how this game works there is no set meta that is key to winning people run around complaining about tanks and healers but ultimately it doesnt matter whatever strat is used theres a counter for it if people arent able to counter it or dont know how the team with the better strat wins or more often than naught the team unwilling to change champions loses some maps favor some champs over others route for example starts out next to a cliff giving knockback champs like lucio and pharah an advantage if they force the enemy team to move on the outside this can be done by placing bastionturret at the top of the boxcar ramp on the wall side now if no one adapts to take out that bastion and the team is forced to the outside the team with the better knockback champs will have the advantage unless you have a sniper or someone to take out the turret so you can go up wall side the problem a lot of people have is they look at the levels as some sort of advantage but there is none expect experience every map and every champ has stayed the same but people refuse to learn how the game works or learn from their mistakes next time youre losing once you revive take a second and look at the map indicators of where your team mates are if youre losing theres a good chance theyre running in one at a time constantly pushing through the same choke point or your team comp is trumped by the enemies for that map the first thing people do is jump on people not playing tanks or supports but every champ has a counter so even if you have a reinhardtmercy combo a junkrat that circle behind your team and pelts you from behind will bring down your defense and if the junkrats team is situationally aware theyll apply pressure from the other side at the same time negating any tanking that reinhardt can do mercy is countered by aoe damage reinhardt is countered by pincer attacks snipers are countered by reapers and anyone able to circle to the back line turrets are countered by snipers recognizing these threats and how to counter them based on the map youre playing is the difference between good players and bad good players will recognize this sooner while bads will reach level and still not understand it strippy pc so level doesnt have anything to do with it and if youre playing with friends new to the game then you should teach them or coach them pick champs theyre comfortable with and you pick ones that compliment them then perform the strat thats best for your combo
Overwatch,not_removed,guys i understand this predicament you have with the matchmaking but the game has been out a week some people are probably literally getting the game like yesterday or today not everyone gets the game on day one so expect some level discrepancies for a while also some people havent put hours in a game that has been out a week and thats okay im sure mm will level itself out down the road
Overwatch,not_removed,when op dont know what mmr is
Overwatch,not_removed,this is exactly the same for me
Overwatch,not_removed,i have hours in the game and i have wins not bad right actually my record is i think i just have intensely bad luck mainly because more than half of my losses have been with a team who didnt know how the essentials of playing the game but thats to be expected right im still level and so its to be expected that the people in the game with me are bad right wrong my teams who keep going in one or two at a time keep getting shredded by teams who had knowledge of the basics and used my teams lack thereof against us youd think that would help by giving me better allies andor worse enemies but it becomes a problem when my chance of losing increases with each loss and increases with each win across the ptr and the american servers i have been on the losing end of competitive matches with no wins one match the enemies were around my level and the allies were quite higher levels one of them was level prestige two of them were around and the other two were at the very least levels higher than me i have never lost harder and if youre about to toss up the play with parties that have similar or higher experience than you solution i cant because i technically dont have friends i know my brothers large friend group well as theyve got or more years on me but theres so many of them that my level brother is either playing with a full party or just with me makes it harder to regulate my game plan right away since being with him doesnt fix the problem and while i do know people who play the game i dont know how often they do so what level they are if theyll even go in with me if they play on pc or what their usernames are also if its harder to go places and meet new people anywhere as opposed where i live id like to hear it flemington nj is probably the place with the least gamers making me and my interest more unique than snowflakes did i mention my parents wont let me go far away without weeks planning sorry for the long comment its easier than having to deal with these suggestions later also this way the first solution someone can think of will be closer to the right one
Overwatch,not_removed,the system basically forces you closer to bingo i started the holiday weekend at and tanked all the way down to on the back of a frustrating loss streak towards the end i was getting paired up with people who literally did not understand core game mechanics like capping control points overtime etc and they would just sit in spawn arguing in chat this little span revealed how absolutely frustrating it can be to close out games in overwatch when youre literally carrying players that can be accurately described as a sack of potatoes if you happen to die near the end of a game with these types of players youve basically just guaranteed a loss because they certainly wont rush the payload to force ot and they certainly wont shoot the goddamn mercy flying in for a man rez
Overwatch,not_removed,actually this might be what happened for me too i had an extreme winning streak when game launched won the first games then slowly dropped from to i maintained at win rate for days then it crashed every game from then on no one played support and tanks cant be mmr right also to note i often get at least gold medals as any hero my win rate dropped from to then now its and has stayed there
Overwatch,not_removed,yeah a win rate should be a result of teams of equal skill and performance going head to head not alternating curb stomping and steamrolling
Overwatch,not_removed,this has been happening regularly to me since towards the end of open beta they kept the mmr ratings from beta but erased all the unlocks which makes achievement hunting for achievements you already got in open beta a bitch btw by now everyone i go up against knows how to dodge all the ults something people with mmr dont know how to do if i start to get too many wins it just gives me worse and worse teammates people who wont listen trolls people who think its okay to not have a tank people who refuse to play anything but offensive heroes but couldnt kill their way out of a paper bag
Overwatch,not_removed,it should do that by giving you better or worse competition not handicapping you with terrible teammates or boosting you with godlike ones its just really frustrating and made for the first bad time ive had playing this game i mean thats exactly what its doing youre somebody elses competition too i get that its frustrating but this is just how mmr works in pretty much any game the reality is that you are an inconsistent player and so are most of the people at your skill level mine too if youre curious im guilty of literally the same complaints as you sometimes when im frustrated
Overwatch,not_removed,yep i encounterd the same i had a winrate on sunday and yesterday i lost almost all my games maybe it was just bad luck or there trying to hard to get you at a winrate
Overwatch,not_removed,im so glad to hear this isnt must me prior to this weekend i was at games over im now games under and its been just horrible to try and play for the last few days i thought i was losing my damn mind
Overwatch,not_removed,ok then so what is the matchmaking based on to me it appears to be completely random
Overwatch,not_removed,i have played a number of fps games that do not have the level of matchmaking problems that overwatch has cod and the halo franchise there is something objectively wrong with the way the matchmaking system works in this game
Overwatch,not_removed,you dont actually know this for sure youre guessing matchmaking in their other games factors level as well as mmr into the equation
Overwatch,not_removed,i started playing last night with a friend who was at level and frankly isnt that great at fps games for a few reasons whilst the average level of the people i was playing didnt drop i noticed they were definitely worse than my usual opponents so this is just anecdotal but until we can see some sort of actual ranking data i believe the game aims for a happy medium between the teams skill levels
Overwatch,not_removed,well whether it does or not it clearly represents experience our top level players shouldnt be outleveled by nearly the entire team
Overwatch,not_removed,exactly i feel like im being punished for doing well it feels like the game is rigged against the good players i play a lot of mercy and its a toss up between completely brain dead new players and amazing players who will protect me
Overwatch,not_removed,when you join a game that is in progress it does not count as a loss you actually get additional xp
Overwatch,not_removed,whenever you join midgame its usually a bad sign
Overwatch,not_removed,its not their fault they were matched with you no need to be rude to them
Overwatch,not_removed,i have the same issue right after i hit lv i end up in groups with levels my team and the enemy team this killed the fun for me im not good enough to play against them i thought the mmr would choose players around my skill level
Overwatch,not_removed,always the worst player bitching at people i notice i feel for you i had an attack bastion that would fling themselves at the enemy like they were a tank spent the whole game complaining about my reaper play i got potg
Overwatch,not_removed,healer is a thankless job
Overwatch,not_removed,yes why would you think theyd just group people at random even in quick play
Overwatch,not_removed,yup i was playing a match where we were about to win the suddenly our rein decided to be pharah and we lost what
Overwatch,not_removed,i decided to take some notes on a day of play because i thought cognitive bias might be playing a role of payload games games involved the payload not advancing to the first point at all pushed from start to finish without every stopping died out in a short overtime about halfway though ended in a bitter overtime at the last point game involved literally no one touching the cart numbani and was fought to a bitter overtime at the very start of the map yes i somehow ended up playing payload in a row i dont even know how so yeah stomps are more common than not for me so far
Overwatch,not_removed,im with you on this i have about hours played wins win rate my first four games were total roflstomps where i went on kill streaks on most lives i assumed matchmaking was moving me up the ranks and expected an overcorrection and i got it total stomps all huge losses no kill streaks and no cards things have been smooth since i rarely winlose more than games in a row which im acutely aware of because i go on tilt bad when im on a losing streak ill turn the game off if i lose three in a row otherwise ill just keep losing edit i forgot i pulled this thread up in a google search not on the frontpage sorry for the zombie comment
Overwatch,not_removed,where absolute domination is the norm no it does not stand out of the crowd it is the crowd it is absolutely the crowd evenly matched games are rarer in this game and that makes them more memorable i remember every evenly matched game ive had before i had to stop playing but to say that people arent paying attention to the games theyre in is wrong to tell people that theres bias is wrong specially when its not said what the bias is in favor of yes there is a problem with matchmaking
Overwatch,not_removed,while level difference can be a disadvantage level doesnt matter a level could have spent hours per champ playing each champ or one champ for hours it doesnt matter as an example theres a level that runs around by the name of strippy that plays widowmaker almost exclusively but cant get more than kills per game and if hes hard countered he wont change champs i get paired with people that go on a player kill streak while my max is like some people play more aggressively than others someone who never dies in a match might be considered good until you look at his overall performance and see that hes never in any of the team fights someone may have a kill streak going on but thats likely because hes getting away with whatever tactic hes using there will always be a way to cheese numbers at the expense of your teams winloss of time im forced to pick mercy cuz kids be kids and want to play offense chars even on a defense map youre not forced to play anything every map every lineup every champ has a counter think about this for a second mercy can only heal one person or boost damage on one person so shes effectively a man team shes with someone or useless alone so if she goes in as a man team with whoever shes healing against another man team thats both dps if the dps work together and focus the same target shell lose out especially if they focus her and her ult while clutch can be countered by a variety of other ults tire barrage blizzard so to believe there is any set meta is the incorrect line of thought in regards to this game theres a counter for everything but just because that counter exists it doesnt mean it will always work snipers counter bastion but if your sniper sucks at the game or doesnt realize they need to clear out the bastion it wont work
Overwatch,not_removed,but this doesnt hold in all situations i just had a game where the enemy team had lvl in group we had in group and one of them was lvl some other guy was lvl im lvl not even remotely balanced how can the game estimate that a group of lvl lvl lvl and lvl can compete with players no just no
Overwatch,not_removed,if the win rate is supposed to be how is anybody supposed to move up or down ranks your argument makes zero sense
Overwatch,not_removed,wich explains why this games a piece of crap in my eyes its an unfunny version of fortress gg blizzard
Overwatch,not_removed,see youre wrong because the vast majority have decided that there is a meta so knowing that your enemy team is going to adhere loosely to the established meta you have a relatively narrow range of team configurations that will counter it the meta creates the meta
Overwatch,not_removed,maybe it was just bad luck so it could be bad luck losing games but it couldnt be a good luck whats happened on sunday system doesnt try hard for anything if you win a lot of games and goes on a streak game will obviously match you up with better opponents thats what it supposed to do if you beat those opponents you might really be improving if you lose it means you just had a lucky streak and you are on the down slope at the moment
Overwatch,not_removed,nah man check put the overwatch forums the most discussed post right now is about this topic
Overwatch,not_removed,fuck same here was around the to win rate then i actually had a game loss streak the teams where just the worst not bad people but just well bad at the game bad like they are really new to fps really not that fun seriously considering just not playing anymore till they address the match making issues i also miss having my own server had a server and just had a great bunch of guys keep comming back would be nice to run our own games
Overwatch,not_removed,it says its based on similar skill groups but given that im constantly matched with morons i doubt thats true often matched with people way higher than myself i am level and recently been joining level games with the occasional level or something
Overwatch,not_removed,theres probably some kind of mmr system like most games use
Overwatch,not_removed,there is some level of consistency though when i play by myself i find the games much harder than with my friends
Overwatch,not_removed,based on the best they can do to keep your winloss ratio at thats all that matters thats all the system does
Overwatch,not_removed,
Overwatch,not_removed,oh absolutely overwatch is actually quite good at matching skill levels between teams believe it or not and im sure it tries to compensate for brandnew players by assuming that theyre pretty bad
Overwatch,not_removed,well obviously if your friend was level then his mmr rating was incredibly low until he has quite a few games in i think it is safe to assume that mmr in overwatch is based on wins like in other games right now i am level playing against level and since i have a high win percentage i assume if it continues then i will be playing with higher level players on average
Overwatch,not_removed,remember that the lowlevel players on the enemy team might have gotten where they were because theyve been doing exceptionally well for their level or because the highlevel players on your team might have been doing exceptionally poorly for their level theres some hidden mmr underneath that is sorting these groups in one way or another
Overwatch,not_removed,so if i join a game and see defeat roll across my screen before i have chance to pick a hero it doesnt count as a loss if thats the case when i join a game as a ringer and manage to make a difference does the victory not count too i wish blizzard released more information about their system
Overwatch,not_removed,its sad how true that is
Overwatch,not_removed,because i have like every games if im lucky where the matches are equally skilled on both teams and have prolonged fights thats why im under the impression that matchmaking will be on implemented on ranked blizzard also mentioned that ranked was delayed because they wanted to fix the matchmaking code
Overwatch,not_removed,even worse is when your only healer switches out min in without anyone noticing
Overwatch,not_removed,first this thread is a month old double check yourself before doing something silly second means above meaning a net gain of wins third my point was that a player notices and gets focused on a losing streak much much easier than when he wins in a row and a win ratio is just that too a ratio on a sample size of games played play matches a day and of course the bad games stick with your memory then sometimes you just cant hit that genji for the life of you and sometimes you feel like your roadhog hooks are more forgiving than the pope
Overwatch,not_removed,and the pet system in wow is a crap version of pokemon if you dont like it dont play it it should be understood by this point that blizzard doesnt bow to the individual it does it to the majority gg profits
Overwatch,not_removed,were talking about two different metas the rockpaperscissors of the game countering meta is different than saying that each game requires sniper tanks healers and flanker because the maps change and the comps change that role meta changes so there is no set meta youre right but in a way that has nothing to do with what im talking about
Overwatch,not_removed,the game doesnt match you up with better opponents they still the same get outaimed and shat on the bad part is that suddenly my mates start becoming some hawkins at one point you get back to the rate again and your mates suddenly arent useless pieces of shit anymore this games matchmaking is a big fucking joke nothing else its supposed to match you against better players with increasing win rates just as your mates which shouldbe equally performing as you do but infact whenever i check out the retards i end up seeing sub winrates where the matchmaking obviously tries to drag them up by throwing me in there and drag me down by throwing the idiots into my team
Overwatch,not_removed,yup having this exact issue right now at times im literally a god player kills in a game with an offensive character then next game its like i cant even get over kills and it crazy in comparison you go from being godlike to being shat on by other godlike players haha there is definitely people in these teams that stand out above the rest but the system is bringing me down all the time win lose rinse repeat sad really
Overwatch,not_removed,i know exactly how you feel im lvl get grouped with people who are lvl and the other team lvl and how the hell is that similar hint its not there is no way that the mmr on the levels are the same as the level on my team i constantly feel like im carrying my team ill have gold and a silver and we still lose because you know the level is going to have any clue how to shut down the level or ill heal and nobody kills anything or ill tank and the healer goes to heal the sniper instead of me its crazy the only way its even remotely enjoyable is if you have a full team
Overwatch,not_removed,fanboys are downvoting us for speaking ill of the matchmaking system but it is actually pretty bad its bad in heroes of the storm so im not surprised most games i play are stomps sometimes my team dominates and sometimes we get dominated but close games are very rare
Overwatch,not_removed,where does it say that im trying to find any evidence blizzard has ever illuminated how the system works
Overwatch,not_removed,but given that im constantly matched with morons i doubt thats true might be truer than you think bruv
Overwatch,not_removed,yes probably but their other game heroes of the storm use an mmr based matchmaking system and it is nutoriously bad its a lot of randomness involved
Overwatch,not_removed,this tweet has nothing to do with whether or not they factor level into matchmaking they are saying that your level does not necessarily correlate to your skill level
Overwatch,not_removed,yeah its been pretty good and my only issue with it so far is that its finally decided im good enough that i have to work for my wins now no more stomping randoms the salt levels have dropped though which is good
Overwatch,not_removed,its probably not based entirely on wins since that is another stat that mostly just shows how much you play the game like you mentioned later in the comment win would be the more likely stat theyd use edit more likely out of the two mentioned
Overwatch,not_removed,everything you say is right but i wonder if having a very visible level thats almost irrelevant and a very invisible matchmaking rank that actually matters was the best choice on blizzards part it gives players the wrong idea
Overwatch,not_removed,neither counts as a win or a loss they could have been more transparent about it
Overwatch,not_removed,well the matchmaking cant be good this early and where did they say that ive only heard they wanted to fix competitive mode not the matchmaking specifically
Overwatch,not_removed,matchmaking remains flawed so the age of this thread is irrelevant
Overwatch,not_removed,sounds like a solo q nightmare really
Overwatch,not_removed,yesterday i jumped on and i found that the matchmaking had some pretty bad issues the first game i joined we got smashed and i mean like rolled up in a blanket and used as a punching bag smashed the next game my team did the smashing the enemy couldnt move the objective more than feet from their base the next game it was reversed again and that went on and on till i got bored there was maybe one match that i had where both sides had to work but that was only after i grouped up with some friends
Overwatch,not_removed,fanboys are downvoting us for speaking ill of the matchmaking system nope i just downvote people who think so highly of themselves that everyone in their team are morons besides them newsflash you are not that better than your teammates everyone have their offgames i had lots of close game already btw stomps are rare for me definitely
Overwatch,not_removed,where does it say what could you be a little more specific please
Overwatch,not_removed,if it was completely random it would be way worse
Overwatch,not_removed,there is no randomness to it at all the only time an mmr system has ever messed up is in higher tiers where there are less players right now its taking your average mmr and putting you against a team that has around the same average mmr level skill
Overwatch,not_removed,still better than leagues one
Overwatch,not_removed,my friends are pretty newbie so thats probably why in my solo games people actually coordinate ults and move generally together but not so much in group games
Overwatch,not_removed,really dude nothing to do with it thats pretty clear pr speak for levels arent how were doing matchmaking but go ahead and be obtuse while arguing with me over a three day old post
Overwatch,not_removed,its always hard to sort new players because all the game has to go on is a blank slate when theyre still level or the games still only got a few things to go on so its an imperfect approximation of where they should sit its unfortunate but theres always a certain risk of onesidedness when theres a lack of matchmaking info
Overwatch,not_removed,ok you have a huge misunderstanding first of all as many other have already said time spent doesnt equal to skill level in any way secondly this statement im replying to doesnt make any sense at all mmr systems try to find your skill level they have a level of certainty about your skill which is the lowest for the new players this helps people on the far end of the skill meter top players and the worst ones it makes them find their skill group quicker imagine if someone like seagull bought a new account he will probably be on a streak immediately according to you game should say at this point well he still doesnt have enough experience let him stomp a few hours more fortunately game doesnt to that and matches him to better opponents again and again as he wins his matches the point is if you also go on a winning streak game doesnt have a way to tell you are not seagull and you will be treated the same until you start to lose and placed into according skill bracket obviously teaming up with players with high uncertainty level will have wildly unexpected matchups because thats how it works if you have waited through a few matches you would get more suited matchups a player who just bought the game will never be put up against someone who has hours immediately if he queues solo but if he queues with other people you might never know because matchmaker might think that other people can carry him
Overwatch,not_removed,i dont have a link but i read it in sites that the fix was about the matchmaking on competitive i dont see another reason for fixing something else in competitive maybe someone else knows something more that can contribute
Overwatch,not_removed,posting in a thread that has been dead for a month is certainly not the way to get your concerns noticed i am guaranteed the only person reading your responses to this one person wont make this bump up
Overwatch,not_removed,this is exactly how all my games go at i win match and then i get reinstanced get roflstompd so i leave win another match then get reinstanced and get rofl stomped im starting to think the mm does this shit on purpose all i know is its getting fucking old ive been going against level players since level i guess blizzard just doesnt want people winning to frequently otherwise that would mean their match maker or a premade team issue would surface and no the teams rarely ever shuffle for me in my games instead of reshuffling the teams when i win they boot me out of the game entirely and put me with a bunch of dumbasses i have a strong back but not strong enough to carry hopeless retards who dont know which classes to choose on certain maps
Overwatch,not_removed,so then you guys took turns beating up on each other sounds to me like both teams were better at one side so the team that was on that side won your experience doesnt seem to be about matchmaking
Overwatch,not_removed,its not really about skill you can generally tell theyre morons by the third sniper pick
Overwatch,not_removed,i have definitely experienced the ptfo everyone on my team sucks but me rushing alone into prepared defences people
Overwatch,not_removed,cool link me a source with details on the overwatch matchmaker
Overwatch,not_removed,unless you are masterchallenger then no stop bitching about dynamic q when it literally does not affect anything under that besides premades youre trying to circlejerk a dead horse its dead creep
Overwatch,not_removed,they are clearly saying your level does not correlate to skill in the game i have no idea where youre getting anything about matchmaking from this tweet
Overwatch,not_removed,they took down the competitive mode to address a couple of issues the player base pointed out during the closed beta this has nothing todo with the actual matchmaking
Overwatch,not_removed,in my experience what happens here is one or two people who clearly outmatch the majority of players in both teams get swapped around teams after a few ragequits which causes the shift in stomping of the games i play are stomps shifting from losseswins after a team mixup and it gets old so fast
Overwatch,not_removed,nah i completely left the game after each round so i was joining new games with balance each time
Overwatch,not_removed,i always thought this was an exaggeration i really never saw sniper picked at the same time and probably less than times i saw a double sniper in hours ive put in since release to be honest i saw more double torbjorns than double snipers though
Overwatch,not_removed,i dont quite get what you are asking are you asking me for proof that they use an mmr system or do you just want general details if so here is a blog post posted by blizzard called competitive play preview
Overwatch,not_removed,because the customers complaint was about matchmaking
Overwatch,not_removed,the common mmr system in many competitive games is based on winning and losing and that alone it should be the only stat to look at when matchmaking because it will seed the most competitive games this system takes time to get players to the rating they should be at so the matchmaking can work appropriately the game hasent been out long enough to criticize the matchmaking it will get better overtime
Overwatch,not_removed,maybe i misread something but i thought the issue was about not matchmaking correctly ppl on the same ranks but then again im not certain because i played beta on consoles where there was no ranked plays
Overwatch,not_removed,in my last match i was stuck with widow makers and a hanzo along with a torb pick on attack
Overwatch,not_removed,the former yes i am not convinced that theres an mmr system in place in quickmatch what you linked however is for competetive mode which is completely irrelevant
Overwatch,not_removed,specifically he was complaining about the average level of the other players in his game compared to him and his partymate which is why they said level does not equal skill level meaning people can be low level and still be good or as good as a higher level player so he should give them a chance this tweet has nothing to do with how blizzards matchmaking actually works
Overwatch,not_removed,they took the ranked mode down because of feedback from the community all the complaints were about how the ladder works not with the actually matchmaking system
Overwatch,not_removed,do you play on pc or console sometimes i wonder when i hear people complaining about shit teams if they are playing on console or not because i dont see these things happen to me that often and i play on pc
Overwatch,not_removed,so just like op the twitter guy complains that hes getting matched with players who are nowhere near his level and blizzard says that account level has nothing to do with skill and i tell this guy that matchmaking is not based on account level but this is clearly a massive fucking leap of logic thats akin to me just guessing sure this is clearly worth an argument
Overwatch,not_removed,ladder as in progression levelling
Overwatch,not_removed,these things happen on pc every third match seems like youre just ridiculously lucky
Overwatch,not_removed,nice flamepost bro but i just wanted a source on all the claims you made i dont suck at the game but thanks for the being so considerate
Overwatch,not_removed,since its been two days you should come back and reread this post of yours and ask yourself was acting this really necessary
Overwatch,not_removed,i dont know how you can not understand something you just wrote and blizzard says that account level has nothing to do with skill and i tell this guy that matchmaking is not based on account level these two points are non sequitar so yes what you said is a guess it may be a slightly educated guess but still a guess the tweet does not confirm what you said and unless you work at blizzard or have another source where they confirm what you originally posted it will always be a guess
Overwatch,not_removed,like how lol has bronze silver gold and you can rank up between those and stuff there were huge problems with their system
Overwatch,not_removed,of my past games on pc had more than snipers and these were totally different groups of people level by the way matches against prestige
Overwatch,not_removed,or maybe im in a higher mmr bracket where people dont generally do this
Overwatch,not_removed,pretty sure im at a quite decent mmr myself and it happens throughout from the start to being in hours now
Overwatch,not_removed,generally when i lose a game its because of poor coordination and not so much people picking multiple of the same hero i do try to team lead when i get into a game guiding people on who should switch heroes and boost morale to win etc
Overwatch,not_removed,keep in mind that hes trading in his ability to headshot and have smaller spread to his cannon in order to get that dr
Overwatch,not_removed,no geoff specifically talked about bastion becoming a tankbuster
Overwatch,not_removed,just because of the buff doesnt mean theyre trying to make sombra a must pick it just means that shes going to be more viable to counter bastion than she was
Overwatch,not_removed,problem being the only way to make something a tank buster is to give it massive reliable damage ya know else dies to massive damage everything
Overwatch,not_removed,and how does that mean it wasnt intended to help out sombra i mean blizzard isnt stupid the know full well that it would greatly increase the value of sombra just because he is becoming a tank buster doesnt mean sombra was not part of the equation
Overwatch,not_removed,except bastion got much larger spread and no headshots meaning hes more suited to taking out big targets and barriers instead of being a dps hose at everything
Overwatch,not_removed,with the increased bullet spread and no headshot nerf bastion has been given damaging nontanks from long range is anything but reliable
Overwatch,not_removed,have you played the ptr he still melts everything he aims at pretty friggin quick
Overwatch,not_removed,um have you played the ptr his damage is still huge against nontank targets the only difference here is that he cant do it at very long ranges which was never even an issue in the first place
Overwatch,not_removed,not the point you claim the only way to make something a tank buster is to give it massive reliable damage which is not true bastion has become a tank buster by being given a more specialised role via increased spread and no headshots much more of a specific purpose than his current role
Overwatch,not_removed,the bnet launcher itself takes a lot of frames away so close that whenever you play overwatch you can close other things like nvidia shadowplay and the nvidia experience from your task manager and that may also help
Overwatch,not_removed,try changing priority to high
Overwatch,not_removed,you want to open the task manager while overwatch is running click the details tab and right click on the overwatchexe process there should be an option to change the priority there ive heard this works for other people
Overwatch,not_removed,dont rejoin that fast leave and wait a few minutes you kinda brought it on yourself
Overwatch,not_removed,oh no i left my game and left my teammates at a disadvantage and now i have a leaver penalty ffs some people these days
Overwatch,not_removed,wow how much did that suck for your team being down a dude just cuz he didnt want to play but knew the risk next time play another mode for match itll give you enough time
Overwatch,not_removed,embrace the tranquility
Overwatch,not_removed,this
Overwatch,not_removed,wow its brawl so dumb logic
Overwatch,not_removed,well why dont you go play a nice game of hide and go fuck yourself
Overwatch,not_removed,well blizzard should fix this pos game to prevent people from rejoining a match that they obviously dont want to play or maybe fix it so you dont get shoved into the same fucking gametype fucking times in a row
Overwatch,not_removed,nah id probably get the same map for the time in a row cant handle those unfair penalty games
Overwatch,not_removed,or you could just not leave
Overwatch,not_removed,you were shoved in there because you furiously rejoined not because you were super unlucky with the rng you kinda ruined one game for potentially other people so you kinda deserve this next time just wait a minute until you join again
Overwatch,not_removed,like everyone else said wait longer thats what you get when you leave and try and search again that fast sucks to suck
Overwatch,not_removed,its a random playlist not a sorry try again playlist
Overwatch,not_removed,i think something is wrong on their end i cant even connect to the servers
Overwatch,not_removed,probably patch going live server side
Overwatch,not_removed,i have done almost everything that should fix these types of things but none of them are helping
Overwatch,not_removed,but some people i know are playing overwatch without even disconnecting right now
Overwatch,not_removed,i hope so
Overwatch,not_removed,i love playing solo and i do not feel that i am having a poor experience i would also go as far to say that playing solo does make you more self aware to a certain extend i think playing with friends has its benefits so does playing solo
Overwatch,not_removed,absolutely to each his own always i love a good solo round now and again i have simply seen many people complaining about their solo experience and wanted to provide knowledge of a potential option to resolve that issue
Overwatch,not_removed,ana is atm the best hero in the game reinhardt is meta to have on almost every map less so on koth maps but he works there too you shouldnt be expecting nerfs to him he is in a good spot junkrat is not really that good let me explain why he has absurd damage output but its hard to finish off kills with him since your main job is to spam a corner or entry point and keep the enemy away like that if you just hit people without killing them it just build enemy support ults thats why you need your team to follow up on your trash damage
Overwatch,not_removed,you can buy the new things with it what are you talking about
Overwatch,not_removed,event skins
Overwatch,not_removed,obviously the goal is to reach the hardcap and then post on some sort of forum asking why you cant get more
Overwatch,not_removed,im not sure what you mean by almost none of the new things can be bought with it unless youre talking about event items but if you own all the default stuff any duplicates you unlock from loot boxes will give you gold and you can save that for when they inevitably release more itemsanother event
Overwatch,not_removed,those new things and the special chests they come in are event specific so just wait a little bit for the next event then you can try to buy a whole slew of new shinies
Overwatch,not_removed,maybe the skins get purchasable again when the event circles back round if not then the best thing to do is stockpile currency and buy them all on the last day of each event going forward
Overwatch,not_removed,make a smurf and get mad every time you open a loot box
Overwatch,not_removed,halloween skins christmas skins
Overwatch,not_removed,oh yeah but you can buy event skimds during the event so thats a moot point
Overwatch,not_removed,right so stockpile the currency buy event skins maybe the ones you missed over the last year get put back on sale during the event
Overwatch,not_removed,yeah exactly i think after a while blizz should add multiple gun skins that you can buy with normal money instead of comp points
Overwatch,not_removed,sombra ultimate removes shields iirc
Overwatch,not_removed,flankers for the gen sombra could work like gentlemencake said and dps for the rest
Overwatch,not_removed,pick sombra or dva
Overwatch,not_removed,counter each of them its tough because for the shield gen you need a flanker and flankers easily get spotted by the turret you can sombra your way to the shield gen or you rush as tracer and bomb it to hell have some high damage per hit like pharah to immediately strip enemies off armor
Overwatch,not_removed,go after the shield gen first as overs have suggested pick sombra for this job once its down your team needs to up the damage output to strip them of armor you dont nessessarily need kills just to remove everyones armor and drain torb of his scrap
Overwatch,not_removed,sombra and dva push to the point sombra removes shields and dva breaks their line they have to split up to take her out dva just stalls and escapes if possible to meet up with team she doesnt engage targets
Overwatch,not_removed,this happens usually when you queue into a game while watching a highlight video camera seems stuck then in killfeed and potg
Overwatch,not_removed,wonder what the potg would been like
Overwatch,not_removed,i had the same thing
Overwatch,not_removed,ah yes the usual reddit suggestion thread that will go nowhere because it show how new you are at the game
Overwatch,not_removed,its easily countered if youre prepared
Overwatch,not_removed,
Overwatch,not_removed,prepared this hero awareness try it
Overwatch,not_removed,and of course my half assed bantz about you being new aside zarya is a balance hero as she is right now the only reason that she could graviton and kill everyone is if she is fully charge which begs the question of why did she get fully charge graviton by itself does scratch damage at best and it is just long enough for everyone to either get kill by another ult or survive because of another ult and even then an extra ammo usage does not really fit well considering all other ults never consume any ammo either not to mention that overall it is not a significant change at all just more hassle to deal with and shes already a high skill floorceiling character to begin with
Overwatch,not_removed,i do i see a zarya i save my transcendence i hide in the back with my rez i keep my ice wall ready to use without awareness to enemy abilities youll lose
Overwatch,not_removed,mccrees ulti consumes ammo and he shoots zarya shoots a blob and it doesnt consume ammo
Overwatch,not_removed,yo bro zarya is getting nerfed on ptr right now and she is picked almost every match in esports
Overwatch,not_removed,i was referring to op
Overwatch,not_removed,and what exactly is that change going to affect zarya outside of an extra second of reload of course a second in this kind of game is already a long time but this is not a balance tweak as much as just putting more hassle into other players just because someone else think that so and so needs tweaknerf because they are op
Overwatch,not_removed,oh i just woke up when i responding wasnt sure if it was directed at me or not im sorry im glad you agree then ☺️ hope you have a wonderful day btw
Overwatch,not_removed,tbh itd piss me off zarya takes forever to reload also her ult is lowkey trash by itself maybe a third or fourth of the time i or any other zarya in my game uses it she gets killed or kills no one unless shes setting up a wombo combo but have a hidden mercy her ult charges faster than zaryas and its a waste of ults anyways
Overwatch,not_removed,mei is also on the rise in pc shes pretty good now
Overwatch,not_removed,ive noticed this on xbox she is basically filling dvas role with better long range damage her ult recovers so fast now and is so useful in any situation that she is a default pick her ice sickle attack body damage needs to be less but keep the hs the same also her ult meter needs about more due to her constant ability to damage heal
Overwatch,not_removed,mei is in every high platdiamond competitive game on one of the teams in pc
Overwatch,not_removed,thats so crazy lol one minute she is considered useless in competitive the next she is in ever game just because of an update to her ult
Overwatch,not_removed,yeah i think the same and shes sooooo frustrating to play against
Overwatch,not_removed,someones triggered there bullocks off
Overwatch,not_removed,he was on your team and played bad
Overwatch,not_removed,so because heshe wasnt always in the top he doesnt deserve to be in there sounds like youve got a large load of salt after losing a few matches though im guessing genjihanzo main
Overwatch,not_removed,you dont have to aim to be top
Overwatch,not_removed,apparently you never been to grand master so this doesnt affect you to others who are up here it affects us
Overwatch,not_removed,alright then your post affects people of which at least half wouldnt have reddit nor give a shit thats about people that would care andor be able to see this if it hit front page but considering youve been without many upvotes youve got for this post at the moment of me erm posting this comment itll be very unlikely anyone who falls into said categories has seen this i think youre more bitching to the community to attract attention to you being better then the rest of them of which is debatable and poor sportsmanship not to mention you say in the same sentence that both sr is broken and you want someone else to fix it but giving any ideas on how must be too hard for someone as valuable as you gotta get dat time on genji eh tldr stop bitching on reddit to people who dont care edit although im not a grandmaster so what do you care
Overwatch,not_removed,people clearly your peanut size brain didnt read the part where i said masters grand masters and top smh didnt read your whole post seems like youre the salty one who cant make it out of gold
Overwatch,not_removed,sorry i didnt read your whole original post only got up to the parts of im tired of getting match with so shitty top lets talk about these top there are multiple people like this that do not belong in the top how in the world do these people get up here but yes the last line of of your post was including grandmasters but not masters your entire post is centered around bad top players as such i centered my post around it tldr you didnt even read your own post genjisbackk
Overwatch,not_removed,always be willing to switch heroes the core of overwatch strategy is altering your lineup to counter your opponents if you play only and always a single character youll lack the versatility necessary to contribute to your team its fine to have a favorite even to specialize but refusing to switch when your team needs it makes you that guy dont be that guy related to the above have at least one hero in each role that youre competent with and know when and where theyre put to best use my recommendations for the easiest heroes to learn are soldier bastion reinhardt and lucio avoid genji hanzo tracer and widowmaker for now theyre all very difficult to use well use custom games to explore maps learn their layouts learn their flanking routes learn where health packs are knowing how to find the nearest health pack without looking at it will keep you alive knowing where youre most likely to find a lurking genji how to flank a torb turret where the enemy teleporter most likely is will win you games use a good headset turn off itunes overwatchs sound design is excellent and communicates a huge amount of information to you every character has unique footsteps every gun has a unique report every ability has a unique callout and heroes are quite chatty theres a lot going on but learning how to listen to the game will make you a better player i switched from a crappy logitech to a kingston hyperx cloud revolver and my play immediately improved simply because i could hear more of what was going on around me coordination is key teamwork is op by design if you have a mic use it if you dont well get one but until then join team voice chat anyway and listen call out flanks and targets make your intentions and situation known encourage your team to do the same a lessskilled team that communicates well will beat a more skillful opponent who doesnt likewise dont clutter up the voice channel with useless blather either thats a good way to get yourself muted by your team which means they wont hear you when to do have something important to say play the objective this isnt tdm kills dont matter on their own it doesnt matter if youre the best shot in the world if youre off derping around the edges of the map the entire match youre not helping your team win theres a time and place for big flanks but that time and place is not constantly
Overwatch,not_removed,also use headphones and turn on atmos
Overwatch,not_removed,git gud
Overwatch,not_removed,kalranya covered the important stuff but i would add things go to an overwatch wiki and read up on the heroes abilities the in game info is sorely lacking the wikis will give you the hard numbers and some details that the game doesnt give you play the mystery heroes mode in the arcade ive found it useful for learning how to play heroes i normally wouldnt play
Overwatch,not_removed,the most common mistake i see newcomers make is trying to make big plays all alone enable your team to fulfil their role and they will enable you to make plays for example if youre roadhog instead of going on a flank alone and trying to get solo hooks on squishies stay near your healer and behind your tank so you can save the healer from the flanking genjitracer and they can in turn keep the tank and you alive save the tank getting pinned by the enemy rein by hooking him instantly turning a losing team fight in your favour if your tankhealer lives long enough they will eventually get an ultimate that enables you to make a play dva can send selfdestruct behind the enemy rein forcing him to turn his back on you and you can hook him to win that fight or zarya can graviton for you to combo with whole hog or rein can hammer down for you to perform easy oneshots and ana can just nanoboost you to make your whole hog that much deadlier enabling each other with synergistic picksplays is the key to consistent results
Overwatch,not_removed,find a character that you like it will take a few games to figure out what kinda play style suits you in this game and just enjoy it theres no cod induced rage in this game
Overwatch,not_removed,then again constantly going in solo in an attempt capture the objective isnt helpful since your forcing your team into a additionally you should not switch onto characters that your bad with even if you team needs it as it isnt helpful not having a reinhardt is far better then having a bad one if you want to play flankers such as genji and tracer then go for it the ranked system will place you at the appropriate level headsets are good to have but for the vast majority of players i would not call them necessary
Overwatch,not_removed,thanks for the really indepth guide much appreciated for your first point i understand what you are saying but i am horrific with tanks to the point where it becomes detrimental to my team should i put in the man hours to become a decent tank or just stay away from it another thing is ive become quite fond of lucio and have no problem playing a supporthealer style but what should i do when my team isnt doing enough damage despite having dps but my healing is averaging i like tracer and her play style but aim wise i suck i find myself being put into unfavorable positions hence me dying a lot pharah junk rat and lucio have to be my three favorite heroes as of right now i guess with practice and time ill get better ive been playing with a few friends since i got the game the other night weve just been playing quick game and running through whatever maps and game modes are there the one dumb thing is weve been paired with level and the entire enemy team is level and just thrash us we stand no chance map knowledge is weak but i guess thatll just come with time as well im not a complete dunce but am not tactically sound if that makes any sense voice comms are completely dead in quick play there are a few people who use the standard ingame commands like hello or my ult is almost ready but not much after that i use discord with friends and we usually three queue so we just call out in that i find the same problem in going for the objective as i do in voice comms people will somewhat go for it but they seemingly lack the understanding of having to break the defense prior to capturing it i have something ridiculous like a minute and a half average for obj
Overwatch,not_removed,will check out the wiki thanks ive been playing the myster heroes mode with some friends and im quite fond of it the only problem is that sometimes it gets unmatched like running two lucios or three dvas
Overwatch,not_removed,i played sixty hours of paladins poor mans overwatch and really liked skye similar to tracer my aim with tracer is complete shit though
Overwatch,not_removed,then again constantly going in solo in an attempt capture the objective isnt helpful since your forcing your team into a play the objective means to keep the goal of the map in mind and work toward achieving it rather than just mindlessly chasing kills additionally you should not switch onto characters that your bad with even if you team needs it as it isnt helpful not having a reinhardt is far better then having a bad one hes new hes going to be bad with everyone for a while my four recommendations are the easiest in each category to learn the basics of so he can begin meaningfully contributing to his team while hes still learning the games nuances if you want to play flankers such as genji and tracer then go for it the ranked system will place you at the appropriate level and hell be bad at it or so distracted by trying to be good at it that he wont learn anything else useful and get nothing but hate from his team for it thats not a good way to retain new players note i didnt say dont ever play foo bar baz and quux i said avoid them for now ie while hes still learning the basics headsets are good to have but for the vast majority of players i would not call them necessary necessary no but having a good set of cans versus you monitors crappy speaker is the difference between getting death blossomd out of nowhere and being waiting for reaper the moment he pokes the corner
Overwatch,not_removed,i like to fuck my cat
Overwatch,not_removed,who can spook the spooker
Overwatch,not_removed,be the reaper running routine ops for talon hear gunshots outside wtfjpg see that fucking chad jack morrison killing my soldiers start reciting my epic preconcived banter in case this ever happened morrison laughs and asks if i went to hottopic for my clothes gun falls out of my pocket i try to shoot morrison while he isnt looking get sniped look up and see this girl i had a crush on back in the day more guns fall out she and morrison laugh at me i try to stammer out more badass catchphrases as my guns now pour out of my coat they keep laughing and tell me that fareeha isnt my daughter cry and teleport away tfw
Overwatch,not_removed,and then he kneels down to quickly scuffle em all back in the coat
Overwatch,not_removed,i always thought he should open his coat like a shady watch salesman buy buy buy
Overwatch,not_removed,all i can picture is him flying backwards a few feet as guns explode from him in every direction a la sonic
Overwatch,not_removed,im thinking of the blackwatch reyes skin and how messed up this emote would be like i imagine him clutching going into a tmodel pose and they just start flying out of him in random directions
Overwatch,not_removed,i can imagine that having issues with some of his skins but in some way having guns fall sounds good maybe sleeves would be a bit more universal and consistent ace up his sleeve
Overwatch,not_removed,knees weak arms are heavy
Overwatch,not_removed,or one where he throws his guns on the floor like he usually does but awkwardly picks them back up
Overwatch,not_removed,or one where he gets angry and throws a gun could be a damaging item for like damage too not enough to make any difference but funny nonetheless
Overwatch,not_removed,another idea thats similar reaper opens one half of his jacket and goes whaddya buyin
Overwatch,not_removed,you saw nothing
Overwatch,not_removed,bbaka its not like these guns are ffor you or anything
Overwatch,not_removed,he also needs a greeting where he says hi hi hiiiiiiiiiiii
Overwatch,not_removed,
Overwatch,not_removed,cant wait for the april fools loot crates with this in them d
Overwatch,not_removed,i want a in hidden secret taunt where he fires off a party popper shotgun shell
Overwatch,not_removed,i always envisioned reaper pulling his guns out of some portalesque space under his jacket on the opposite side is a gun rack that he reaches his arms through and grabs his new gats
Overwatch,not_removed,dont make a euphemism out of it you literally want him to shit guns like
Overwatch,not_removed,gotta spam this to lag out enemy computers
Overwatch,not_removed,i always kinda assumed that the reason reaper uses a new pair of shotguns every time is because he makes them with his wraith powers not actually had a bunch of those hidden around his coat
Overwatch,not_removed,its not what it looks like
Overwatch,not_removed,thanksgiving emote reaper throws pies around saying pie pie pie
Overwatch,not_removed,yeah just like a chance for one of the guns to be replaced with a pachimari p
Overwatch,not_removed,i think this would be great but as an easter egg for an emote rather than the emote itself ie every time you emote there is a chance you trigger this hidden emote instead
Overwatch,not_removed,my spaghetti
Overwatch,not_removed,you mean a cute squid onion
Overwatch,not_removed,this thread has me i tears 😂 yes this would be a hilarious emote
Overwatch,not_removed,neat idea but pachimari is roadhogs thing no
Overwatch,not_removed,dammit jack you made me drop my load
Overwatch,not_removed,hey kid you wanna buy a sundial
Overwatch,not_removed,why arent we funding this
Overwatch,not_removed,reaper should get a win pose but with his coat and shotguns
Overwatch,not_removed,id love it if they could actually get away with him opening the side of his coat and having him say what are ya buyin lol
Overwatch,not_removed,falls out of his dimensional portals
Overwatch,not_removed,pleas bliz
Overwatch,not_removed,i could not imagine reaper looking surprised xd
Overwatch,not_removed,or a traveling gun salesman where he opens his coat and says like what you see
Overwatch,not_removed,like a clown car just for guns
Overwatch,not_removed,ahhh out of guns
Overwatch,not_removed,highlight intro
Overwatch,not_removed,does the lady behind the counter at gamestop open her purse to show him how secure her guns are
Overwatch,not_removed,he could juggle his guns
Overwatch,not_removed,he also needs an emote where he opens his coat and you can see a bunch of guns in there and then he says can i offer you something
Overwatch,not_removed,brb gonna try and animate that in sfm
Overwatch,not_removed,this also made me think of the oppositea matrix style scene where the gun racks come zipping in and he just starts stuffing his pockets with guns
Overwatch,not_removed,what about a christmas emote where he opens a present and its some shiny new guns
Overwatch,not_removed,of the things i thought i never needed this is now on the top of my list plz blizz
Overwatch,not_removed,im thinking they should just keep falling and falling into a heap about his feet until the emote ends
Overwatch,not_removed,question is how many would fall out
Overwatch,not_removed,or someone scares the wraith out of him
Overwatch,not_removed,soldier needs a dancing emote to go along with his thriller jacket
Overwatch,not_removed,how about for next halloween they add in an emote of him getting scared of himself and shits out his arsenal
Overwatch,not_removed,videos in this thread videocomment like kevin and his chili just a complete fumblefuck with shotguns aww you guys made me reload allow me to enlighten you as to the reference stan ok alright stan ok relevant im a bot working hard to help redditors find related videos to watch httpsnpredditcomrsubtletvwikimentionedvideos get it on httpschromegooglecomwebstoredetailmentionedvideosforreddfiimkmdalmgffhibfdjnhljpnigcmohf httpsaddonsmozillaorgenusfirefoxaddonmentionedvideosforreddit
Overwatch,not_removed,lol that would be awesome
Overwatch,not_removed,i never knew i needed this so much until you said it
Overwatch,not_removed,instead of being surprised he could just drop his current shotguns and they all fall out when he reaches in to grab another two
Overwatch,not_removed,this has to be a thing
Overwatch,not_removed,that would be amazing im pretty sure im not the only one that wonders where all of his guns come from
Overwatch,not_removed,this would actually be pretty funny
Overwatch,not_removed,alternatively a reaper emote where he hands out shotguns like ana hands out candy
Overwatch,not_removed,moms shotgungetti
Overwatch,not_removed,that would be funny
Overwatch,not_removed,surprised by what
Overwatch,not_removed,i always thought he pulled his guns from the same nether world he goes into when he shadow steps not cannon though i dont think
Overwatch,not_removed,but they patched it and reaper can no longer drop multiple guns ingame d they disappear right away dont they
Overwatch,not_removed,and bastion needs a surprised emote where a brick falls out between his legs
Overwatch,not_removed,does he need it though
Overwatch,not_removed,i need this in my life
Overwatch,not_removed,for aprils fools day
Overwatch,not_removed,blizzard needs to hire you
Overwatch,not_removed,like this
Overwatch,not_removed,please do this yes just yes httpiimgurcomrvyezjlgif how about one where hes attempting to reload a gun but fails
Overwatch,not_removed,if we got that as an emote golden guns for reaper would be even more op d
Overwatch,not_removed,yes please
Overwatch,not_removed,yes please
Overwatch,not_removed,edgelord doesnt get surprised surprised gets edgelordd
Overwatch,not_removed,naah that would require him to show any signs of feelings or personality and we all know that blizzard wouldnt want that
Overwatch,not_removed,i dont like this idea i dont like most of the ideas this subreddit has for the game either
Overwatch,not_removed,
Overwatch,not_removed,we all know he wouldnt pick them up
Overwatch,not_removed,just a complete fumblefuck with shotguns
Overwatch,not_removed,i like this guy guy guy
Overwatch,not_removed,
Overwatch,not_removed,that would be awesome xdd
Overwatch,not_removed,nano boosted bastion tank oo
Overwatch,not_removed,who spooks the spookers this is a question spookical philosophers have asked since the dawn of being spooked plato in his dialogue skeletonias concluded that a skeleton is an entity with the knowledge of spooking which gives it the ability to put someone else into a state of being spooked just like a doctor is someone with the knowledge of healing which allows him to put someone else into a state of being healed this was adopted as the orthodox view of spookers until the age of enlightenment when philosophers used rational thougrt to investigate why skellingtons are so spooky rene descartes meditations on first spookening introduced the idea of i see a skeleton therefore i am spooked which turned spooking into an internal mental phenomenon rather than platos external idea of a spooker the real breakthrough came with max stimer who identiﬁed that most cultural ideas are spooks ie skeletons of the mind scary and incomprehensible but ultimately an illusion summed up in the famous phrase skeletons dont real do they modern philosophers use the terms or spoopy to distinguish the original idea of total spookifying terror from striners more general spookiness
Overwatch,not_removed,figured it would be the ingrate who can spook him
Overwatch,not_removed,
Overwatch,not_removed,it makes a lot of sense to me that reaper would be a regular poster on it just feels right
Overwatch,not_removed,is leaking
Overwatch,not_removed,wouldnt it be more in line with his character to just ditch them there
Overwatch,not_removed,i want to see him squat down and suck them up under his coat like reapfield would
Overwatch,not_removed,what are ya buying
Overwatch,not_removed,
Overwatch,not_removed,
Overwatch,not_removed,sonic reaper skin make it happen blizzard
Overwatch,not_removed,this is what i want when he dies he drops guns
Overwatch,not_removed,reminds me of this scene from im gonna git ya sucka
Overwatch,not_removed,cant see on the work connection is this that gif that someone made of reaper just lying on a massive pile of guns
Overwatch,not_removed,this isbeautiful
Overwatch,not_removed,dude please
Overwatch,not_removed,blackwatch reyes makes it even funnier i think
Overwatch,not_removed,roadhogs little piggy intro only truly works for the skins where he has the pig tattoo on his stomach but its available for all of them
Overwatch,not_removed,also it could just not be available with some skins i see nothing wrong with that
Overwatch,not_removed,vomit on his sweater already anas spaghetti
Overwatch,not_removed,theres vomit on his sweater already his moms a yeti
Overwatch,not_removed,hands are sweaty moms spaghetti
Overwatch,not_removed,theres guns falling out of his sweater already
Overwatch,not_removed,junkrat primed and ready
Overwatch,not_removed,aw shit slowly kneels down
Overwatch,not_removed,throwing the gun doesnt sound too bad but the damage is a horrible idea
Overwatch,not_removed,he should shoot himself in the foot ten damage cries like a baby
Overwatch,not_removed,i wish his melee was also just throwing out a gun
Overwatch,not_removed,httpimgurcomaakezt
Overwatch,not_removed,aah i buy it at a high price
Overwatch,not_removed,lamp oil rope bombs you want it its yours my friend as long as you have enough rubies morshu zelda cdi
Overwatch,not_removed,i have a friend who operates reapers cafe on skirmishes or in eichenvalde before we start on attack and as soon as someone bites and asks for coffee he just goes we dont have coffee we got uh guns yeah all we got is guns and then repeatedly reloads so theres guns all over
Overwatch,not_removed,tsundere reaper is best reaper i think
Overwatch,not_removed,followed by the no one will believe you voice line
Overwatch,not_removed,reaper is gilgamesh king of kings and you mongrels will bow to his noble fantasm
Overwatch,not_removed,reaper was actually a glados test subject who escaped with the portal gun technology
Overwatch,not_removed,like with anderson and his bayonets aka a hammerspace
Overwatch,not_removed,risky click of the day
Overwatch,not_removed,yes that scene was my inspiration for this
Overwatch,not_removed,quick someone post the psst spray again
Overwatch,not_removed,
Overwatch,not_removed,im still waiting for his mariachi skins to play mariachi music when he ults it would be hilarious
Overwatch,not_removed,you know they gotta charge us fight monies for all the emotes tho no way we get anything for free
Overwatch,not_removed,moms spaghetti
Overwatch,not_removed,i believe the term youre looking for is squonion
Overwatch,not_removed,pretty sure its that plushie inside the dropship on koth maps
Overwatch,not_removed,its an overwatch thing its like the mascot of the series
Overwatch,not_removed,wot ya buyinnn
Overwatch,not_removed,whaddaya buyin
Overwatch,not_removed,all of them
Overwatch,not_removed,surprised when sombra actually shows up
Overwatch,not_removed,i think you can get up to or if you fire once then reload but they do disappear quickly
Overwatch,not_removed,gold bricks if you have his golden weapon
Overwatch,not_removed,whats up with the downvotes oo
Overwatch,not_removed,oh please even in universe everyone calls him a fucking dork for being so edgy i think blizzard gave up on trying to make him legitimately cool a long time ago
Overwatch,not_removed,downvoting for the lowkey self promotion also holy shit the colors are too fuckin bright
Overwatch,not_removed,you sound like a fun person
Overwatch,not_removed,you could just ignore it
Overwatch,not_removed,thank you for going out of your way to post a comment on this thread
Overwatch,not_removed,i like this im stealing it
Overwatch,not_removed,he would push them next to the family reapfield and say he did it
Overwatch,not_removed,thank you you just reminded me that i need to do my yearly the office halloween episodes binge
Overwatch,not_removed,yes double thank you god that intro is amazing
Overwatch,not_removed,its probably what i do best
Overwatch,not_removed,reaper could use a new ultimate
Overwatch,not_removed,why rhymes with die though
Overwatch,not_removed,didnt know gabriel reyes reviewed five guys burgers
Overwatch,not_removed,wow people did not find that funny
Overwatch,not_removed,with zarya shield
Overwatch,not_removed,that is pretty spooky but a nano boosted dva outside her mech is spooky af my bastion friend
Overwatch,not_removed,i would shit my pants
Overwatch,not_removed,had a molten core torb get nano boosted last night it was terrifying ripped right through the team firing shotgun blasts and one shotting squishier targets
Overwatch,not_removed,probably browses k to show off his shit load of guns
Overwatch,not_removed,well he is edgy
Overwatch,not_removed,but wheres the people saying that he has autism
Overwatch,not_removed,just brushes them to the side with his feet
Overwatch,not_removed,he wasnt given those guns to toss em around like trash
Overwatch,not_removed,like reapfield would now i want a reaper emote where he pulls out a pasta dish and starts eating souls out of it
Overwatch,not_removed,i want to see him squat down and suck them up surely im not the only one thinking this could have been worded a little better p tobias funke is that you
Overwatch,not_removed,what are you selling
Overwatch,not_removed,eeeeeeeverythings for sale my friend if i had a sister id sell her in a second
Overwatch,not_removed,hey check this out whaddya buyiiiiin heard that in a game once rodin bayonetta
Overwatch,not_removed,reaper wheel reaper deal
Overwatch,not_removed,wanna buy some funnel cakes buy one
Overwatch,not_removed,ya going hunting elephants with that thing
Overwatch,not_removed,nope thats too much
Overwatch,not_removed,you want it baby i got it you need it baby come get it
Overwatch,not_removed,forever gonna be my favorite game i will never not unhear this voice
Overwatch,not_removed,hey hey you want to buy some shotguns on ult buy one
Overwatch,not_removed,ha i forgot about that spray
Overwatch,not_removed,reaper the edgehog reaper the edgelord
Overwatch,not_removed,i feel like shadow would be more fitting for this
Overwatch,not_removed,shadow reaper skin is the only option
Overwatch,not_removed,being able to get death animationsaddon effects would be hilarious reaper spawns guns tracer blips out of existence genjis robo body falls apart a giant portal to hell opens and swallows mei into its fiery depths yanno simple stuff
Overwatch,not_removed,seeing as noone else answered you yes it is and its beautiful
Overwatch,not_removed,
Overwatch,not_removed,i just like making everyone look at roadhogs fat gut and his belly button piercing in the halloween skin of course
Overwatch,not_removed,i mean yes and no the intent of it is lost but there still isnt any reality breaking stuff just a lack of relevancy and were talking about the game where mccrees spit emote specifically spits into his scarf instead of onto the ground on his skins with a scarf blizz seems to be fine with intent being lost but things out of midair or through things though heck that gives me an idea he could have guns falling out of sleeves and bottom of coat and with skins that dont have a long coat they could just hide the coat guns and keep the sleeve ones itd be slightly more upscale but generally the same as mccrees spit method
Overwatch,not_removed,which is why its his worst intro
Overwatch,not_removed,junkrat primed and ready
Overwatch,not_removed,he is meis son
Overwatch,not_removed,hands are sweaty so thats why he always drops his guns
Overwatch,not_removed,but on the surface he looks calm spaghetti
Overwatch,not_removed,the line is theres vomit on his sweater already moms spaghetti if youre going to quote do it right
Overwatch,not_removed,ballistic spaghetti
Overwatch,not_removed,i know its a different game but the handpistol emote on the heavy in also dealt damage it was not useful at all though since it had a very long startup just being in the game and dealing actual damage only up close was pretty funny
Overwatch,not_removed,are you by an chance an unsuspecting sniper main
Overwatch,not_removed,any reason why i see the small amount of damage being a funny thing
Overwatch,not_removed,damage the most that would ever happen are some really funny finishers in casual matches
Overwatch,not_removed,its been about a year since i played through that that lasti need to do it again soon
Overwatch,not_removed,his name is morshu you swine
Overwatch,not_removed,the correct answer was yes sorry jaytalvapes
Overwatch,not_removed,what other dere would you want to see
Overwatch,not_removed,bayonets for days
Overwatch,not_removed,had to google it but yes exactly
Overwatch,not_removed,absolutely beautiful
Overwatch,not_removed,loud mariachi music roses flying out of the smoke and crap just everywhere
Overwatch,not_removed,omfg if that happens i would die of laughter hahaha if they ever actually put that in game they should not give us an updatechange log so people would be so confused when they ult lol
Overwatch,not_removed,i know its just that roadhog is the only character who has his personal emotes featuring them that and theres some with him snagging a whole bunch too
Overwatch,not_removed,thats what i tried a few days back fired once then spammed reloadmeleecancel to make guns appear but it would only show one pair
Overwatch,not_removed,what do you expect its the overwatch sub
Overwatch,not_removed,uh ok
Overwatch,not_removed,sorry i had an opinion that went contrary to the hivemind in this subreddit
Overwatch,not_removed,you made this i made this
Overwatch,not_removed,yep thats how the internet works
Overwatch,not_removed,pie
Overwatch,not_removed,oh my dayum
Overwatch,not_removed,what did he say
Overwatch,not_removed,plus mercy boost
Overwatch,not_removed,her pistol does more than me in turret form it seems sometimes too spooky for me
Overwatch,not_removed,he goes on pol because hes banned from k for being too edgy
Overwatch,not_removed,clearing the area edit holy shit first gold thank you random redditors
Overwatch,not_removed,pulls a rug out of his coat and tosses it on top of them
Overwatch,not_removed,nothin personnel guns
Overwatch,not_removed,til reapfield was a parody of garfield seriously i always thought of seinfield und couldnt figure it out
Overwatch,not_removed,thats why he was so upset when jack was promoted to head of overwatch he could just taste those meaty leading man parts in his mouth
Overwatch,not_removed,ehehehe thank you
Overwatch,not_removed,ill buy itat a high price
Overwatch,not_removed,what can i fix you with
Overwatch,not_removed,hee hee hee thank you
Overwatch,not_removed,im selling these fine leather jackets
Overwatch,not_removed,my friend and i had a theory that at the end of the game you and stupid bitch ashley would be stuck with no exits and a hoard of zombies bearing down on you and steve we named the merchant steve would bust in with his massive arsenal and totally save the day i think our version was better
Overwatch,not_removed,doo come back
Overwatch,not_removed,yoooouu paaaay thiiiis much ok ill sell it to you
Overwatch,not_removed,im pretty sure junkrat is the one with a wheel
Overwatch,not_removed,many deal many thanks
Overwatch,not_removed,maybe some gorillas and pigs and rabbits and a big fuzzy siberian bear
Overwatch,not_removed,buy buy buy and reaper wonders why no one buys his shotguns
Overwatch,not_removed,blessed be this shotgun
Overwatch,not_removed,pssh nothin personnel kid
Overwatch,not_removed,
Overwatch,not_removed,
Overwatch,not_removed,personnel
Overwatch,not_removed,i still want that to be added
Overwatch,not_removed,he looks so frustrated
Overwatch,not_removed,i honestly think itd be hilarious if they just spawned out of nowhere or just the ones in his hands suddenly duplicated and fell everywhere i mean where does he pull new guns from with the skins that dont have a coat anyways i dont play reaper in case thats a dumb question lol
Overwatch,not_removed,catchphrase
Overwatch,not_removed,to drop bombs but he keeps on resetting
Overwatch,not_removed,junkrat prime i cant think of a warframe joke
Overwatch,not_removed,i feel like the recoil from holding two shotguns single handed would definitely make him lose his grip especially if his palms are sweaty
Overwatch,not_removed,to drop bombs but he keeps on spaghetti
Overwatch,not_removed,to drop guns but he keeps on spaghetti
Overwatch,not_removed,allow me to enlighten you as to the reference
Overwatch,not_removed,i didnt plan to quote entirely i just quoted and rhymed into moms spaghetti
Overwatch,not_removed,you must be really fun at parties
Overwatch,not_removed,several taunts in can instakill enemies but only if theyre in front of you after the end of the animation that usually lasts seconds httpswikiteamfortresscomwikitauntsspecialtaunts
Overwatch,not_removed,not just the heavy handpistol a large number of weapons have kill emotes on them to name a few huntsman sandman any secondary save for one as pyro
Overwatch,not_removed,like luigis taunt spiking people hanging on the ledge in smash
Overwatch,not_removed,widowmakins a good job mate
Overwatch,not_removed,in monster hunter doing a shadow boxing emote also does damage
Overwatch,not_removed,not useful until you landed a crit with the mittens
Overwatch,not_removed,yeah like a luigi down taunt
Overwatch,not_removed,yeah i remember that now havent seen a good cdi ytp in years
Overwatch,not_removed,yan wait no that would just be weird nevermind
Overwatch,not_removed,on a slightly different note its interesting how crispin freeman voiced a crazy sadistic vampire in one series and then one of the more gentle and polite characters of overwatch winston
Overwatch,not_removed,too bad i could only find it in potato quality though
Overwatch,not_removed,httpiimgurcomdwqjyiljpg
Overwatch,not_removed,its a stone luigi you didnt make it
Overwatch,not_removed,i maked dis
Overwatch,not_removed,heroes never pie
Overwatch,not_removed,yo reyes what do you want for dinner pie pie pie
Overwatch,not_removed,what is more important about reapers lines the rhyming or the d
Overwatch,not_removed,no that starts with a t
Overwatch,not_removed,were goin ham
Overwatch,not_removed,damn damn damn
Overwatch,not_removed,and a symmetra shield totally useful guys right guys
Overwatch,not_removed,woah there satan calm down
Overwatch,not_removed,you spooked me
Overwatch,not_removed,they dont stack
Overwatch,not_removed,i mainly play reaper yes i am an edge lord and zenyata whenever is see a dva outside her mech when playing reaper i am usually okay but if im playing zenyata i become made of paper and get ripped apart
Overwatch,not_removed,frightful beeping
Overwatch,not_removed,and for insisting that one only needs to reach into their trench coat to withdraw more fully loaded shotguns after dropping the empties
Overwatch,not_removed,implying implications
Overwatch,not_removed,reapers friendly ult line in french can be translated to something like im tidyingcleaning up the area so its almost too perfect je nettoye la zone
Overwatch,not_removed,take your upvote and get out
Overwatch,not_removed,tosses his coat on them only to reveal that he had an identical one beneath it
Overwatch,not_removed,seinfeld
Overwatch,not_removed,i thought it was because hes a field of death rip brain
Overwatch,not_removed,oh wait wtf i just looked it up reapfield is the name of an actual real estate company lol
Overwatch,not_removed,people on this sub dont like offhanded jokes it seems who knew
Overwatch,not_removed,what can i do you for
Overwatch,not_removed,ill give you the best deals or die die die trying
Overwatch,not_removed,buy for special price for you
Overwatch,not_removed,shotguns get your shotguns here throws revolver to both players
Overwatch,not_removed,
Overwatch,not_removed,
Overwatch,not_removed,edit a few words and its pretty much reaper
Overwatch,not_removed,first time ive ever seen it and now i want it in game now too
Overwatch,not_removed,coat or no coat the dude probably pulls all his guns out of a hellmouth
Overwatch,not_removed,children behave
Overwatch,not_removed,you tried
Overwatch,not_removed,be vauban equip tonkor junkrat
Overwatch,not_removed,and hes got those tiny claw hands
Overwatch,not_removed,so youre saying that reaper gotta get a grip
Overwatch,not_removed,what he wrote down the whole crowd goes spaghetti
Overwatch,not_removed,however has significantly less cc i think it might actually be possible to force someone to stay in range for that in overwatch of course then they could probably just kill you instead since the only probable way to do it is a mei wall locking them in with you
Overwatch,not_removed,hadouuuuken
Overwatch,not_removed,also demoknight taunt kills ubersaw spoiknoife
Overwatch,not_removed,good people still exist apparently
Overwatch,not_removed,its such a shame they have been completely unable to recapture what made so good
Overwatch,not_removed,resident evil sonic adventure and banjo tooie are my constantly replay games
Overwatch,not_removed,i never realized he was winston now i want to hear pure character inception winston imitating alucard i need this
Overwatch,not_removed,httpimgurcomrhighqualitygifsxwvyl
Overwatch,not_removed,
Overwatch,not_removed,for a price
Overwatch,not_removed,heroes never cry
Overwatch,not_removed,too bad i really wanted some of that mercy pie
Overwatch,not_removed,reaper needs a chef skin fry fry fry
Overwatch,not_removed,sigh sigh sigh
Overwatch,not_removed,the d hehe yeaaaaaa
Overwatch,not_removed,youre right i will attempt to cleanse my shame
Overwatch,not_removed,lol poor guy
Overwatch,not_removed,the only shield flimsier than symmetras is overconfidence
Overwatch,not_removed,ive actually saved a mercys life with the symmetra shield before she was down to only like health and i threw the shield on her and she lived as she flew away i was so proud
Overwatch,not_removed,and torbjorn armor
Overwatch,not_removed,it is why the sarcasm
Overwatch,not_removed,with lucio breaking it down
Overwatch,not_removed,armor over here
Overwatch,not_removed,dont forget the harmony orb were running a team for this nightmare now
Overwatch,not_removed,we mast go deeper with zarya ult and zen discord on the tanks
Overwatch,not_removed,whenever i play zenyatta wait im dead
Overwatch,not_removed,greentexting on reddit
Overwatch,not_removed,i cant even imagine reaper talking in french
Overwatch,not_removed,
Overwatch,not_removed,brilliant
Overwatch,not_removed,frankensteen
Overwatch,not_removed,i saw jerry seinfeld the other day just passed him in the street in ontario canada it was weird
Overwatch,not_removed,mandela effect in action
Overwatch,not_removed,i get the same deal on my curry
Overwatch,not_removed,mariachi version holy shit
Overwatch,not_removed,thats what they say when were together
Overwatch,not_removed,children behave a slave obeys
Overwatch,not_removed,and succeeded apparently
Overwatch,not_removed,
Overwatch,not_removed,he opens his mouth but spaghetti wont come out
Overwatch,not_removed,yea better to use a taunt to do dmg than to shoot enemy in the face while the enemy is cced
Overwatch,not_removed,or a junkrat trap but they can shoot you down while you rev up the taunt
Overwatch,not_removed,put them to sleep tell your team not to shoot them easy seconds where they cant do a damn thing
Overwatch,not_removed,or anas sleep dart
Overwatch,not_removed,he needs a voice line calling tracer police girl or a double reference how bitches love tesla cannons
Overwatch,not_removed,hey hey wanna buy a funnel cake
Overwatch,not_removed,i actually far prefer pie to cake
Overwatch,not_removed,for a slice
Overwatch,not_removed,hey reaper what are your thoughts on hillary clinton lie lie lie
Overwatch,not_removed,honestly id prefer a zenyatta give me sage advice than a symetra give me a shield
Overwatch,not_removed,overconfidence is a slow and insidious killer
Overwatch,not_removed,its free health off of every trade its usefulness ranges from a reaper down to a torbjörn
Overwatch,not_removed,here take it your filthy filthy upvote dad
Overwatch,not_removed,i cant wait to toss your corpse on a jumppad and watch it take to the air like a childs imagination
Overwatch,not_removed,a better example would be the time we had an attack symmetra he swapped after first point btw who had given all of us shields i stepped out of spawn and the junkrat had trapped it with a mine this combo does dmg and since i had i lived
Overwatch,not_removed,wouldnt it be better if she had the shield to start with besides if she lived with the shield she still mightve lived without it sounds like she didnt take any direct hits
Overwatch,not_removed,now i want to see a comp revolving around boostion
Overwatch,not_removed,the armor is actually pretty good the trick is to just spam it in key areas
Overwatch,not_removed,and reinhardt on top of him with a shield
Overwatch,not_removed,fuck tracer
Overwatch,not_removed,nah zenyatta has got to be a lama of some kind so if you get taken out as zenyatta youll just be reincarnated p
Overwatch,not_removed,ugh thanks
Overwatch,not_removed,omle du fromage
Overwatch,not_removed,mourir mourir mourir
Overwatch,not_removed,httpsgfycatcomilliteratedimpledandeancat
Overwatch,not_removed,i swear that gif will just be dots soon
Overwatch,not_removed,haha exactly
Overwatch,not_removed,mirachi version
Overwatch,not_removed,and watch how you play
Overwatch,not_removed,im sorry what
Overwatch,not_removed,what are you thinking
Overwatch,not_removed,now would you kindly get on the point
Overwatch,not_removed,no he didnt if you look at the lyrics of the song and the rhythm catchphrase doesnt fit in even if reddit disagrees i still thought it was funny because reinhardts catchphrase isnt a good catchphrase and this is a response that doesnt fit either so i think he nailed it he tried like reinhardt tried
Overwatch,not_removed,hes chokin now moms spaghetti
Overwatch,not_removed,well the guy i was responding to mentioned taunts that instakill so i was working in that context you might not be able to kill something like a rein in the duration of a single cc
Overwatch,not_removed,mei freeze or ana sleep would be easy
Overwatch,not_removed,on its own is a fun action game though imo super excited for
Overwatch,not_removed,police girl would be amusing winstons too much of a gentlescientist to make a crack about bitches loving any kind of cannons
Overwatch,not_removed,buy one
Overwatch,not_removed,seeing as we just got the pie card back this is even more relevant
Overwatch,not_removed,guess youre not a hero then
Overwatch,not_removed,oh lets bake it now
Overwatch,not_removed,what is the mental state of snoop dog high high high
Overwatch,not_removed,probably cause it means you have a zen instead of symmetra on your team
Overwatch,not_removed,a devastating strike
Overwatch,not_removed,how quickly the tide turns
Overwatch,not_removed,dazed reeling about to break
Overwatch,not_removed,attack symmetra is specificly for the ridonkulous teleport behind the second point p
Overwatch,not_removed,duuude would you just okay
Overwatch,not_removed,shh let him think he did something
Overwatch,not_removed,get down mr president
Overwatch,not_removed,i dont play tracer enough to call her my main but god damn is she fun to melt squishies like zenyatta with
Overwatch,not_removed,the only thing worse than getting matched up with a tracer as zen is getting matched up with a tracer as symmetra
Overwatch,not_removed,i havent had as many problem tracers since the patch that increases left click damage but needed discord most of them seem to panic recall as soon as discord is on them but to be fair thats in qp
Overwatch,not_removed,behind this mask is another mask pretty cool right
Overwatch,not_removed,what about when brads bastion mask falls off and he has a muselk mask underneath it or the bucketheaded carhopper
Overwatch,not_removed,they dont understand
Overwatch,not_removed,play nice play pharah
Overwatch,not_removed,didnt know rapture had the internet
Overwatch,not_removed,relevant username
Overwatch,not_removed,its a reference to bioshock
Overwatch,not_removed,i got you in my slice
Overwatch,not_removed,build em up bake em down
Overwatch,not_removed,what if it means you have both
Overwatch,not_removed,damn son
Overwatch,not_removed,
Overwatch,not_removed,exposed to a killing blow
Overwatch,not_removed,or making life hell for a bastion behind a rein sheild especially at anubis and the german castle
Overwatch,not_removed,
Overwatch,not_removed,thats the last time im shielding anyone
Overwatch,not_removed,fucking flair checks out bully confirmed
Overwatch,not_removed,lucky discord headshot everytime
Overwatch,not_removed,repeat the process in the gif until the respective personmachinewhatever dies
Overwatch,not_removed,check his username
Overwatch,not_removed,just icing rains from above im bad at puns
Overwatch,not_removed,rip
Overwatch,not_removed,better hope the enemy team are really good at falling for traps and that the zenyatta has perfect aim otherwise youre fucked
Overwatch,not_removed,then gg
Overwatch,not_removed,done with reddit for today
Overwatch,not_removed,yes darkest dungeon fans
Overwatch,not_removed,done with reddit for today
Overwatch,not_removed,rretiredgif
Overwatch,not_removed,how do you not know the name of eichenwalde its totally simple for germans like me that is
Overwatch,not_removed,oh oooooooooooh
Overwatch,not_removed,frost this
Overwatch,not_removed,stay as team
Overwatch,not_removed,personally i dont care about ult charges they dont take much to regen so ill swap to whatever i need to regardless as for team comp id rather change to a genjijunkrat from a support role to deal with a bastion that is mowing down my team because theyre a bunch of window lickers and charge head on into his fire once its been taken care of then swap back ending cards are pretty much meaningless to me and people i play with they do nothing but put people on your preferred list same for rating the game i think its more a sense of personal achievement rather than a team focus a lot of people are so caught up in making sure theyre doing the best on the team rather than whats best for the team i cant even count the times a team has been steamrolled because they chose a hanzo and widow with no healer
Overwatch,not_removed,yes but when your team is getting rekt and youre one of genjis
Overwatch,not_removed,even if you started as tankhero you can switch to a different of the same role ill start as mercy and switch to lucio if our pushes arent working as for ults if you switch to a more viable character tool regain that ult fairly quick and probably a more useful ult at that
Overwatch,not_removed,ending cards are pretty much meaningless to me and people i play with they do nothing but put people on your preferred list same for rating the game did you assume this or did blizzard actually say this i will start upvoting noobs more so i can be the pro guy in the team more often
Overwatch,not_removed,then the rest of the team failed in not picking all genji p
Overwatch,not_removed,its been posted in this sub a few times i knew that voting for individuals cards put that person on your preferred list but i only recently found out that voting the game does the same but for everyone apparently so voting negative puts everyone on avoid vote neutral does nothing and vote positive puts everyone on preferred
Overwatch,not_removed,yasssss but actually this one time it actually worked
Overwatch,not_removed,i always voted for how balanced the teams were put together by the matchmaking not that i wanted to block them
Overwatch,not_removed,well i assume its for more along the lines of this team was competent id like to play with them again or this team is useless and id prefer to not play with them just so youre aware avoid doesnt mean block blocking someone makes it so you never see them again whereas avoiding them will still put you in a game with them if theres no other spots in your skill pool left youll probably only see avoided players past midnight
Overwatch,not_removed,i thought it was going to be impossible for efi to build a machine in a day i thought the same
Overwatch,not_removed,that would be an awful piece of video if you ask me if it montage in the beginning and the rest was new hero vs doomfist itd be already a lot better
Overwatch,not_removed,yeah i agree but it wont be an animated short imo because the playlist for them wasnt updated but the one for origin story videos was so i think shell get that instead
Overwatch,not_removed,airport was attacked guntlet was stolen efi was there and decided to build her bot etc i want that short
Overwatch,not_removed,problem random matchmaker places op with teammates who dont use their voice comms solution op forms their own team where everyone uses voice comms question why is the op not forming their own team full of people using voice comms
Overwatch,not_removed,if you have issues inviting people directly ingame try clicking prefer this player and giving them a compliment about their play theyll be more likely to remember you later on consider posting an ad to roverwatchlft or roverwatchlfg for players at your rank and region too
Overwatch,not_removed,because i have severe clinical depression which prevents me from actually inviting people due to the fact that my mental illness keeps making me think that people dont want to play with me unless they invite me first
Overwatch,not_removed,if youve actually been diagnosed as such shouldnt the medication be helping to alleviate such concerns
Overwatch,not_removed,it only helps so much it wont magically cure me i play overwatch to kind of make me feel better if im playing with my friends or if im playing with randoms on the comms because a lot of times i have some of my best matches with randoms
Overwatch,not_removed,i have deaf friends who play fps like overwatch for obvious reasons it isnt the most practical thing to be using voicecomms as a deaf person whether by choice or otherwise not everyone will be using voicecomms is it that unreasonable for people not to use voicecomms given that everyone has their own circumstances
Overwatch,not_removed,i get that but at the same time overwatch has a massive amount of players i highly doubt that im in a minority and i get some people dont have mics some people are deaf some people are just assholes i just dont get how people can continually play this game in silence if they have the means and im pretty sure that of people have the means hell until i get a new pair of headphones im actually using earbuds to talk to people im on console aswell where voicecomm is the only way to talk to your team and it just upsets me with the constant radio silence it also doesnt help that i need audio to help stimulate my brain if its dead quiet like this game usually is then i can actually get a panic attack
Overwatch,not_removed,you will be surprise by the amount of player who dont use voice in game unless they are playing with friends and it will be the majority of console player since its mostly children or parents let their children play with them
Overwatch,not_removed,i guess i used to barely talk and then i realize how much communication helps and the more i talk usually it helps me feel better about this game because overwatch is really frustrating sometimes and talking to people helps me from getting tilted super easily
Overwatch,not_removed,huh weird maybe you could use it to fake out an enemy
Overwatch,not_removed,so it wasnt lag
Overwatch,not_removed,segregating the player base is what kills games overwatch is already splitting its population over three server clusters and a pile of different game modes and queue times are already unacceptably long for a game thats supposed to be massively popular if you dont want to play with players you cant understand start learning a new language
Overwatch,not_removed,theres no way a language lock would be effective im afraid just like some korean players use a vpn to make american accounts theres nothing stopping anyone who speaks any language to choose english just because they prefer to play on more active servers i would recommend utilizing the comm wheel as much as you can even just having an understood or group up is better than nothing
Overwatch,not_removed,the problem isnt the players without a mic the problem is the players who are unsatisfied with the teammates the matchmaker provides yet refuse to do anything about it such as forming their own team
Overwatch,not_removed,too bad im halfway done with my placement matches and i didnt use a mic just need that spray p you can still win without a mic you know you just need to at least hear your teammates
Overwatch,not_removed,because hearing a genji main scream about no healers makes the team way better
Overwatch,not_removed,no u
Overwatch,not_removed,the fact that i am grand master without ever using a mic makes your post invalid
Overwatch,not_removed,yes everyone should spend an additional amount of money on top of purchasing the game to have fun
Overwatch,not_removed,what spray
Overwatch,not_removed,yes people should spend the additional couple bucks to ensure they have a proper competitive experience if you wanna have fun without a mic just play quick play rather than immediately handicap any team you match with in competitive
Overwatch,not_removed,the season two spray
Overwatch,not_removed,you can still communicate with your team without a mic
Overwatch,not_removed,sorry im pretty bad so i only play quick play what do you have to accomplish to get that spray do you have to reach a certain rank
Overwatch,not_removed,oh there are two kinds of sprays you can only get from competitive play one being the season spray and the top season spray you get the first one from completing the placement matches that determine your rank and the other you can only get if you place top in your region
Overwatch,not_removed,ohhh gotcha i see thanks for your response when does season end should i do my placement matches asap to grab the spray im not actually that bad i was just being selfdeprecating im actually mediocrenormal thanks again
Overwatch,not_removed,it ends nov i think im pretty sure you can do matches in days p also i think you get the spray after the season ends and not right after the placement matches edit i just finished my placement matches by the way and i dont have the spray so im pretty sure thats the case
Overwatch,not_removed,nice i appreciate you sharing this info with me good luck and i hope you get the halloween items you want in the next hours d
Overwatch,not_removed,thank you

Overwatch,not_removed,the cash already flows in steady enough once youre in the multiple duplicate stage dont be greedy
Overwatch,not_removed,or every time you get a duplicate out of a loot box it queues meis sorry voice line
Overwatch,not_removed,they dont want you to be able to buy things fast
Overwatch,not_removed,its a bug that happened or days ago a lot of people have been getting loot boxes blizzard is looking in to this however editblizzard gave people boxes as a apology for the server issues and ddos attacks
Overwatch,not_removed,yeah i just saw the reddit post from the other day apparently it was supposed to be confined to sea due to ddos attacks
Overwatch,not_removed,all of sudden death is a hodge podge of dumbass ideas made by your favorite resident blizzard oh yes lets make a competitive system have rng base time limits and other bullshit that shafts your playerbase with a fuck you
Overwatch,not_removed,i just dont like the people that say fuck the team im playing what i want when i want and i expect you to work around me i only play competitive because i enjoy working with a team and people who are quite happy to throw team comp out the window because theyd rather play dps really frustrate me if youre good with that hero sure thats great but im sure as hell not going to have fun healing dps with hardly a team to hide behind teamwork involves considering your teamates i play whatever hero is wanted or needed by the team because generally its more fun if everyone just cooperates with each other
Overwatch,not_removed,your teammates do not owe you anything yes its a team game yes you should work with your team to win and you should do what you can to support team cohesion but your teammates do not care about you getting the win they might not even care if they get the win sometimes in the case of trolls which i have encountered in comp the only person who cares about getting the win for you is you alone and whoever you premade with that is it you are the only constant across all of your games not one tricks not leavers not anything else all of that is a statical anomaly and will not prevent your climb if you the individual constant have the skill to climb you can ask your team mates to switch but they dont have to you can beg your team to make a meta team comp but they dont have to you can beg your team members to group up and communicate but they dont have to why because they are fully autonomous random people who owe you nothing and couldnt care less about you getting the w they only care about themselves getting the w and helping you is only a means to get what they want and they will go for the win in whatever way they deem most effective and there is absolutely nothing you can do to change this behavior except one thing get over it and focus on the only variable that matters yourself
Overwatch,not_removed,no youre upset because theyre a one trick torb not because theyre a one trick you wont see anyone bitching about someone being a one trick rein or a one trick ana because theyre useful in almost every comp
Overwatch,not_removed,im happy to changed if asked you are not allowed to bitch though if you ask me to move to a character i cant play cant have it both ways i got put with a team of a few days ago they asked me to swap dps to tank and bothered to see what i had played and offered me the rein but was happy to take hog great bunch of guys to comp with was annoyed i couldnt press the stay as group button these people i like however my next match i got bitched at because i was and wasnt focusing the pharah pro tip guys the pharah knows im a threat and will avoid me i only saw the pharah once the entire round rather than argue and bring the team down i swapped to what they wanted zen i have almost experience as zen and tried my best but the same person was being bitchy about me not pocketing them another pro tip i need los to help you i cannot keep up with a pharah and it made me feel like shit and ive not gone back to comp since note i am yet to complete my placements this season so the mm was possibly more wonky than normal i just wish i could join some friendly people for comp but no of my normal crew want to comp
Overwatch,not_removed,the most fun i have in overwatch is when me and my team work together i definitely have a main but filling roles so the team succeeds is much more rewarding and fun i leave playing my mains for quick play i wish people would have this view more commonly
Overwatch,not_removed,the problem isnt the hero selection the problem is the expectation that people the matchmaker randomly assigns to your team should care about you in any way shape or form would you still be here ranting if your team won thats all it boils down to
Overwatch,not_removed,whenever somebody instalocks some of the niche heroes i cringe not because they picked a niche hero but because i know the rest of the team will go apeshit i feel that is worse for your chance of winning than actually having the niche hero people should calm down a bit some recent stories which got me thinking about this a few days ago i played with a bastion main his name had bastion in it and he had played only bastion i just accepted it some of the people on the team obviously started yelling and complaining but we went with it it was a close game but we lost at the end the bastion was carrying us quite a bit and a couple of us me as zaryarein and our ana were trying to accommodate the bastion which did wonders a lot of the time the very next game the enemy team has a sombra main we won that match close game again but the sombra was constantly harassing us going behind us annoying and often killing the backline hacking health packs and me as rein casting good ults etc at the end the enemy team went our sombra threw and they were obviously tilted several of us defended the sombra by saying that she was doing her job well of course picking one of these niche heroes in competitive solely for the novelty is dumb but they can be very strong if your team is willing to work around them and the if there is important tldr i wish people were less tilted when a niche main inevitably shows up in the team since tilting only makes things worse wanting to play a niche character is fine although admittedly if your team refuses to go along with it you might want to switch to something else if you want to win
Overwatch,not_removed,as long as hes tossing out armor packs and not being completely stupid with the turrets i love to have a torb rather than the trust me guys im good at headshots widowmaker
Overwatch,not_removed,all the crap going on during hero selection makes me appreciate lols select your role before queuing for ranked games
Overwatch,not_removed,im a bot bleep bloop someone has linked to this thread from another place on reddit footerif you follow any of the above links please respect the rules of reddit and dont vote in the other threads rtotesmessenger messagecomposetortotesmessenger bot
Overwatch,not_removed,stop blaming teammates with what you perceive as bad picks or bad play start looking at games as a whole look at what happens around you and youll find that everyone on your team makes mistakes maybe that reinhardt was too passive maybe that healer didnt prioritize her targets right maybe the other dps wasnt picking off key targets either maybe that zarya wasnt using her barriers well theres so much shit that can and will go wrong if you think about all that maybe youll realize that the torb might notve been that bad after all the only time a single person is at fault is when theyre actively trolling and working against you when you blame others you stop being critical of yourself you stop improving your own play start blaming yourself instead of others when i lose i blame myself for fucking up individual plays because if i didnt we mightve won that push or ultimately even the game overwatch competitive is more about who makes less mistakes the team that makes less mistakes generally wins
Overwatch,not_removed,torb is not the reason you lost just know that
Overwatch,not_removed,would you rather have a decently good torb on attack or a poorly played meta hero otp tend to be just that they get good results on their main and suck as everyone else do you honestly think that if they just select ana or rein they will suddenly contribute more to the team another thing too there is nothing wrong with being a competitive otp hell it can even get you all the way to the professional level if youre that good at it the issue arises when your hero isnt the best for a certain situation and thus that pick is suboptimal otps get around this by being much better than most players on that hero to make up for the drawbacks an otp winston doesnt switch off when the enemy has reaper and hog they just shield dance and use other tricks to even up their odds sure they are playing at a lower effectiveness due to their counters but playing their main at lowered effectiveness is almost always better than playing a good pick at a worse effectiveness in a sr game i would rather have an sr torb on attack than have a sr rein now the real issue is when the otps play their mains at the same level that flex players play their entire pool this set up only works when the otp is legitimately good at their main and specifically good enough to make up for any weaknesses and counters youre not much of a one trick pony if you dont have any tricks tldr theres nothing wrong with focusing on being only good with one hero the problem is when you are just average at them and suck with everyone else
Overwatch,not_removed,im willing to counter pick im not willing to be told what to play by some insta locking douchenozzle especially if they want a specific hero to carry their ass while they pick whatever if you pick something that requires a specific team comp and then whine that everyone should pick around you because you loaded seconds faster i may want you to lose more than i want myself to win
Overwatch,not_removed,im sorry but i dont agree with this i dont give a fuk if someone mains torbsymsombraetc as long as they are good with them and are actually trying to win the game the people i have a problem with is people who decide to throw the game because they end up having a torbsymsombraetc straight out of spawn theyll pick hazno when they have played that season and then have the gall to bitch at the one trick pony idiotic logic
Overwatch,not_removed,im honestly not flexible at all but i never get flak for playing my favorite hero i wonder why
Overwatch,not_removed,but i really support best as lucio
Overwatch,not_removed,i really dont understand what these sorts of threads are meant to do i symapthize for sure but i mean if youre the kind of player that is doing these sorts of things are you really gonna be browsing reddit and go huh i guess im the asshole should take a good hard look at my life choices and make some changes most of these people wont even care enough about the game to be on this forum and if they are its probably just to meme andor troll if they cared about discussing the state of competitive and bettering themselves they certainly wouldnt be acting like that in the first place
Overwatch,not_removed,reverse rant i hate the people who get instantly triggered when i pick my character then go into verbal abuse and whine that they couldnt get me to budge im trying to win too now you go focus on your game im a tracer genji main and i play at the diamond level you wont find me switching to tanks or healers but will i demote to silver because of it nah will i stay high diamond yeah could i gain more rating if i was more flexible probably am i upset at the matchmaking rating im at not really
Overwatch,not_removed,meh the game is pairing them with you for a reason they have been able to hold their own with the chosen hero well enough to stay at a certain rank as long as they are putting in effort into winning then i dont see the issue often i find people are far more successful that way than if i tried to force them to play something they dont enjoy
Overwatch,not_removed,its just comp bro
Overwatch,not_removed,lol i posted this and the hive mind told me git gud ive realized while your post is true most people see the poster and the bad playerreason for a loss
Overwatch,not_removed,sounds like you need to focus more on your own faults and improve on that just let those games be a part of your winloss statistics and focus on improving yourself just because you lost a game doesnt mean you cant improve as a player and be better off for it
Overwatch,not_removed,that torb guy is a legend i aspire to be like him
Overwatch,not_removed,is this still a problem if i main lucio and only play him in comp 🤔
Overwatch,not_removed,i bet this doesnt apply to support mains does it ¬¬
Overwatch,not_removed,you lost once you pinned the blame on one player if all he does is play torb then him switching wont help maybe you or others on the team could switch to something that complements torb blindly following the meta also isnt flexible
Overwatch,not_removed,as a torb main i get that a lot i get blamed for defeat i get blamed for draw i get blamed even for victory im serious i can carry the whole team and i still get blamed screw you torb people refuse to team up after match i played torb people refuse to team up with me even when im ready to play other heroes high number of hours on torb is like a stigma for me nobody ever looks at the win rate which is like torb is a viable pick if played correctly this isnt a team fortress engie your turret is completely disposable place it somewhere close to the enemy dont try to control area too big if it gets destroyed spam another one — you can make a new one after mere seconds you placed the previous one if it survives upgrade it eventually by trial and error you will learn that you need to place your turret a bit away from the rest of your team where it provides some pain for the enemy team but not enough to launch offense against your baby just place it somewhere where its not the top priority for wasting dvas ult for example the rest of the time you have to jump around like an idiot and shoot people from a big distance by pressing if someone with huge hitbox is close keep jumping and pressing drop armor for yourself first others second in case there are some issues and you have someone chasing you drop turrets never think twice before placing them just spam them jump like an idiot and press in the event of something huge incoming you can ult just keep doing that jumping like an idiot and shooting routine dont stare at mercys ass if the round already started keep jumping instead if your spacebar breaks buy a new keyboard and keep jumping like an idiot god i love jumping in this game on attack torb can take care of flankers he is less viable as someone who breaks enemys defense on choke points ulting torb is a quite scary looking midget though but you dont normally expect dps to get past choke points on their own anyway after loud german idiot launches himself forward you can always settle down the area your team controls from now on by placing a turret torb is great for providing some stability to area your team controls you still need that on attack im not a so called one trick pony i can play tanks healers well pretty much every hero in the game doesnt require that much skill to play decently playing torb is fun but sometimes i even get ragequitters who ruin my games his turret has perfect aim from huge distance — not even soldier has that — his gun has like reapers shotgun damage so i play torb only to climb since most of the time a turret and sexually aggressive assogling ikea gnome is better than even a reaper on offense at least in the skill bracket im at but still playing this game made me realize a serious thing in life everyone always thinks its not their fault everyone always blames others just to feel better ive never heard im sorry that was my fault maybe i did but i dont recall that ever happening if someone refuses to switch deal with it and try to work around with stubborn people pick a hero that compliments them ask them to group up no amount of angry reddit posts is going to change the fact people do what they want online also your teammate who picks a hero you dont personally approve is not trolling or griefing reporting that is completely pointless — blizzard does not take any action against that so yeah if you want a victory soloqueueing — earn it you can hate the fact you have to adjust to random people you dont know but you cant change it
Overwatch,not_removed,rant if you want a decent and semi intelligent discussion about overwatch dont visit this sub ever even roverwatchcirclejerk has more rational discussions about this game its fucking sad
Overwatch,not_removed,if you get an otp build around him
Overwatch,not_removed,how about this try to cooperate with people like this and accept his hero choice torb on attack isnt that bad its not all about his turret his gun is very powerful with damage for primary fire and a secondary fire which can two shot a reinhard as a bonus he gives out armour packs generally the team that cooperates and comunicates more will win its a team based game not a meta heroes based game
Overwatch,not_removed,protip zenyatta and torb are complementary you dont even need to be that good at zenyatta stay behind the turret and launch discord orbs at whoever the turret is targeting
Overwatch,not_removed,this happens to me so much i have stopped playing comp i like playing zen mercy junkrat and reaper what i hate is before the match has even started umm could not be zen ana is a better choice could you be lucio instead and not zenyatta im not a very good analucio i can mercy very well would someone else like to switch silence one min into the map when im playing zenyatta who im really great with and my team cant kill anyone or break a defense we need an ana zenyatta isnt very good switch i have silver elims and healing yall arent killing anyone i know because im not getting any offensive or defensive assits no healer can heal you through fuck tons of burst damage your taking
Overwatch,not_removed,queued with a guy on console whos name was imnotawidowmain and guess what only played widow in any game mode on that account then thought we were rude when we got angry he wouldnt switch to anything more useful so infuriating
Overwatch,not_removed,too many carebears in this thread kill me
Overwatch,not_removed,ok loweffort shitposting guidelines rant based posts which wont provide room for noninflammatory discussion examples include the commonorgarden salthype posts i mean this is nothing more than some random personal rant i dont understand why this has so many upvotes its not a discussion at all theres no room for discourse whatsoever what is the point of a post like this other than to blow off steam
Overwatch,not_removed,when will some of these solohero players understand that overwatch isnt the game where you can just carry you can get kills in a match and still lose its happened to me its heavily teambased
Overwatch,not_removed,that isnt about not being flexible that is about not being an asshole like him
Overwatch,not_removed,i cant tell whats worse either those who reply back still adamant on sticking to their pick or those who dont respond at all and stick to their pick even after we lose due to them being stubborn so sick of it
Overwatch,not_removed,i got you changes from hanzo to widow
Overwatch,not_removed,had a guy insta lock bastion yesterday and say can we get a reinhardt to shield me after someone picked rein the next pick was junkrat and he says i dont think we need a junkrat can you play something else yes everyone should play around you and no one else gets to play what they want not surprising his profile indicated he only played bastion and was not very good
Overwatch,not_removed,this is why i stay out of competitive when im in the mood to play a certain hero ill play them and just stick to arcade httpimgurcomgallerycmfkfgp
Overwatch,not_removed,ive had more people throw because there was a torb on the team than teams losing because of a torb pick
Overwatch,not_removed,also if you dont play with a mic you can die
Overwatch,not_removed,i very adamantly only paly roadhog if at all possible i ask to play roadhog hes my comfort hero and my best on the other hand im also a good pharah and zarya if needed im also learning to be a better soldier in qp
Overwatch,not_removed,this is an unfortunate aspect of the game ow was designed with teamwork as the focal point of the game its really hard to get things done without a team who is willing to work together i actually havent even played ow in the past two weeks because its become so frustrating to get people like this
Overwatch,not_removed,lmao i have a symmetra only copypasta that i use when i get assholes like that a guy that came into my game once literally just posted a rant on why he wouldnt switch and that hed block anyone that asked him to so i copied it and made a bind
Overwatch,not_removed,when i play hanzo in competitive people look at my small amount of hanzo playtime in competitive and say dude youre really going to practice in competitive nbsp and im like everyone had zero hours of hanzo playtime at some point the only way to get playtime is to surprise play
Overwatch,not_removed,i have about hours into overwatch and i have been playing since beta i am not a great player mainly due to not being able to aim well over those hours however i have figured out what works for me to raise my competitive rank playing symmetra i have tried flexfilling for weeks at a time and every time i start trying to fill what is needed my rank starts plummeting last time i did it was at the beginning of this season i started waiting until the last pick to see what would be the most useful pick possible i did this for about weeks of playing matches per day my rank went from to during that time i got tired of losing so i decided to start maining symmetra again since then i have done nothing but rise in rankings now sitting near my all time high of because of my experiences i will continue to play only symmetra in every game sure it may not work with some teams especially when everyone gets salty right off the bat and starts yelling at me to switch the fact of the matter is though that i will win more than i will lose over a large sample set which will allow me to go up in rank quite frankly i dont give a damn if it pisses you off it helps me and thats what matters source winrate as symmetra over hours this season
Overwatch,not_removed,im all for people playing characters they are good at but the problem comes when they dont try to learn more than a couple characters sometimes you have to adapt and counter them ive seen countless matches have comebacks from being down to win just because we switched it up and countered their characters and they didnt adjust
Overwatch,not_removed,im going to play devils advocate here the dude is in plat and is level and only plays torb hes matched up as a team as you meaning overwatch thinks he plays at roughly the same level as you even though he choses not to play other heroes
Overwatch,not_removed,team picks offense a junkrat me sooo i have to choose between being the only tank or the only healer teammate someone switch nobody switches i pick mercy and
Overwatch,not_removed,the thing is every hero in overwatch is really fun to play and i strongly believe that of the players would think that too if they only had the chance to experience it themselves of course everyone has the chance to do so but i guess for every group of players theres some hero much more attractive than the others no matter if its because of the aesthetics the role the skillset or the current state of meta ok so what we got many people play the shit out of certain heros and refuse to try out something new because yeah you know i tried that out once but there was this kicking my ass so that was the worst game ever and this would be cool in quickplay i think people playing competitive should be able to fit into multiple roles and have a deeper understanding of the roaster which both comes from having played most of the roster for some time what do i suggest make the requirement for new players in competitive overwatch the following play every hero for at least hour whats the result imo people will learn the game properly from every possible sight of view for example if you experience the horror of being a healer being focused by flankers all the time youll never forget that and therefore understand the need to support your mercy in future games new players are going to have fun playing diffenrent heros that they would if they werent forced to try out every damn hero remember the hanzogenjiwidow main in your last ranked matched you hated so much in my rainbow sprinkled parallel universe he learned that insert any tank or support hero is actually super fun to play
Overwatch,not_removed,i disagree the point of the game is to have fun and that is fun for them yes they are being a jerk for not being flexible but its not like you are a esports competitor that relies on playing seriously if you want to find more serious matches then find others to queue up with otherwise just accept that people have different definitions of fun and move on
Overwatch,not_removed,git gud
Overwatch,not_removed,see ive seen this a lot of times i just hate meta picks i do i want fun characters that have interesting mechanics and outplay potential and maybe that they are not that popular i play urgot in league of legends for example the thing is its always an uphill battle when you do a niche pick ive had leavers intentional feeders reports threats etc when you have people just constantly playing meta and not promoting diversity people stop knowing how to work around a character and yes i get the comments of why arent you a team player and do what the team wants but i think the blame goes both ways ive had reinhardts telling me im doing nothing while they dont just peel and almost never have the shield up people just give up eventually they start to shift all the blame id like to think that any comp can win against any comp if played to their rightful strengths thats my dream having a well balanced game where you can choose any hero and not have to break your fucking neck just to be able to perform as meta picks
Overwatch,not_removed,i wish people would just shut up about comp man its like youre committing high treason if you dont every game there are other reasons why you lose its very likely that the picks arent the reason you lost cough ability if youre good enough to rise in rank then youre going to rise theres a whole lot of cherry picking and blame game in comp but i guess thats people do
Overwatch,not_removed,suggestion make the requirement for new players in competitive overwatch the following play every hero for at least hour whats the result imo people will learn the game properly from every possible sight of view for example if you experience the horror of being a healer being focused by flankers all the time youll never forget that and therefore be likely to keep an eye on your supports in future games new players are going to have fun playing diffenrent heros that they would if they werent forced to try out every damn hero remember the hanzogenjiwidow main in your last ranked matched you hated so much in my rainbow sprinkled parallel universe he learned that insert any tank or support hero is actually super fun to play
Overwatch,not_removed,haha pc players are so precious there isnt even anybody in game chat until about sr on xbox everyone is just in their own party chats if team comp is shit you just say whatever and have as much fun as possible
Overwatch,not_removed,you know i chalk this up to you guys lost cause you were all worse torb is fine
Overwatch,not_removed,sure however there are quite a few top players who exclusively play hero it really depends on skill level and the skill cap of the hero they are playing
Overwatch,not_removed,will play any character in comp ive practiced all of them and continue to be extremely flexible i main a few phara rein ana in qp im a junkmain wholeheartedly ill switch if we dont take the point or cant get to it or if we get insta wiped while defending but i will start every match with junkrat and expect everyone else to start the match with whatever they feel like too i still want to win in qp but i also want to boop people and trap the reins who charge on me
Overwatch,not_removed,ive played most heroes fairly evenly and can pretty confidently play whatever role is necessary in the moment i get why people pick mains but imo at some point you stop benefiting from being insanely experienced at one character and if your goal is to win more matches then it helps you and your team to have flexibility of course if you are playing as a full group where you are communicating and agree upon each others roles i think that is different but even then playing in a group you could still benefit from flexibility
Overwatch,not_removed,trust me this map is perfect for genji i am really good at pharah trust me sorry im just really bad at tanking let me go back to widow this has been my experience in comp i just sit and wait and always end up picking either a tank or support because its what no one wants to play for some reason
Overwatch,not_removed,the problem about all these matchmaking posts is that every toxic scumbag that these posts are aimed at are not on reddit
Overwatch,not_removed,i picked hero w and my team started asking meto change w is my fav hero and my main and they reported me for never changing my strat and response to enemies regardless of choke point counter picks maptalkseffectiveness and refusing to get together as a team now im here posting on reddit seeking approval love and many upvotes for ruining comp for others players due my stubbornness
Overwatch,not_removed,i dont understand this mentality and those people can literally fuck off and die i dont even care theyre awful human beings
Overwatch,not_removed,i think that you should have a certain amount of time on every hero before you can play comp
Overwatch,not_removed,honestly people who do this do it solely to carry their team cus who hasnt had a dps who couldnt aim or a tank that doesnt even frontline and plays farther back than the supports yes it may be selfish but sometimes people have to carry teams by themselves and id rather be selfish and get flamed by my teammates and win than to fill and probably lose
Overwatch,not_removed,dude theres at least one of these types of players per day most cases way more i dont get the mentality typical scenario goes like this picks widow or hanzo or torb you get the idea when its completely inappropriate team asks them to switch in a very polite manner sometimes in an aggressive or frustrating manner dude goes what am i not allowed to have fun why am i not allowed to play what i want because its horrible for our team comp and torb is shit at attacking capture points proceeds to stay his pick despite getting hard countered by the enemy team too stubborn stupid to switch we lose and the kid through the whole game will just keep going on and on about how he paid for the game same as us and should be able to play how he wants dude nobody is arguing that play how you want go right ahead but dont fucking do it in competitive if you are going to queue up for comp and actively go against the team composition and pick a worthless hero for the task at hand willingly or otherwise and refuse to switch because i can play how i want then you are the problem with this game it tilts me
Overwatch,not_removed,if u dont like what one guy or more pick play in a stack yeee i will be hated for that but is the true
Overwatch,not_removed,people can play the game however the fuck they want they paid bucks for this game just like you maybe you like working with a team and playing good teamheroes more maybe he just likes chilling with torb he must be doing good i guess if hes at your sr playing torb only no one hates me for being a onetrick ana because shes meta why should you blame someone for onetricking another hero
Overwatch,not_removed,i changed recently from an instalock mercy to a versatile flex made a world of difference
Overwatch,not_removed,in general it would be nice if people who didnt want to play with a team didnt play team based games both overwatch and csgo my two favorite games require teamwork especially overwatch sadly i dont think well ever see a day where people on the internet work together in every game it feels like every other game i have people who refuse to switch characters or even just purposefully dont play with the team and lose the game intentionally
Overwatch,not_removed,i would love if everyone mained at least from each category dps supp tank defender i personally excel with pharah mei diva and mercy
Overwatch,not_removed,i play what i want and you cant stop me
Overwatch,not_removed,rant i payed full price for the game ill play any game mode i damn well please
Overwatch,not_removed,i think i was in that game was it eichenwalde did torb and you win
Overwatch,not_removed,i like to play rein my worst nightmare is a team that cant deal with bastion i will occasionally ask people to switch because im often the only tank yesterday i had someone who just talked over me and eventually just told me to stand in front of the bastion so they could shoot in at the other teams bastion who was being protected by a rein wtf
Overwatch,not_removed,yesterday we lost a game that was to be won easily just because no one wanted to play support got a instapick junk and mei and genji eichenwald defense and other guy got soldier me as zarya and other guy as rein after no one budged the soldier was the only one that changed for mercy of course red team came with phara and we had no way to deal with it but they were so bad that capped first point on overtime and they did point only we did well despite the comp but our rein was bad charge in the middle of enemey team without support and so other guy got rein instapick on second round it started a flame war inside the team and we endded without any healer or tank my last resort was to change to symetra and put a tp in a cliff to have some fun at last didnt find the spot in eichenwald attack
Overwatch,not_removed,ya ima play what i want to play but you wont have to deal with me because im in master ive won solo tanking no heals etc its really not hard
Overwatch,not_removed,this is why my mains are pretty flexible in my situations dvamercylucio
Overwatch,not_removed,i will just ask the guy who picked niche hero to show the team what hes got but flexibility is important as well since if theres rein one trick or even lucio one trick on a same team can cause problem
Overwatch,not_removed,if youre getting paired with somebody who only plays torb what does that say about your ability as a player
Overwatch,not_removed,one part that is missing here is that what were your team composition at the time maybe was not only torb faulteven if he switchedyou could easily had lost with a more meta team i mean sometimes you think you have a very well balanced and on point meta team from the start and the other team just does amazing better than you being flexibe at the hero selection is important in a the context of you should know how to play a tank a dps and a healer because i could say oh i dont have great aim and we need a dps i will pick soldier because he is meta and i cant even have a good damage ouput while other person could have been better as soldier or other dps
Overwatch,not_removed,i play with way more people who are so inflexible with offmeta picks they bitch and complain until we lose
Overwatch,not_removed,i swear to god this fucking sub changes its opinion on this from day to day
Overwatch,not_removed,the only thing i really hate is when people go hey can we get a insert healertankdps im just like youre welcome to change
Overwatch,not_removed,when playing with my friends in comp once i almost got to diamond and we played with someone who we saw was very good with tracer so we decided to invite her to the grouponly to later find out that she only played tracer and has literally touched no other hero besides her and some time on widow oh and her friend was the same only he mostly played winston and pretty much couldnt play any other character we asked him to pick hell he even lied to us and to himself that going winston to deal with pharah was a good idea because he can jump up to her to deal damage
Overwatch,not_removed,torb is decent on defense and if that is his best character you are better off letting him play torb than blaming everything on him its not like he was playing torb on offense i usually find that the people who are quickest to ask people to switch and rant are the worst players on the team
Overwatch,not_removed,i love when people lock in genjihanzo and then they tell everyone else what to play if you lock in a hero right at the start you have no right to tell people that they need to play a certain healertank that you want them to play
Overwatch,not_removed,pretty simple for me you can play whatever you want i might suggest to the whole team that we need a second healer or second tank but i wont freak out if people dont switch that being said if you lock into one hero and wont switch you have zero right to tell other people to switch to tell a healer to switch to a different healer to spam thanks or i need healing if things arent going well and so on
Overwatch,not_removed,haha as a soldier and mccree player i hate comp i can either a never choose the one offense hero we need or b never get healed when i decide to be a team player by picking rein or zarya also half the time everyones doing their own things our anas and lucios included idk how you people climb comp is awful id much rather just go have fun in quickplay then get increasingly stressed out at idiots on my team or losing because of my own failures as the tank
Overwatch,not_removed,i dont mind mains and novelty players as long as they arent completely throwing they are an obstaclechallenge to overcome and they remind me not to be too much of a try hard remember you are playing for imaginary points and shiny gold weapons in a video game
Overwatch,not_removed,i mostly pick dva because i main her and so far theres been no problem since im my opinion i play pretty good tbh i can play a huge amount of heroes well just choosing dva is my main go lmao
Overwatch,not_removed,you could also argue that if he always play torb and he is the same rating as you he is doing just as well with torb on attack as you are on soldier
Overwatch,not_removed,your rant wont do anything there will always be people trying to onetrick heroes in any game honestly ive given up on people in general and started assuming people are just retarded or something
Overwatch,not_removed,console player spotted
Overwatch,not_removed,i understand people wanting to play their favorite characters however im still flabbergasted by players who go into competitive without regards to teamwork theres a mode for that its called quick play or people who dont switch when there is something really wrong with the comp and its not working
Overwatch,not_removed,ive been having somewhat of a reinhardt complex trough my whole competetive career from the start rein has been my competetively absolute best hero and no one ever complains even if i pick him of the time however even if i try to play something else our team usually doesnt get a rein as primarysecond tank and i need to switch in the end or the rein we get dives into and switches to a dps after that
Overwatch,not_removed,if hes at your rank playing that character then it should be sufficient if hes above where he should be then hell derank
Overwatch,not_removed,rant if you cant deal with someone who wants to play a according to you bad yet not bannable strategy without complaining on reddit please dont play competitive
Overwatch,not_removed,this sub will defend junkrat players who is absolutely the worst character in the game all day long but when it gets to the off meta hero they dont like they lose their minds
Overwatch,not_removed,i agree one caveat im flexible but if i tell you im particularly weak at a character but proficient enough to use them dont flame me i warned you ahead of time and i was willing to play them just accept the skill level that comes with it if youre asking me to make the change
Overwatch,not_removed,whats the point of these posts youre preaching to the bloody choir do you honestly think people will see this and think theyre the problem this is overwatch theyll always find a reason to not blame themselves
Overwatch,not_removed,i could agree if i knew what stats the torb had in game i know people say medals dont mean anything but any reasonable person can use them to come to conclusions about their own and their teams performance its not common for certain heroes to have gold in certain medals eg soldier has gold healing then what is your ana up too or sombra has gold damage then your bastion isnt up to scratch so when things start to go wrong your team look for the hero in the group who the internet has deemed bad so whilst i agree flexibility is important i really dont want to jump onto the bandwagon that the loss was entirely torbs fault here also its the nature of the internet that people will play the hero they want regardless of your teams choices the stranger on the other side of the country doesnt owe you anything they paid their way into the game like everyone else its shitty i know but its the nature of the beast you cant stop them from picking a hero you cant stop them from playing a certain gamemode the only way to combat it is by stacking in soloq it the will of the gods that you might get everyone on the same page
Overwatch,not_removed,protip if you wanna play comp and rank well know how to play at least one attack hero two tank heroes and one support so you can flip around to other rolls if needed personally i play lucio mainly but i also good at soliderzarya andhog and that keeps me in high diamond so yeah
Overwatch,not_removed,this right here is a double edged sword being a jack of all trades sounds like a great idea but as the saying goes your a master of none id rather a hardcore genji main play genji then he play reinhardt id rather that widow main play widow instead of roadhog but only if they are good at these heros i dont want a shitty genji main or a shitty widow main from my perspective you dont have to be a pro tier player too be able to main a single hero but u do need too be good enough too pull ur weight if ppl try to counter you i personally play almost every dps hero but am atm working on figuring out which dps hero to main ofc it wont stop me from being able to paly the rest of the roster but once ive got that set i will insta lock that hero more and more only swapping under the worst possible situations alot of ppl main heros and never swap because theyre tired of being the ones who are blamed hanzowidow mains know what im talking about regardless of a persons performance they will sometimes get bitched at its not always the non meta pick thats fucking the team over sometimes its another aspect of it maybe your sucks or maybe your rein drops shield every seconds and kills everyone its hard to know why x isnt working but sometimes it is infact because of y the best example of this are genji and tracer both heros with high carry potiental and both rely heavily on there team if said player doesnt out skill the enemy by a large margin the of them require there team to create space space is in the most basic term a distraction when your team is applying so much pressure to the enemy team that u can run in from behind and shoot ppl without them turning around insantly and focusing you this is somthing a few pros have talked about and u even see this at a higher lvl on some streams where the entire enemy team will turn to focus someone as the guys team applys pressure a good genji or tracer could still lose a match at no fault of there own if the rest of your team cannot apply any sort of pressure to the enemy team then your fucked this person swapping will not fix that understanding the why is alot harder then he wont swap while i cant say the torb in question here wasnt at fault probably was its also likely that the team had a key flaw maining a hero isnt out right bad a master of a single hero is just as useful to a team as a person who can play of each roll at a decent lvl were not pros were not playing any true meta were just playing against other average ppl the rules that apply to the pros do not apply to us we dont actually need to swap most of the time the issue is how ppl are playing and not what and swapping never fixes the how
Overwatch,not_removed,in one gibraltr match i went from mercy to mccree to reinhardt rounds vastly different roles and i was able to deliver switching without anyone asking me i was constantly filling as my teammates flipped to whatever role they felt i fill because i know a lot of other players wont but god damn i wish they would consider how selfish theyre being and further how theyre costing themselves wins
Overwatch,not_removed,was this on xbox i think ive played with that guy before we lost of course hes a loser
Overwatch,not_removed,eh the reverse is true though too i cant stand people that tell me to switch before the game has even started but i didnt pick a meta character f i can get the kills sustain the dps hold the point and cover our healers then i will chose what i am comfortable with seems like if i pick junkrat or torb at all people just immediate assume im throwing the game if the other team figures out to counter me i change
Overwatch,not_removed,i usually only play competitive with other friends and sometimes come across this issue of one person not switching but its usually alright because youve got others who are capable characters and players i havent ever really played by myself much in competitive is this really as much of an issue as it seems to be
Overwatch,not_removed,i began looking at my teammates and career profiles in high gold and i found two very troubling things easily of players are onetricks were talking dozens of hours on a single hero and a small handful of minutes on the others if any its not uncommon for my team to end up with two or more otps who happen to be on the same hero and thats where shit hits the fan of the of players that remain about have one main and one off hero and the remaining have more than one off hero or say im a flex player in team chat which instantly sends me into a cold sweat somehow they decide to break out of the onetricking right this instant i cannot explain that without involving supernatural notions im convinced im hallucinating or going insane what i said above this seems to fly out the window most of the time when i start playing we get three rein otps in the match simultaneously they get the bright idea of not picking rein without a word said none of that i usually play rein but ill take x so we can do y stuff i am fully aware this sounds completely batshit insane i wish i could make sense of it but i cant i honestly have no clue whats going on here some choices are okish in terms of starting the team out with the good ol meta or the trusty triple tank but more often than not the choices are questionable a zarya otp who decides to pick hanzo somebody with an overwhelming majority of hours on roadhog decides to pick genji when hes only got some minutes of experience on him in qp and the list goes on i encountered only one exception a teammate who asked us not to pay attention to what the profile indicated because he was on his smurf account still somebody explain this to me because right now i feel like i am under some crazyass voodoo spell or something
Overwatch,not_removed,this sounds like a guy i came across a month ago only with less rage wanted to be torb on attack in kings row okay i think hes an experienced plat level so ill give him the benefit of the doubt then he sets up his turret facing the choke then he starts complaining that the rest of the team is doing poorly then he starts bitching about team comp and how were not protecting him when i tell him that torb just isnt cutting it right now he went absolutely batshit started screaming about how he had the most damage etc i told him he had the most damage because his turret is just puttering away at reins shield and zaryas bubbles hes not actually doing anything he then tells me that he knows how the fucking game works and started screaming about how no one understands the game and how hes always saddled with horrible teammates it was really astounding
Overwatch,not_removed,yeah fuk u hanjo
Overwatch,not_removed,yesterday i was playing on oasis it was already and this fucking guy thought it was a good idea to pick junkrat against a pharah and a genji guess who won the game fuck this shit
Overwatch,not_removed,yo it is cool to ask them not to do this on reddit and everything but lets be honest it is going to happen so you have to enable it and not play around it to win if you get salty and try to make a team comp outside of the torb pick to compensate then you will lose if they guy doesnt change then make picks based off the torb pick
Overwatch,not_removed,as much as i hate people who do this you cant stop people from playing a gamemode they enjoy and you cant stop them from not playing heroes they dont like all heroes are viable choices when you arent a pro so if your teammate wont work with you you work with him otherwise youre just accepting the loss for no reason
Overwatch,not_removed,honestly sometimes i do this its because of the time i get forced into healer or tank thats all i know how to play so occasionally tanks and healers will already be picked so i still go winston nobody ever lets me go dps so that random time i have to be dps is a loss
Overwatch,not_removed,do not underestimate someone who plays only one hero for example i play dva only and i mean it with dva only havent played anything else yet in ranked not even under a minute this season also i got master and i am on my way to grand master read it up here p tldr everyone has the right to play what they think is good as long as you are not intentionally trolling
Overwatch,not_removed,you know i ran into a guy in qp the other day who was level something checked his profile and he was only at bronze his highest comp score ever was also bronze and had dozens of hours on half the heroes i really have to wonder how you get to the point where you have played so many hundreds of hours of the game and you still cant play it well eventually you would think youd just have it all ingrained right
Overwatch,not_removed,as expected we couldnt even cap the first point and lost thats the incorrect expectation hes as good with only playing torb as you are switching to whichever hero you think fits the match best
Overwatch,not_removed,i believe you can main a hero if they good on of mapsgame modes and you have a good win rate with them im talking heros like soldierzaryalucio where they can fit just about every comp i personally main zarya and play her of the time and have a rate with her at at the moment
Overwatch,not_removed,lol did this nub just find out what comp really is
Overwatch,not_removed,if youre not able to main at least one hero in each category dont even play comp
Overwatch,not_removed,i dont think ive played solider since season started cant remember it anyway people keep telling me im a mercy main from my new stats
Overwatch,not_removed,for me in comp as long as they are being helpful i dont mind who they plat ie a widow attack whos sniping the shit out of the enemy team but if they become unhelpful widow on attack doing badly or something just isnt working and we need to counter pick i think just ask nicely dont be a dick to people when asking them to switch
Overwatch,not_removed,my standard match partners refer to this as the nope playing hanzo school of thought no matter what map no matter offense or defense no matter team composition nope playing hanzo
Overwatch,not_removed,this is exactly why i dont fuck with competitive unless i roll in with a premade or stack but as for quickplayi believe people witness the true meaning of rage when playing quickplay my average night on qp a love story opening scene me alright lets do this team picks heroes mcree genji tracer sombra widow me fuck fin
Overwatch,not_removed,had a guy say he will only play pharah and that his stats show he gets around eliminations a game so a friend picked him and this guy began to cry on the mic and play widow on lijong tower when we lost the guy messaged me saying if we kindly asked him to switch back he would have honestly i dont understand these people self sabotaging themselves in comp
Overwatch,not_removed,god this is currently my biggest issue with comp right now i had an attack bastion on numbani yesterday who would just get shut down before he could ever set up when we kindly asked him to switch to help us cap the point and he could go bastion right after and chill on the payload we got cursed right out we lost that match despite only having to cap the point and moving the payload feet go play quickplay you jerk
Overwatch,not_removed,happened to me with a widow on kings row
Overwatch,not_removed,but how will i ever become a top junkrat main
Overwatch,not_removed,back when i was a plat i ended up on the team of someone who mained torb everyone was ready to tilt and throw but i tried to devise a strategy to get torb to work we had a good attack and i managed to help a lot as lucio by pushing people to their deathsfirst point hanamura we tried and failed the second point if we wouldve gotten a footing im sure we couldve taken the point turret on the high ground is strong on attack but a difficult strategy for sure people were of course upset again but i told them he was the same sr they were and that he had invested a lot of hours into torb and if we got it to work on atk surely we can dominate on defense i dont remember what i played on the defending round this was many seasons ago but we held the point and won i bet the enemy team were tilted as fuck did i carry did torb carry was the enemy team throwing i dont think any of those assumptions ring true he played atk torb at a level that was fine for plats not an optimal strat for sure its an offmeta pick esp on that map and in the meta that was used back then i met him on control point and lost he played torb on ilios but he also played zenyatta because he wasnt a torb only account he had a significant amount of time invested in torb yes but could play zenyatta and other characters he was willing to play other heroes if he hadnt been i doubt hed find someone to queue with and he was in a duoqueue whats the moral of the story well either its that this torb worked because he wasnt a torb only account or its that the torb op is talking about shouldnt be in platinum to begin with but tbh i think it all boils down to another problem if we assume everyone belong at the sr they are in so im a bit above and play with people around that sr yet i see dps players who arent doing as well as youd expect of a diamond player sometimes i play mccree and i miss all my fucking shots it happens even to the best of us usually when people see these things they wish their teammates would rank down to plat or gold or that they should play lucio or something weve been there ive been the one to ask people to go lucio or rein or whatever ive even been the one to switch off my main in order to play the lucio cause im not having a good day and thats what i think happens a lot people are not consistent sometimes people play badly and lose games but i do think that people around your sr are in most even comparable to your skill id want them to switch if theyre having a bad day like a mercy i played with yesterday who managed to res one person out of three dead and that was the only res we got that game but i dont think theyre bad players and i dont think they should feel like me asking someone to switch is an attack on their person i dont think torb mains are undeserving of playing competitive some of my favourite streamers and players are xonly accounts like chro kolor or grumblehog ultimately its a game and ultimately its about fun if kolor isnt very good at aiming with moving characters like but good at positioning and tracking let him play bastion he went top dont tell me he shouldnt play because hes not flexible what im getting at here is theres more nuance to this than you might think i never see it acknowledged either its torb mains are taxic pls blöck them or its this torb main is a god maybe people main certain characters because thats what theyre good at and thats what they play well as maybe a plat torb main wont carry you into masters but at least he can play torb in plat level and have fun right
Overwatch,not_removed,omg this this this this this and this again just play qp if you dont wanna coordinate with your team why ruin the fun for everyone trying to get a dub cmmmmooooooonn people
Overwatch,not_removed,what was the situation that caused his torbjorn play to be ineffective and thus cause the loss also did you have a chance to look at his winrate with torb in competitive across the various seasons
Overwatch,not_removed,or if you pick widow cause no one kills the pharah while you were healer just leave i dont need you in my game you dont kill pharah and you dont help
Overwatch,not_removed,just as bad as the genjis who are diving into winston and dva comps and dying instantly and never switching you arent doing anything please change
Overwatch,not_removed,lost games in a row from torb mains that insisted on playing him on defense and offense without placing turrets or dropping armor feelsgoodman
Overwatch,not_removed,im a sym main because ive found that shes the only hero for which i have any aptitude and shes the only hero that i have fun playing when im asked to switch i try to present the case that we will almost certainly be worse off if im forced to play anyone else i know its a team game and ive made the effort to learn the basics of a handful of other heroes but i am certain regardless of the existing comp that you would rather have me playing my main than playing anyone else the team element is obviously important to winning and im flexible about a lot of things including accepting input on turret position whether to go tpshield gen how to approach the objective etc etc but my hero choice is my own other players are free to share their input but i know that me as notsym is always bad news for the team
Overwatch,not_removed,the issue i have with comp right now is the inconsistency and the unfavourable sr gainslosses for me for instance today i lost a teammate who left immediately after on oasis to which i lost points and next game won fair and square and won points ive constantly gained and lost since season started so despite my higher than winrate ive been on stalemate for quite some time its really annoying checked the leavers sr loss and he lost around the same imo they should lose twice as more if they leave
Overwatch,not_removed,instalock defense genji doesnt respond to either voice or text chat has eliminations the entire game switches to bastion on offense
Overwatch,not_removed,this is why this game sucks ass it just flat out isnt fun when out of games at least one person tries the match without playing with a group of other friends this game is absolutely cancer
Overwatch,not_removed,shoopa dlug tuskyum wakka ligg qxet yaush jeill ov
Overwatch,not_removed,we had the same problem with a genji the other team had several genji counters and even though we were very close to winning on the backs of the rest of the team an extra tank of pharah would have made a world of difference
Overwatch,not_removed,in season i played zarya rein zen mercy and lucio more than any other characters i did everything i could to work with the team in order to climb the ladder but you know what im just a lowly gold sometimes going into plat player im never going to climb to masters or become mlg prostatus and if anything i found myself getting bored of the characters i was playing and i often switched back and forth between them because i didnt really find them to be all that fun playing comp was miserable so this season you know what i did i instapicked genji for practically every game i started off at and within week i broke my record high even though i was playing a character that wasnt meta and often triggers teammates i got yelled at more often than i ever did as any other character but in actuality i contributed much more to my team than i did playing meta heroes i was actually able to flank and kill healers something that i couldnt do with any of the other characters i was playing sure i didnt have shiny gold elims or damage medals all the time either but i got kills that meant something and helped the rest of the team even if they didnt realize it but the best part of it all despite all the hate and toxicity i got i freaken loved playing genji hes my most favorite character by far and i enjoy comp much more when i play him and for all the ragers that wanted to blame me for the loss and that i sucked well guess what i got to the same skill rating to be placed in the same matches as them playing the character i supposedly sucked at once you stop blaming other teammates and just focus on your own play and what you can do the game becomes so much more enjoyable im not a onetrickpony either im just someone who really enjoys playing genji at plat level thats how games should be played by definition theyre supposed to be fun sure ill try in comp but i wont sweat it if i lose
Overwatch,not_removed,i wish junkrat was meta
Overwatch,not_removed,consider the possibility that it isnt the off meta pick that is making you lose games but the stigma and tilting that comes with it your teammates can play whatever they want and so can you you are the only constant across all of your games stop blaming others for your losses
Overwatch,not_removed,torbjorn is awesome on defense if i cant get anywhere with torb on defense i know there is a problem elsewhere sorry thats just the way of it i am better with his gun than i am on to take down pharahs even i can solo tanks and hes got a freaking aimbot turret i switch to something different on attack simply because of the salt factor but if the salt factor is already in play why bother thats exactly what youre lvl plat was thinking onetricks are not cool but theyre all over the ranks anyway meta and offmeta not much you can do about it
Overwatch,not_removed,i agree players should be flexible but flexibility goes both ways demanding that someone play ana instead of mercy is just dumb and yet it has happened to me and then the guy threw a hissy fit when i wouldntt switch i am awful with ana
Overwatch,not_removed,today we were playing in a stack at elo games in a row the randoms insta locked torbsymgenjihanzo every fucking time most of them didnt even have hour playtime on these heroes when we politely asked them to pick something helpful for the team were they are good at they just ignored us i have no problem with people who want to play certain heroes but then they should at least have a little bit playtime and experience on them and talk to us about that this shit pissed me of so hard and imo people like them should be excluded for the rest of the season after a certain amount of reports if this game wants to be taken seriously and grow they have to be stricter with the rules for the competitive mode and with penalties when you break them
Overwatch,not_removed,im so sorry that you got him ive played with him or someone like him i have no god damn clue how he got to platinum thats the kind of player that belongs in that bracket they wont stop playing competitive its how they get their kicks its up to blizzard to intervene or maybe their sense of human decency to kick in the only way to get past it is to know theyre deeply unhappy and unloved and uncommon who ever that person is he needs therapy
Overwatch,not_removed,just because torb is generally a garbage pick doesnt mean probably something
Overwatch,not_removed,i lose more games because people play characters they arent familiar with than because of onetricks honestly
Overwatch,not_removed,lmao reminds me on one comp game where nobody wanted to go tank and i was mercy tried telling them we need a tank if we wanted to win this one guy said but tanks and supports are for noobs
Overwatch,not_removed,ive been getting the worst luck in teams lately and frequently seems to be two instalock dps that are the source of the problem i had a symmetra main last night trying to call out my healing when the problem was that the enemy was not going down fast enough and as a result we were being steamrolled in the same match our freaking tanks and my friend playing zenyatta were the ones taking gold elims and damage dps was practically doing shit but attack sym who averages less than elims per game has to be the perfect choice huh im totally okay with the bad heroes as long as they can play them but if they cant they really should try to help
Overwatch,not_removed,well you have to deal with it sometimes i play competitive for fun not always for try hard whatever hero i will chose im doing my best to play good not going to troll anything but sometimes i just dont feel like playing healer or tank and im picking hanzogenji whatever because i also want to have fun but this is only if i can chose first if theres already dps even if i want to play genjo or whatever il try to fit with a tank or healer but not going to ruin a comp like that but if i had first tobj for example deal with it
Overwatch,not_removed,i dont have a problem with people being one tricks im in diamond its not the best rank sure but i assume you are playing that hero cause you expect to get results whats frustrating is when people are not able to deliver results but will not switch because they cannot have time on another character on that account nobodies gonna look down on you cause you have minutes on your junkrat only account theres situations where even reinhardt isnt effective and hes one of the most played heroes across all decisions its been said from the start hero switching is a core mechanic to the game you can build an entire composition to counter a player whos doing really well on a hero even still i dont care if your a sym main and the enemy picks up pharah to deal with you do long as your still getting shit done for example sym flanked the enemy and got a kill on a supportbackline dps and then died to pharah thats fine youve still contributed to the team if youve died several times and not had any significant impact during those points you are hurting your own chance of climbing
Overwatch,not_removed,when i see people who instalock a dumb hero widow or hanzo on attack or junkrat when we already know the enemy team has a pharah then i tend to look at that players career profile even if they main that hero odds are they have a reasonable amount of hours on some other heroes so i look at what their next most played is and if its roadhog i say hey could you maybe go roadhog i think that would be good and quite often theyll change yes i know widow or hanzo is not always necessarily bad but at my level currently it is more often than not and there are usually better choices my point is if you look at what else they might be happy to play and then ask them nicely you get a much better response typically than if youre shouting change noob
Overwatch,not_removed,i play what i want instalocks mercy
Overwatch,not_removed,pro tip if youre not a meta slave youll win more games
Overwatch,not_removed,they should make an option to avoid as teammate when you dont want to que with someone in the future
Overwatch,not_removed,ok
Overwatch,not_removed,instead of blaming him increasing tensions and reducing your chance to win try building a team around him to increase your chance of winning boo hoo someone will only play a specific character all you can do is deal with it and make the best of a bad situation in the end the loss is on you grow up its only a video game if he only has fun with torb who cares deal with it or stop playing dont whine to reddit about it no one cares
Overwatch,not_removed,junkrat main never switching deal w it
Overwatch,not_removed,no thanks i will continue to play sombra of the time and muting ragers i have a positive winrate and have climbed to diamond doing it as much as you want to blame your teammates it is not their fault you are losing
Overwatch,not_removed,i agree its annoying but people are free to play whatever they want
Overwatch,not_removed,when you cant wait for the release of turret simulator
Overwatch,not_removed,why not this fucking otp is the same elo as you so whatever hes doing is working just as well as what youre doing so instead of going on reddit to put the blame on those players for your last loss maybe try to get better than them so you dont have to play with them anymore
Overwatch,not_removed,ya i mean im a tank main but have second most playtime with healers i can play dps well as well whenever needed but my friends usually fill that spot but i get in so many games with people who play one character and its the most retarded characters all the time like sym only mains torb only mains junkrat only mains happening so much this season wtf and so on i really dont mind these characters at all but come on its just obvious when people dont care about winning or losing and are just throwing
Overwatch,not_removed,welcome to the world of competitive trolls friend people who you win games with group and play with them less chance of down syndrome babies who refuse to work with the team i dropped over sr this season because of trolls climbed back up so far by only playing with people who work together
Overwatch,not_removed,how about you just play around the person instead of bellyaching all day thats the key difference between good players and toxic players
Overwatch,not_removed,would you complain if he strictly played reinhardt or ana
Overwatch,not_removed,being flexible doesnt mean playing what you specifically want i can play lucio pharah symmetra and dva right now im focusing on symmetra if i pick her and we literally dont have a healer ill swap if midmatch im not performing well ill also swap what i wont do is swap because someone who has no idea about my play style thinks symmetry doesnt work on attack
Overwatch,not_removed,ran into a stack all diamond that played dva rein and orisa every round it worked for a little bit but once the team countered they rolled us because the tanks didnt switch
Overwatch,not_removed,they need to block defends heroes for players below diamond
Overwatch,not_removed,torb and symmetra main is ok they even have their own subreddit genji hanzo and widow main are the problem according to this sub
Overwatch,not_removed,well if there were other ways to get golden guns i wouldnt play comp
Overwatch,not_removed,hahahaha get rektd scrub
Overwatch,not_removed,pay for my game and maybe i wont but for now going to continue playing only one hero
Overwatch,not_removed,yeah so i have to put twice as many hours on this game to main a few different characters no thank you people shouldnt have to stick to qp just because they only main one character
Overwatch,not_removed,i was shat on yesterday for sticking to reaper in quick play i mean where am i supposed to practice new heroes if not in quick play comp is the other thing though i totally agree with you you have to have a roster of at least heroes with different roles in your arsenal unless you are playing in the lowest of ranks
Overwatch,not_removed,i expect you to work around me lets stop saying that it doesnt make sense do you have to work around your healers because they need los to heal you is it a specific case with certain heroes no you always try and play around the strengths of your team if youre busy arguing or telling others how to play you are the real problem
Overwatch,not_removed,deleted
Overwatch,not_removed,many players who instalock some heroes dont realize they are being carried all the way from bronze to whtever rank they are a single strategy wont work of your career games im dying to see one of those i xhero of the times and all teammates rage winning matches and ranking in a team with torb player sombra player hanzo player and a widowmaker player who are not going to switch ever and no healers at all because no one will play as such nbsp it would be funny seeing them trying to cap hanamura first lol
Overwatch,not_removed,great example in gold was playing with a friend playing attack as pharah wasnt doing great as pharah but my team never seemed to be able to push past the first choke i was flanking and making opportunities but they had a torb turret and a symmetra that were making it hard for me plus the tanks kept dying instantly i got pharah you aint doing shit switch switch to what i have gold elims and damage and my only decent support is mercy and shes taken plus we have tanks anyway got heaps of shit next round switch to rein we need a rein well guys i have about seconds on rein if someone else can switch i can go healer or dva the response was you cant just play one character and not be flexible rein isnt hard you just hold down right click button anyway i went dva on defense we held the first point due to me and my buddy who is a mercy main and who got potg and both cards me and my friend they were not nice about the whole thing either completely arrogant and disgusting and they did terribly one was a solider the entire time and never touched my damage or elims god it was satisfying i should add that after they whined about needing a rein none of them switched to rein i held that point as a dva with my defense matrix and a hog
Overwatch,not_removed,i hate it when we have a good team comp but people are picky about what tanks and healers they get and they complain about it before the match has even started im not good with lucio but im a really good zen why would you want your team player to play a hero hes not proficient in im profiecient in a lot of heros but not all like i suck at lucio and lucio is what people want all the time people make me switch and then also complain when i dont speed boost right i quit playing comp i fucking hate it mercy isnt very good anymore could you play ana hanzo roadhog sucks play zarya genji why would you play mercy on this map fucking love this comment i got one time most memorable comp mode comment
Overwatch,not_removed,you put into words why i dont play any more
Overwatch,not_removed,if can get other semiflexible proficient on heroes tryhards who are communicating and is just generally willing to work with me as i them on my team every game i would be happy to lose every game comp is just simply more fun for me that way if i know that everyone on my team is doing the best they can and making the best pickplay they can im happy even if we lose
Overwatch,not_removed,people will do whatever it takes to avoid admitting that they belong at their current rank its always everyone elses fault thats why people dont like to its not that its more difficult it isnt its that theres no scapegoat when you lose
Overwatch,not_removed,this is the most ridiculous bs ive ever read on this sub if my teammates dont try to win there is no level of skill well maybe skill that could carry the game even if i get solo kills then die my team sometimes cant even kill the remaining players please enlighten me what can i do about that will you tell me to git gut and dont die like that post basically says your performance doesnt matter your winrate doesnt mean anything if your team cant play as a team
Overwatch,not_removed,this looks like it has a hint of truth because it is written well but mainly this just sounds like a douchebag trying to justify himself online competitive gaming has social contracts that start as soon as you join the game even if theyre unwritten
Overwatch,not_removed,tldr you worry about your shit and let your teammates worry about their shit your team is not a bunch of bots and you dont have any right to tell them what to do
Overwatch,not_removed,i would argue but just go to the thread to see the counterpoints that post is sensationalist garbage
Overwatch,not_removed,this post was made by someone who only plays one character and is looking for any bs reason to justify it they dont owe you a win is mind boggingly stupid
Overwatch,not_removed,you are wrong its a team game and unfortunately im forced to play who whatever the game matches i agree with you but dont tell me the guys who pick and wont switch are right
Overwatch,not_removed,false look at an allstar athlete on a poor team theres only so much they can do to help the team win its a team sport game and it requires a full and cooperative team to be successful
Overwatch,not_removed,fuck this
Overwatch,not_removed,this is a well written post that completely fails to address anything the op is talking about
Overwatch,not_removed,this quote directly contradicts itself two paragraphs go on to explain how you have zero control over your teammates then apparently all of that is a statical anomaly and will not prevent your climb if you the individual constant have the skill to climb this really sounds like a quote from someone whos a grand master or simply delusional because otherwise its ridiculously unrealistic beyond sheer luck when placed with random teammates or youre grand master in skilllevel in which case yeah its probably a more realistic goal to carry a team every game using that exact logic if i personally have the sole ability to make the difference on a team then a trolluncooperative player also has the direct ability to make a difference in the opposite direction too
Overwatch,not_removed,we will continue to bitch about it why because they are fully autonomous random people who owe you nothing and couldnt care less about you
Overwatch,not_removed,what if you have a team with onetrick reins though you gon lose
Overwatch,not_removed,the whole idea of switching heroes during the game is to change your composition if things are not working out it couldve been any hero no matter how meta they are if somebody is just dying over and over without accomplishing anything i think it is reasonable to switch if you dont wanna switch if you are doing poorly you shouldnt play overwatch because that is a core mechanic of the game
Overwatch,not_removed,i do dislike trick reins when we have a comp where literally no one except like a mercy is using the shield the reinhardt just becomes a waste of space when we have a team which is built around flanking or something i even think trick anas can be a pain when we have multiple of them no one should be a trick
Overwatch,not_removed,i only play zennyatta and no one has ever complained
Overwatch,not_removed,well no shit rein and ana are two of the most useful heroes in the game there are very few situations where you wouldnt want one on your team
Overwatch,not_removed,and toblerone is a niche pick so understandable although having reinhardt one tricks in a team can be shit as well
Overwatch,not_removed,i would if someone else picked reinanna and then they deliberately threw the game because that is all they can play or if they picked anna as a third healer rein as a third tank the circumstances are more limited but being a one hero player sucks
Overwatch,not_removed,which makes me wonder why cant blizzard just buff or fix the heroes that arent meta round out their kit a little more so they are more useful in different situations junkrat torb and widowmaker could all use some balancing love
Overwatch,not_removed,you wont see anyone bitching about someone being a one trick rein or a one trick ana because theyre useful in almost every comp well yeah obviously but the fact of the matter is when you die repeatedly you should be asking yourself is my hero pick really relevant here in of scenarios the answer is yes for rein but for someone like torb its about of the time
Overwatch,not_removed,as a otp rein i can say that the only time i get yelled at is when someone else wants to play rein in which case i let them and if they ever switch off back to hammer bro i go unless im really digging the roadhog or dva im playing as for the current game
Overwatch,not_removed,until you end up with two onetrick reins anas on the same team and they start arguing with each other in spawn
Overwatch,not_removed,you said it right there theyre useful also if they dont switch when they do bad or arent useful then yes i do get mad at them
Overwatch,not_removed,you can pretty much get away of the time with one tricking ana reinhardt lucio zen mercy zarya soldier and kinda mccree because theyre the heroes that are at least viable on most comps solo q players are comfortable with
Overwatch,not_removed,actual pro tip dont switch to heroes youre not comfortable on because a budget seagull told you so
Overwatch,not_removed,you are not allowed to bitch though if you ask me to move to a character i cant play no problem with that but what i hate is when im asking someone to switch to a different hero and they completely ignore me instead of communicating with me and saying they cant play that hero or are only good with the hero they picked that is whats annoying me and probably most people
Overwatch,not_removed,agreed although i do have certain characters i just cant use but i play over half the cast so i can usually fill most roles
Overwatch,not_removed,right it frustrates the hell out of me when people lock a role thats awful for the current comp and go its my main or someone picks their tank and they go i cant play any other tanks i only play like if youre gonna join comp knowing hero from each role and expect to do well you are bad
Overwatch,not_removed,and that rest of us asked him politely part sounds mighty suspicious
Overwatch,not_removed,the thing is that it doesnt matter if you win changing heroes is a great thing to do if you are not winning because a different comp might do better versus whatever the opponents have you dont change a winning team it is just like real sports if a player is doing poorly you can bench him so that another player might make the difference today in comp i had a widow who by all standards couldnt hit a shot both my team and the enemy team made comments about it the only ones that didnt were the people in widows group widow didnt change because we were bad i might not be grandmaster but that is of course a bs answer
Overwatch,not_removed,as a pharah player i can tell you hero selection absolutely matters ive won hundreds of games because of it
Overwatch,not_removed,arrgg i dont agree with the hero selection not being a problem heroes in this game are build to cunter each other and if enemy team has pharahjunk etc that counters thorb then it wont be so smart to keep the thorb you do need to be flexible in this game i have played many games where my team turn it around because we simply change some of the heroes to counter the other team ex if enemy has a realy good genji or tracer how much will rein or roadhog help u need maybe dva or winston things like this
Overwatch,not_removed,tldr people are entitled selfish pricks
Overwatch,not_removed,debatable i know many people who would be bitching that they won in spite of the torb player
Overwatch,not_removed,i agree wholehearted with you i had similar experiences with offheroes players the problem is not picking a niche hero the problem is never ever switching when you are clearly not being effective
Overwatch,not_removed,bastion is a total carry hero in good hands i have carried my team in diamond with bastion and im not even a bastion main the key is just to sentry and focus down the reinhardt shield hard after that your team has the advantage
Overwatch,not_removed,you still get this there to some extent though i play mostly mage support im not high by any means silver but i know i can win lane as a mage support the annoying thing is all the team want you to play tank i dont usually do bad as a tank but we barely ever snowball lane so im basically just flipping a coin
Overwatch,not_removed,team composition can absolutely be one of those mistakes especially when someone refuses to switch i try to look at my play critically just as you say but sometimes youre not the one thats the problem sometimes if youre the one to switch to counter a dominant opponent youre leaving your team out to dry particularly if you switch off of tankhealer in an even game a one trick pony can easily cost you a game and if youre at or near the rank you belong youre not going to be able to overcome it
Overwatch,not_removed,thank you its so easy to assume that the game comes down to merely who chooses what hero but the actual plays and actions of each member of the team make way more of a difference case in point i was playing on route last night with mostly dps mains but we had various people mixandmatching to compensate one of the dps guys went mercy and i could notice the difference immediately maybe im just spoiled on good mercy mains but his rezzes were bad his boostinghealing wasnt welltimed etc and i feel that just letting him go dps and me solohealing wouldve worked out better overall people think that the right comp is an instant win button and that the wrong one implies the opposite but you have to actually look at the skill set of each individual player in order to determine what is best for the team
Overwatch,not_removed,i want them to learn to cooperate with their team though which means getting good with a few different heroes rather than plonk themselves into a dps slot and refuse to ever leave it even if theyre getting owned like weve a winston annihilating our healers constantly could one of the dps go reaper no no one willing to take the hero that will easily counter the hero that is wrecking us i dont care how good a junkrat and genji our dps obsessives are we need a reaper i will do it if you wont but i cant switch off ana and youre just not listening or willing to cooperate so we lose because you went into the only explicitly teamworkmandatory mode in a game with like ten game modes and refuse to engage in team work the best genji in the world is not going to be the winston counter that we need
Overwatch,not_removed,then let the otp play lucio and just exist why would you put a one trick torb to do dps or tank obviously he is gonna suck thats why he is a otp i would rather have an existing lucio than a torb that is simply not working due to being countered
Overwatch,not_removed,i always let people have a chance to use their mains but if its not working then obviously im going to say something not flame them just suggest them to change now im also a genji main but the difference between you and me is that i change if asked its not about staying in a rank and never climb because you are somewhat good its about understanding that this is a team game and some people would like to win and climb the ladder if they are being nice to you despite refusing to change why would you be an asshole to them and not try another hero if your main is not currently working it makes no sense i dont get the whole i bought this game so i can do whatever the fuck i want even if that results on people not enjoying the game its not about that you are allowed to play a game because you bought it and the only thing that matters is you having fun we live in a society you cant act as if the world belongs to you
Overwatch,not_removed,you wont find me switching to tanks or healers then youre a bad team player
Overwatch,not_removed,this exact mentality is exactly why you shouldnt play competitive competitive exists to win not to have fun youre only hindering other people that are actually trying to win assuming youre solo play a non competitive game that doesnt require teamwork please
Overwatch,not_removed,it is if someone picks him before you
Overwatch,not_removed,no because lucio works and does not need to be build around him the problem with otp comes when they play some really niche heroes that dont have carry potential some examples for this are symm torb and bastion some of the times because while being niche he has carry potential now if we have a one trick genji thats getting countered by a winston he has more chances of pulling his weight because the hero he plays is all around good this is not true for a hero like torbjorn who relies in his turret if every time he sets a turret it gets instantly destroyed then he is just being useless for the team now you could say but daaaad torbs gun is very good and yeah its good for being a niche hero its like mercys gun which is good for being a healer its just that those guns are nowhere as good as a meta dps if you are playing a turretless torb you might aswell change to mccree or even hanzo hope i explained it
Overwatch,not_removed,he just lost and he wanna blame something for it p
Overwatch,not_removed,doesnt apply to reinhardt lucio mercy ana soldier dva pharah and a few more in my experience it doesnt matter if your contributing absolutely jack shit as long as your on a character the team deems worthy youre doing good and theres no need to change
Overwatch,not_removed,curious what your rank is i have played with many torbs in platinum on defense and it has worked great more times than it hasnt only a few times have i seen a torb work well on offense
Overwatch,not_removed,wait why do you jump so much
Overwatch,not_removed,i can carry the whole team and i still get blamed heh this really does underline how bullshit goes both ways as a gm player im here to tell you with no degree of uncertainty that youd be surprised how often you think youre carrying but are actually being enabled by someone elses pick effectively meaning you are being carried yourself the rest of the time you have to jump around like an idiot dont spam jump spamming jump makes your movement predictable the fact that youre recommending jumpspamming already by default tells me that yes the majority of loses you have can and are attributed to very very poor reasoning and decision making torb is a viable pick if played correctly you dont seem to understand what viable means anything in the world is viable because it doesnt instantly explode as soon as you pick it that doesnt mean there isnt objectively better choices because there are what youre saying here is running with one leg can work if i practice enough like ok yeah it can work but having two legs sure beats the fuck out of limping if someone refuses to switch deal with it and try to work around with stubborn people so are you calling yourself stubborn because id add selfcentered to that competitive games are about winning winning is fun doing whatever we can to win is fun thats what makes competition fierce and fun but still playing this game made me realize a serious thing in life everyone always thinks its not their fault everyone always blames others just to feel better ive never heard im sorry that was my fault maybe i did but i dont recall that ever happening not once in this gigantic wall of text did you utter these words i know torbjörn is a suboptimal pick and that does get me in trouble a lot but even if im responsible for losses i still like to play him all you did was whine that people didnt want you to force them to build around them when they might not necessarily have the hero pool for it hypocrite lol
Overwatch,not_removed,your turret is completely disposable yes this guy understands torb torb is one of my post played heros in qp but less so in comp because the team rage is palpable but unjustified the rank turret is so extremely underrated its sad if your turret goes down and you are more than seconds away from the optimal spot for it you drop a where you are at of the time then move your turret when you can also the only time you should upgrade that turret is if there is no immediate threat and you would otherwise not be doing anything
Overwatch,not_removed,but you didnt contribute to a discussion either does that mean you are not better than the people in roverwatch or are you better just because you pointed out what everyone already knows
Overwatch,not_removed,this is pretty much it too many people think they are big chief when they are little indian i dont care if they play symmetra or junkrat if they enforce their will and control the game to some degree
Overwatch,not_removed,i think this does make sense im not going to ask someone with hours on mccree to switch from mccree or at least wont consider doing so lightly its not that they should determine the team comp but rather if they are mastering one hero but not getting much experience on others why not let them play as that hero i play as genji quite a bit in competitive but if i wind up in a match with or seagull on my team not that i ever would mind you and they want to play as genji i dont see a reason i should deny that for them andor pick genji myself however i think theres a misconception with maining a hero what determines how well you do is how much time you have playing the game not which hero youre playing as so to speak of course someone playing the game for hours isnt going to do as well as someone playing it for hours and of course someone with hours on junkrat wont do as well as someone with hours on junkrat thats not to say there arent exceptions but generally experience is what matters the most not how that experience was gained so while someone playing for hours across all heroes and someone playing for hours as one hero should be relatively the same skill the only difference is one has gone for mastering a hero while the other has gone for basically being a jack of all trades honestly so long as the player is good on the hero theyre playing as i dont really mind which hero they play as if they have hours on hanzo but are a great hanzo thats good if they have hours on and thats their highest on a single hero id much rather they play as than reinhardt say
Overwatch,not_removed,i have found that is easier to win if you dont build around them and just hope that your team can play a why because if you build around a otp one simple counter in the enemy team makes your whole comp useless and not only that making you play around a otp only makes it so you cant most of the time play your best heroes
Overwatch,not_removed,this is the problem as i see it with one trick players it is just as unfair to ask a one trick to switch as it is for a one trick to expect five other people to build a team around them which is often what the situation requires if you have a one trick bastion player you can make an incredibly effective team if you build around the bastion but why in the world should five people have to subsume their desires into the will of one person i always encourage my team to build around one tricks because it is both polite and the most advantageous thing my team can do with victory in mind but i should not be beholden to the selfish desires of one person on my team and one tricks require this moreso than most other players
Overwatch,not_removed,and he is slow head and projectile based mccree plays pretty much like that with some advantages over a turretless torb
Overwatch,not_removed,i agree i have quite a few games on torb this season and ive learned a lot attacking with him though i dont attempt it does make it easier to get his scrap because youre usually pushing into a location to get it when youre defending its a lot easier to miss out on scrap because sometimes the enemy will die outside of your defense and its too risky to get scrap unless you get a full team wipe also putting your turret farther back is usually better as well as relocating it frequently you dont want to leave it in one spot and keep replacing it in the same location or else youre both exposes and predictable
Overwatch,not_removed,totally i understand some people are on their game losing streak of the day and just want to win win win but ive really begun to appreciate innovative picks the more i play not only just because ive lost to my fair share of attack torbs but it also is a nice change up to not play by a textbook every single game
Overwatch,not_removed,i main widowmaker on console im constantly carrying my team youre welcome
Overwatch,not_removed,let me put it this way this sub is like an echochamber for low level players to circlejerk in about how this game is trash and everyone is toxic and how soloq is all luck these are the only actual discussions that go on in this sub and they arent even discussions because any comments differing from the hivemind usually just end up getting buried with downvotes and disregarded the entire front page of this subreddit is loweffort and the mods here are legitimately some of the worst mods ive seen in any subreddit even the league sub is better than the fiesta that this has turned into but i mean its honestly fun to go through these threads and read some of the comments here
Overwatch,not_removed,ow was designed with teamwork as the focal point of the game but there is no system in place to enable teamwork other than just talk it out while individuals strongly benefit from not budging and making everyone else suck their dick instead
Overwatch,not_removed,everyone wants to carry a team with dps thats just the nature of this game because it takes a certain type of maturity to understand there are less glorious roles to be filled
Overwatch,not_removed,if youre going to join a basketball league just to shoot and hog the ball youre the asshole not the other people who also paid to be in the league on the court who are frustrated with your habits if you want to shoot by yourself dont disrupt a league competitive and go play on an open court somewhere arcade or quick play its almost like blizzard made different modes on purpose to allow everyone to play how they want and to play with other people of a similar mindset
Overwatch,not_removed,maybe he just likes chilling with torb so he can go chill with torbjörn to quickplay competitive is not the place for netflix and chill sorry
Overwatch,not_removed,people can play the game however the fuck they want they paid bucks for this game just like you no fucking shit this isnt a conversation about what is legally allowed its a conversation about not being a fucking asshole to your teammates by forcing them to work around your arrogant ass by your own logic youd be totally fine with having a mei in all your games blocking you off whenever possible because they paid bucks
Overwatch,not_removed,i also changed recently from an instalock tracer to a versatile flex that mostly instalock tracer didnt make a difference at all
Overwatch,not_removed,you arent wrong
Overwatch,not_removed,its almost like there are other people who paid for a game that are being punished
Overwatch,not_removed,he is decent on d but this person was playing torbjorn on attack as well
Overwatch,not_removed,them hey zen can we get a mercy me sure you can play whatever you like i hate when noone else is willing to play support and they tell me to pick a specific support i have of my hours played this season as a support character and find it laughable when people that never play support tell me to switch whichever support im playing
Overwatch,not_removed,yeah i played an attack symmetra in a koth game the other night and got a ton of hatemail after the game we already had a mercy and i really wanted to play symmetra i finished the game with gold kills and more importantly gold obj kills but it was my fault we lost sometimes i am just in the mood to play a character that is perhaps not in others definition of the meta because im nearly always the one to play heals my top played in competitive are the support characters for a total of hours and i didnt want to heal for once so maybe look at someone career profile before chastising them for picking something you think is outside the meta
Overwatch,not_removed,yeah this is me i mostly play dva zarya zen lucio and people bitch at me about the third tank its like nope guys ill do better with the third tank then you would get out of me as dps
Overwatch,not_removed,because is not always the right thing to do you can do triple tank double healer dps some dive comps are using only winston healers and dps and the often tank dps single healer with how important hero switching is i do not think that is a good idea
Overwatch,not_removed,couldnt have said it better myself
Overwatch,not_removed,ive actually been having good success with junkrat in spot situations on console recently if we have say tanks dps healer with enough sustain throughout i will go junk great for breaking shields getting random picks of the squishes hiding behind covershields and usually an easy double kill or more with the tire if you can get in a good enough position kings row has been my favorite to play him on attack lot of ways to really muck up the enemies defenses
Overwatch,not_removed,yup torb on a koth map such as ilios who cant even get a turret set up before he is killed or ran off his position should continue playing torb its going to eventually work and we will all applaud him for his perseverance instead of wishing he would have switched heroes earlier but he only plays torb so let him do his thing even if that means we get right
Overwatch,not_removed,these are extreme cases and obviously not what this post is about
Overwatch,not_removed,soldier is a good pick in almost all situations though
Overwatch,not_removed,hey dickhead theres a mode called quickplay play your shit torb there for real you are the kind of player that causes the actual cancerous tilting players to go full tilt and ruin a game have fun in quickplay hence the quickplay
Overwatch,not_removed,fuckin same ive only been asked to switch off mercy once and it was purely so another guy could play mercy everybody wants mercy on their team
Overwatch,not_removed,at of this subs sr it is not about playing strictly the meta it is about picking to counter the other team
Overwatch,not_removed,this was in the game but blizz removed it
Overwatch,not_removed,as long as youre winning man no hate just make sure youre winning lol
Overwatch,not_removed,what if you arent the reason youve climbed to diamond but youve been lucky enough to have teammates win with you on their back correlation isnt causation what if i can kill a pharah and mercy in shots as mccree and roll through the rest of the enemies as well but i cant because you and some other subpar dps refuse to switch so i have to tank or heal have you ever considered that maybe theres players with better game sense than you better reactions than you better aim than you have you ever considered you might be a gm if you worked with your team and played a tank or heal but i guess youd rather be complicit with your climb to diamond
Overwatch,not_removed,i personally disagree one youre restricting a lot of heroes for no good reason there are a lot of players that do instalock heroes yes but its relatively spread out across heroes ive definitely seen players instalock zenyatta or mercy from time to time two by restricting the heroes players can use it makes other heroes more powerful for example tracer is a lot stronger when theres no need to worry about junkrat traps zenyatta is a lot stronger when theres no need to worry about snipers and reinhardt is a lot stronger when theres no need to worry about junkrat or bastion three its unfair to those players they have as good a reason to be allowed to play those heroes as anyone else and four it makes it a lot harder for those players to climb if someone is very good on mei for example taking out flankers and denyingcontesting the objective to a point where mei is their strongest hero its a lot harder for them to get to a higher rank if they cant play as mei im not trying to sound rude by the way sorry if i came across as such but personally though i think hero bans are a terrible idea myself especially for a game like overwatch
Overwatch,not_removed,genji hanzo and widow main are the problem according to this sub honestly theyre not theyre just harder to be successfull with which is generally why people assume bad players a good genji hanzo or widow is absolutely devastating to go against
Overwatch,not_removed,pay for my game because i paid for it and yet i have to play with you throwing a match because you refuse to change
Overwatch,not_removed,so curious what happens when that one hero you can play gets picked and they wont switch off in my mind you should be at least familiar with a hero in each class
Overwatch,not_removed,people who try and tell you what to play in qp got problems
Overwatch,not_removed,yesterday this guy just refused to leave hanzo when we needed a reinhardt we lost that skirmish so hard
Overwatch,not_removed,i just hanzo in quickplay because in comp i main supports so i need a bit of fun in my life
Overwatch,not_removed,i was trying to practice ana in quick play and before beginning i stated bare with me guys im just trying to practice some ana and a teammate started bitching at me to change and that i was barely doing anything
Overwatch,not_removed,just tell them you specifically came to qp to practice and if they dont like that they should go to comp like keeping the two distinct is good for both metas
Overwatch,not_removed,yes u have to understand that to some people qp is just as serious as comp is to others because thats all they play for whatever reason to them you refusing to switch off reaper is like someone refusing to switch off offensive torb in comp with the argument where else am i going to practice torb in a serious environment just the way games with multiple play modes work
Overwatch,not_removed,is reaper considered underpowered
Overwatch,not_removed,good luck practicing reaper in your dps comp im sure that will help you in ranked
Overwatch,not_removed,oddly enough you see the most one tricks in grand master and master i am an unfortunate victim of the one trick i know it was my choice to focus on one hero granted no one complains about having a lucio on your team yet now when i want to learn a new hero to play in comp i never can i try learn them in quick play and besides the feeling of going super slow without speed boost i will rarely get to play against gm players that can further improve my skills to play another hero in comp as a result if i try play any other hero in comp its basically throwing the match granted unlike the player who refuses to switch i explain my situation and say politely if you really want another hero i will try but im sorry i wont be that good on them most of the time people enjoy having a lucio one trick on their team and you rarely run into issues where you should or have to swap granted i had one game where another player was a lucio main so now i have him added and we dont queue at the same time it does help there are only lucio mains int he top oce and i think another in gm
Overwatch,not_removed,although if youre gonna learn a hero you cant do that without heals and tanks i find it funny however that the people saying this stuff you need to swap are always dps players also if youre gonna practice a hero i recommend going into custom game and create a game fitting for the thing you want to learn for example if its genji ult you want to practice create a game vs bots make yourself rly op in terms of survivability and up your ult charge to while you keep the opponents relatively the same except when it comes to damaging you which you reduce then slice and dice untill you get tired i bet you can make something work which will help with reaper
Overwatch,not_removed,qp is weird if i tell my team im practicing a particular hero i get told its qp lol nobody cares if i dont say a thing sooner or later some tilted asshole goes hey musicackbar your shit go uninstall
Overwatch,not_removed,the problem is that your qp mmr is what dictates your comp placement so when you lose of your games in qp because people pick shit comps it makes the comp grind that much harder now i think thats a bullshit system and i dont fault anyone for playing what they want to play in qp ive won more games with dps than with dps heal tank but i see where people are coming from when someone is basically throwing the game and always responding with its qp fuck off i think it matters how its handled by all parties can you please swap im practicing this character so id prefer not to ok that is the conversation ive seen plenty of times and its the right way to handle it all around the toxicity and inability to see the other persons perspective thats the biggest issue in this game
Overwatch,not_removed,honestly the first thing that i do for a new hero is go into the training grounds i try to get a feel for the overall mechanics of a character for example with orisa i sat in there getting an idea of the speed on her projectilebased main attack to see how far id need to lead at certain distances ultimately these are the things that you dont need to be in a game to do now this obviously wont train you for how to behave in an actual match one thing i try to do there is watch other players to see how they play a hero and how well it all works after that ill usually try them out but i try to keep in mind that im not a team of one my practice shouldnt ruin the game for other players and if i feel like im just not helping ill swap after a bit an example could be after a koth round or maybe minutes into capture point i still get practice and i can help my team winwin getting to play new heroes is also one reason why i play the random heroes mode in arcade its an excuse to play a hero that i may not be great at p
Overwatch,not_removed,i dunno my friend climbed to masters playing only ana in comp and it seems like a lot of tank or support mains get away with only having a hero pool of maybe or characters my friends reasoning on just playing one character is that hes got a job and he doesnt have time to be good at tons of characters he just has time to be really good at one and it turns out the one he picked works in practically every comp if youre only at your rank because youre good at one character switching off seems like a good thing but probably actually hurts your teams chances anyway seems like a lot to be good at if youre a good rein no one is ever gonna ask you to switch same as lucio or ana youre only screwed if you land in a game where you have or rein mains
Overwatch,not_removed,i think this is one thing we need more of in the community yea if we have people automatically lock into dps and no one is willing to switch i fucking hate losing we obviously could have done better if our team wasnt full of cunts but if everyone is doing their best and the other team is better why would i be mad raging out only discourages the rest of the team and effects future games
Overwatch,not_removed,sadly that rarely happens but games like that are really enjoyable instead people pick what they feel like playing instead of trying to work as a team i always tell my team i prefer you play what youre good at or pick what youre comfortable with and i usually fill in the roll and try to compliment based on my skill set
Overwatch,not_removed,if can get other semiflexible proficient on heroes tryhards who are communicating and is just generally willing to work with me as i them on my team every game i would be happy to lose every game thats what you think right now
Overwatch,not_removed,i started playing comp with my friends since solo q below diamond is such a cesspool and you only win out of luck and its a lot more fun and we actually rank up were not ranking up because were communicating to the max and on point no we rank up because were not toxic to each other theres no throwers no leavers and we having fucking fun thats what a game should be fun i wouldve won so many solo q games if my team stopped getting mad at each other over stupid shit my six stackfive stack just fucks around and has fun for hours doing the most stupid comp to see if we win i would rather lose over and over with my friends and we enjoy ourselves rather than win with a bunch of bitching shitty toxic manchildren
Overwatch,not_removed,its actually been proven that anything higher than stack makes climbing harder the matchmaking will balance by putting you against stronger opponents you will also loose more sr on losses and gain less on wins thats not taking into account the fact that if you go against another team you not only need to be better skillwise but you need an incredebly high level of coordination unless you are leagues above the enemy in skill
Overwatch,not_removed,you parrot this myth a lot is more difficult than soloqueue because theres a very big chance youll be matched with a stack of friends who communicate better than your stack does and if youre trying to imply you cant blame other people because youre in a stack id like to promptly shut that down as well sure you can
Overwatch,not_removed,thats an annoying mentality why do you have to blame someone if you lose just admit you did bad as a team and lost or if one of your friends did particularly bad just let them know what they did wrong if they cant take the criticism boot him if you did bad own up to it when i do bad i know im doing bad if someone calls me out ill agree why because its easier to improve if you know what you did wrong
Overwatch,not_removed,thats why people dont like to thats the only way i play anymore because the game cannot place you where you belong playing solo and saying that it can is total bullshit playing solo for two seasons straight i could not climb out of gold and was steadily falling below that started playing with a six stack and we shot right out of gold into diamond in no time were still on the climb up too just having a hard time finding time when were all on and sure enough soon as some try to solo their ranks start falling because widow mains torb mains leavers trolls uncoordinated fuckwits that couldnt find a payload if you gave them a map and anything else you can think of six stacks remove all that both blue and red team because nobody wants to group up with people like that stack vs stack is a totally different game and a much much better one
Overwatch,not_removed,well it kinda is your stack better be gud because your competition is gunna be harder than solo queue also for me its not about ranking up i just wanna have a fun game if we are all trying and we get destroyed ill laugh it off clearly they were just so much better than us what are you gunna do its just annoying when the game is clearly winnable but someone is being an ass and we lose even if its really competitive and down to the wire its annoying to think we are being held back
Overwatch,not_removed,stack is more difficult — it guarantees you are playing against a team of people that will be communicating and have played together before chances are they will be better than a group of randoms who have never played together and people might not get their best role
Overwatch,not_removed,it isnt that much more difficult but you get less sr if you win
Overwatch,not_removed,the scape goat i use to say in voice comm is that they played better than all of us combined
Overwatch,not_removed,i dont because all my friends play on console and i play on pc feelsbadman
Overwatch,not_removed,im a one trick pony i belong exactly where i am sr wise if i ever make it to gold i will deserve to be there no matter what my sr is it is right at that moment i play to win but play the character i want because i know im going to be the most effective with it at the time he is the only char that feels fun to me i was recently told i threw the round by an enemy because i tried a different class and was much less effective ive hit mastergm the past two seasons solo queue is the easiest way to climb for me
Overwatch,not_removed,ive worked with my team and weve won ive encouraged them despite us having a hanzo widow torb and weve won a large part of the match is morale and confidence
Overwatch,not_removed,lol how many games are you playing where all of your teammates are not trying to win or theyre all way worse than that other team you got matched with
Overwatch,not_removed,this looks like it has a hint of truth because it is written well but mainly this just sounds like a douchebag trying to justify himself i agree with this point its obviously written by someone who doesnt care about his team in any way shape or form and is just trying to justify himself online competitive gaming has social contracts that start as soon as you join the game even if theyre unwritten i disagree with this completely joining a competitive game does not opt you into a social contract to bend your gameplay and play style to your teammates or the meta the only social contract that i feel youre entering is the agreement to do the best you can to win lets say someone is an asshole widow that refuses to switch if they are a great widow and can get kills and advance the team then they shouldnt have to switch to fit the way your team wants to play or to fit the meta if you recognize your team has a great widow maybe you should choose to change your own style to support that widow or play something to counter widows counters for all you know that player may be garbage at everyone else but is a godlike sniper now im not saying that everyone who instalocks widow is in the right if theyre a bad widow they should switch to something that they will perform better at and help the team teamcomp is a huge deal but it should be built around supporting your best team members and highlighting individual players strengths if youre telling someone to switch just because you dont have dps tank heals then youre the one being toxic
Overwatch,not_removed,that post actually makes me angry it completely ignores the fact that this is a team game and the fucker who is not working as a team is a detriment
Overwatch,not_removed,my favorite is we need a rein can you go rein even though we have a mercy lucio pharah winston and tracer or genji like what is my shield supposed to do protect the payload from getting damaged
Overwatch,not_removed,i hate this sit there watching the kill feed and reins oblivious that hes just shielding himself spamming i need healing like wut
Overwatch,not_removed,i only play lucio and no one has ever complained cheers to us
Overwatch,not_removed,ive basically only played zenyatta this season every once in a while i hear hey zen can you switch to mercyanalucio no im better with zen oh okay then
Overwatch,not_removed,thats essentially how i defaulted to being a rein mainno one ever asked me to switch
Overwatch,not_removed,thats not a good thing when blizzards goal was to make every hero applicable it forces the community into a specific playstyle rather than encouraging creative and innovative play styles i understand that they have been trying to nerf these characters but they need to do more to make the current comp less strict on just rein ana lucio zarya roadhog and soldier theres characters only having that are viable out of those is boring
Overwatch,not_removed,torbjorn is a lot less niche right now than you might think hes really good at hybrid maps point maybe not on numbani as much and hes very capable of holding down a location and he pairs up nicely with shield champs because of the way armor functions being a onetrick in this game is less than optimal but if you look to work around an ally you can find that what they lack in diversity they usually make up for practice and skill in one particular hero nobody likes playing with an attack torb but ive won a lot of games with it and ill be the last person to complain about him not switching though i may ask him nicely if hes willing to change then leave it at that if they dont
Overwatch,not_removed,tell me about it lost two matches because we had miraculously three main healers in the team and when i say main i say i cant play dps or tank of course we tried to keep one as dps or tank one time was me other times was another guy and well not even the best dps of the game in moment can make someone like me good at dpsing i said sorry dozen of times during this match
Overwatch,not_removed,widow is fine junkrat is in a bad spot torb could use a faster turret build animation
Overwatch,not_removed,i agree with this whenever someone makes a questionable pick rather than saying dude switch off and go i just ask hey wanna switch who are you good at if you word it like that theyre usually more receptive to switching and if theyre not good with certain heroes sometimes other team members will jump in and do a swap its rare but when it happens its really nice
Overwatch,not_removed,still find it weird that people think lucio is the most boring hero that concept is impossible for me to comprehend
Overwatch,not_removed,and you can go do that in quick play comp is for people that actually want to cooperate if you dont want to cooperate why are you playing a highly cooperative mode
Overwatch,not_removed,fucking this i rarely if ever see anyone ask nicely when ive asked people to switch i honestly try to be as nice as possiblecould someone please go x if not its cool i just think it would be helpful and even then i still feel like an asshole for asking lol
Overwatch,not_removed,potential joke aside i cant count the number of games weve lost because our junkratreapersym refused to switch to help out with the pharah decimating our team
Overwatch,not_removed,flexible being flexible would easily help some plat players get into diamond i remember times where i would sabotage myself by contributing to bad comps then i started playing with a team mentality making active switches to counter the enemy in the middle of rounds etc got into diamond and still climbing id say if you do this alone longterm you can boost you winning percentage by a significant amount
Overwatch,not_removed,only sweat the stuff you can control once you take the mindset that their pick is out of your control and you just need to figure out what the best personal pick for the current team composition you will win more its not fair but it is the mindset you need to get into in order to win more games
Overwatch,not_removed,because one player decided to be closeminded in their hero selection is that actually the reason you lost though do you genuinely believe that you would have crushed the enemy team if he had switched to a hero hes not good at
Overwatch,not_removed,no your attitude is wrong imo i can tell from your story you already complained about him when he was on defence youd have had to have done to know he was very adamant about it for him to be that the team must have pushed very hard so you already pissed him off pissing him off likely tilted the team so by attack he already didnt care because of what hed put up with at this point even if he had been a person willing to swap like i am he wouldnt have done like i wouldnt because of the prior attitudes if people are going to swap theyll swap they dont need people their own rank pretending they know more about the game and how that person plays than that person does
Overwatch,not_removed,im going to blow your mind and drill home a point because it applied to league of legends as well and it applies here or to just about any competitive game you are a good teammate you are willing to swap and play what the team needs youre not going to only play dps when you need a support or a tank right you are the constant in this situation you take up one space on a team of therefore the enemy has chances of toxic assholes and you only have you have the winning odds here everyone has to deal with one trick ponies toxic kids stubborn people deal with it adapt to the situation and if its not a winnable game and you lose move on take a break if you have to and realize youre not going to win of your games look at your own faults so shut up and dont shitpost and realize that the closeminded one is you one day this subreddit might finally be done with people complaining about my team sucks im good and they wont listen etc etc
Overwatch,not_removed,its just frustrating to lose so much sr simply because one player decided to be closeminded in their hero selection you will not improve if you keep blaming losses on your team mates picks a single offmeta pick really doesnt impact your team that much if its a otp its not likely to negatively impact your team at all you will not recognize the areas you can improve on if you blame your team
Overwatch,not_removed,here comes the fun part where every single one of us is struggling why is he on the same mmr bracket as you he wasnt playing as good as you but since you both lost your mmr is close enough to be paired up again if you are lucky he ends up on the enemy team in games he will be silver you plat until then he will pull down many people with him
Overwatch,not_removed,heres my take as a semione trick i know when im being effective i know when im being countered because ive put an absurd amount of time into this hero i know for a fact i am not whats bringing the team down and some jerkwad wants me to change because im not playing on the absolute max meta level fuck you you dont know what im doing you dont have any idea whether or not im being effective because you cant see what i see you havent put in the time that i have to make myself better at my hero you dont understand him like i do so how about instead of tilting your own teammates lets identify the real problems trickling focus fire communication positioning ult usage which enemy is shutting down our team how do we reduce their effectiveness these are the questions you ask not who do i blame for us not roflstomping the enemy team you tell me switch off its not working ill tell you to go fuck yourself you tell me we need to counter the pharah please switch to hitscan or we need to counter the symmetra please switch to pharah or winston or dva then i can understand why you want me to switch and am more willing to oblige dont tell me i cant play my hero i know when im being effective better than you do identify real problems so we can actually solve them and not just reach around in the dark acting like playing on the meta is an auto victory
Overwatch,not_removed,partly because these days if you main mage supports and you already have two mages in either topmidjungle you really need a tank winning lane in league of legends means little to nothing these days the days of season are over where winning lane winning game you need to reliably win teamfights with as few of your team dying as possible to win being able to do that relies on having the best team fighting composition having mages on your team basically means any group ult or lack of reliable initiation will lead to a team wipe imagine this your team has a rumble top and a syndra mid their team is already going to be building shitloads of magic resist picking another mage support basically means that you will do no damage while providing marginally less cc and wont be able to soak up as many abilities as a tank support could
Overwatch,not_removed,exactly if im getting wrecked by a tracer and winston because my team isnt fighting then well its not like i can switch of ana that would just make it worse
Overwatch,not_removed,like weve a winston annihilating our healers constantly could one of the dps go reaper no no one willing to take the hero that will easily counter the hero that is wrecking us i dont care how good a junkrat and genji our dps obsessives are we need a reaper why do you need a reaper to counter winston when you have a junkrat also you could have a tank go roadhog
Overwatch,not_removed,this is exactly why lucio needed a rework
Overwatch,not_removed,i dont get it there are like hundreds of single player games and even multiplayer games where teamwork is irrelevant and you can do whatever you want why would you choose to spend to bring other people down in a clearly teamwork oriented game
Overwatch,not_removed,youd rather have a terrible support than a decent tracergenji sorry but its le team game is only used by people who surprise surprise also dont want to switch in order to pressure people into picking whatever hero is meta this week
Overwatch,not_removed,competitive exists to win not to have fun well for most its both fun and win if you are not having fun why even play a video game
Overwatch,not_removed,to be fair sym speed boost wrecks a lot of teams
Overwatch,not_removed,exactly people will blame the master rank torb with gold medals before they even think about blaming the who is is contributing less than the troll
Overwatch,not_removed,i love jumping around since torb jumps relatively high
Overwatch,not_removed,as a gm player just because you have a higher rank doesnt mean your understanding of what in the game is fun is any better than mine the fact that youre recommending jumpspamming already by default tells me that yes the majority of loses you have can and are attributed to very very poor reasoning and decision making i just like jumping torb is tiny so his jumps are really huge also i can look at butts thats basically why i main him — i play for fun mostly winning is fun doing whatever we can to win is fun nope being a ft ikea gnome and jumping around is fun
Overwatch,not_removed,not once did you give a reason that torbjorn is not optimal hes dmg is as good as reaper has shields he can make really fucking quick has an aimbot turret at his disposal every seconds is harder to hit has a good enough long range dmg that is as good as zenyattas and his ult is one of the best in the game he is more optimal than half the dps any of the defense heroes symmetra and winston
Overwatch,not_removed,what everyone already knows uh so are you agreeing that this subreddit is ridiculous or what
Overwatch,not_removed,isnt he only head because his body is smaller thats not really a downside
Overwatch,not_removed,yeah you should be moving it after every team fight at minimum
Overwatch,not_removed,glad you can do no wrong but this clearly was not the case in my game
Overwatch,not_removed,this efforts were made to make the sub have more meaningful discussion but it was hard fought against because people wanted easy to digest content read shitposting
Overwatch,not_removed,six stack is difficult but you will be learning at a faster rate
Overwatch,not_removed,thats up for the player to decide the people that play to lose are not the same as the people that play an off meta pick to win playing an off meta hero is not trolling or not playing serious
Overwatch,not_removed,i dont even play this game and you cant stop me
Overwatch,not_removed,meh i had a team criticize my attack sym on kings row the other day i told them to give it a chance it would work we capped the first point in a minute because i flanked out the story window and microwaved their support and dps then the team rushed past the choke for an easy cap we ended up winning the game easily and that sequence was potm the stack invited me to join them right after the match
Overwatch,not_removed,its the worst i do the same thing i dont exactly like supporting but i do it because i want to win sadly once people hit diamond they give up and think thats as far as they can climb so they stop trying and just troll
Overwatch,not_removed,sorry no you dont have to call me dickhead as i said il play the game for fun in competitive that doesnt mean il troll but torb is a hero in this game so it should be able for players to play him right why is there to be played like every other heroes dickhead
Overwatch,not_removed,no it was that you could avoid it for and against the problem was that good players were having problems finding games if they make it team specific and enough players dont want to play with you than you should be the one suffering i dont have problems with instalocking hanzo junkrat or whatever the thing is you have to know when to change
Overwatch,not_removed,so then everyone who climbs in rank is lucky because they get good teammates and everyone who drops rank is unlucky that is some of the most backwards ass victimcomplex logic i have ever heard no
Overwatch,not_removed,anyone willing to put of hours into a hero should be devastating to go against and usually worth trying to work with instead of against it sucks when they dont talk as full disclosure in the beginning seems to help the teams willingness but not worth throwing the game over see what they can do
Overwatch,not_removed,i play who i want xoxo
Overwatch,not_removed,thats when you start to hold their mmr hostage like some elo terrorist and threaten to throw if they dont switch
Overwatch,not_removed,i play lucio because its basically the easiest hero to play im familiar with each hero but not enough to point where i can play them all on grandmaster level im a good ana but according to this post since im only that good on ana i shouldnt be playing competitive
Overwatch,not_removed,really were only going to go with one tank our mccree last night in qp
Overwatch,not_removed,seriously i always just say you need to reevaluate your life after getting this upset over quickplay
Overwatch,not_removed,the other day a dude on my team started getting trashtalked by another teammate because he shouldnt play soldier if he sucks ass at it someone on the other team told him to not pick on him because it was quickplay and people were free to play whatever the hell they wanted because the mode was for fun his response no you gotta play qp in the same way as ranked because qp is where you prepare for ranked mode and if you wanna learn new heroes theres practice range and arcade
Overwatch,not_removed,tell me about it i played qp last week and i was practicing with sombra and this other guy was practicing with widowmaker the rest of our team was a fourman party who complained and then just left worked out for us since we ended up winning with our new teammates who didnt care that we were practicing
Overwatch,not_removed,dear god my friend always try to get a in qp i always tell him its for fun and fucking around but he never gets it
Overwatch,not_removed,same thing in arcade since it doesnt really matter im usually more than willing to try some high risk moves in ctf that i would never try in comp then when it fails i get flamed lmfor throwing called a scrub etc i dunno ctf isnt serious business to me its not like i throwdont okay well it just allows me to play more aggressively
Overwatch,not_removed,even worse when people tell you what to not play in no limits you cant limit me in no limitssings firefly theme
Overwatch,not_removed,no quickplay has become aids because people have started playing team comps with no tanks healers ect
Overwatch,not_removed,exactly i let loose in quickplay because im a zen main i figure i deserve a lil fun in the game my homie and i had a great night of no limits and it reminded me why i loved the game so much
Overwatch,not_removed,hopefully thats an isolated incident i also have issues practicing ana in qp but now my go to is hey guys i want to practice ana does anyone feel like practicing tank i will pocket the shit out of you thats actually worked for me a number of times
Overwatch,not_removed,come to australian servers we dont even take comp serious the entire thing in high ranks is a bunch of people who play with and against each other having a laugh and just joking around
Overwatch,not_removed,at higher ranks he is platinum on down hes alright
Overwatch,not_removed,the thing for me is every hero in the game can get countered as it should be if the enemy team has switched heroes specifically to counter you and youre no longer really contributing cause you keep getting shut down hard then you should switch to a different hero regardless of whether youre trying to practice or not its just part of the game
Overwatch,not_removed,against the wrong team yes against a team of winstons hes a god
Overwatch,not_removed,considered yes is he no way his guns melt i main reaps and have worked my way to diamond closing in on master a good pharah is your biggest problem but if your other dps is soldier youre good to go his main issue is that you have to be close which you get punished for in this game but its cool thats what you have wraith for the spin to win button is also one of the best ults in the game imo
Overwatch,not_removed,its just that i wasnt very good with him i still got two golds though
Overwatch,not_removed,sadly that rarely happens this happens to me all the time just be the first one to talk is really it and talk about your gameplan and obviously stay positive it really works
Overwatch,not_removed,i have a friend thats pretty flexible but was constantly saying everyone was moving too fast for him the last time we played competitive we had trouble making coordinated pushes as a result
Overwatch,not_removed,truth people can and will play the blame game on a six stack they just need the right trigger losing streak
Overwatch,not_removed,tbh i dont need someone to tell me im doing bad because im already aware and complaining about it will just make me play worse if you really want me to change up something say what i should try doing instead of just saying that what im currently doing trash
Overwatch,not_removed,well what if the primary reason we did bad as a team was because of a bad hero composition im not going to say that the torb is bad or the widow or hanzo is bad but the pick they made yeah that was a mistake and thats not all the time im ok if youre doing something as these heros but when youre not up to snuff it might just be the pick not the skill
Overwatch,not_removed,depends i solo qued to high masters as a winston main seen it happen to others as well
Overwatch,not_removed,youre half right it removes the randomness but the randomness balances itself out for every game you play with a troll there is another game you won because the other team had one for every offensive torb you get that costs you a game you play against one in another game solo queue is all about consistent play from yourself and your ability to coordinate with a random assortment of people its a different skill than playing as a you have to be good at coordinating in a short timeframe and be able to flex to different heroesroles to make your team better playing in a full group focuses more on timing and tight coordination and less on getting everyone to work together or having the ability to flex roles if you couldnt get out of gold solo then its likely youre just better at coordinating with the people you know and filling a specific role than you are working with randoms and playing different stuff its also possible based off your initial comment that you tilt easily and are actually just playing bad in matches after you lose due to a perceived bad player or troll on your team this might cause you to lose games you otherwise would have won due to your own performance and stagnated your climb solo queue will place you where you belong as an individual in this team game after enough games played as long as you play at a consistent level
Overwatch,not_removed,how did you find that six stack ive made a couple attempts at grouping but it always ends up being people who clam up the instant the match begins and it turns right back into solo queue
Overwatch,not_removed,wait really is that seriously a thing
Overwatch,not_removed,this is where i get the most confused one of the highlights of ow is its rockpaperscissors style of gameplay team composition is fluid even outside of the frustration i just dont understand why someone would play a competitive mode in a game like this if they didnt want to participate in that kind of gameplay
Overwatch,not_removed,thats all fine and dandy till you get someone else who only plays lucio and one of you has to go dps forced me to actually learn to play dps at a masters level on an alt since my dps game was garbage tier
Overwatch,not_removed,and thats bad sometimes a zen is not the pick especially if the enemy has strong flankers nothing is more tilting than one trick zens who refuse to go lucio on koth after repeatedly getting their faces melted off by the enemy tracer directly out of spawn
Overwatch,not_removed,im not saying its a good thing its just how things are
Overwatch,not_removed,not every hero should be equally viable on every map i think having niche heroes is fun and the amount of work my defense torb does on point defense does not mean i will be playing him on attack or koth or payload i have an win rate with him because i only use him when hes viable what gets me is people who get rolled and refuse to switch like are winston going are gains a team with a reaper bastion roadhog and diva i dont care if you can mess up there healers your pretty much worthless against the rest of the team
Overwatch,not_removed,different kinds of comps use different kinds of heroes some are more viable at higher levels of play but it doesnt mean that theres only where you are you just need to not pick silly you can easily swap out soldier for mccree if youre good with him or a hog for an orisa it wont break your comp you just need to realise when its worth doing and when its not
Overwatch,not_removed,tbf way more than are viable right now you want to run dive have at it tracer genji pharah monkey lucio and zen then tank is another option for you where you have rein zar ana and hog all swapped in were already at almost half the cast from just a couple of possible comps both of which are seeing pro use right now then you can run torbsym as situational defence picks mercy with the pharah on some maps dva is useful in a niche way as is mei and mccree sees a fair amount of use in the pros thats all off the top of my head from watching recent tournaments i dont know how these more niche picks translate to top of the ladder tbf not being good enough to get there
Overwatch,not_removed,hes really good at hybrid maps point hence the term niche
Overwatch,not_removed,maybe not on numbani as much hes actually played on numbani in pro play cause thats a map where the enemy is likely to pick divers because they have vertical mobility and torb is good against themthough when the attackers pick pharah the torbs not as good
Overwatch,not_removed,im kind of thinking if you wind up in a situation like that again why not let the main healers play healer the main tanks play tank and the main dps play dps i guess it would wind up with a onesided team but im thinking if everyone is good enough with the heroes theyre playing as then it shouldnt be too hard to win if everyone performs their function victory is assured i havent tried it myself to be fair although i wouldnt argue with someone with hours on zenyatta playing as zenyatta for instance im wondering if selecting your best heroes regardless of meta perhaps even comp would be the most successful strategy
Overwatch,not_removed,i agree that widow isnt necessarily underpowered i mean that their kits are the least rounded of any heroes theyre too situational the kits themselves need some balancing then people wouldnt get as upset at attack torb or koth widowmaker
Overwatch,not_removed,i think what ugngeorgiev is saying is that theyre willing to cooperate and pick heroes to help their team but not heroes they dont want to play as while it is quite an open statement it could be anything from i dont want to play as dva to i dont want to play as healer i can understand where theyre coming from i dont really want to play ana in competitive even if my team wants to thats not that i dont want to cooperate but im not confident in my ability on ana so im worried about holding my team back by playing as ana doing more harm than good if i need to play as a healer i feel much more confident on lucio mostly from a perspective of staying alive contesting the point and healing my teammates nearby
Overwatch,not_removed,well if you have a team of squishy dps and your playing lucio yes you absolutely would have better performance by actually having a tank to help mitigate damage its amazing how useful a shitty rein can be for getting through a chokepoint sometimes and healers are really useful too if people are trying to play as a team if everyone is trying to carry then possibly no
Overwatch,not_removed,i love how he sees no irony in his complaints about being closeminded to peoples hero selection
Overwatch,not_removed,is that actually the reason you lost though are you seriously trying to argue its impossible to lose because of an uncooperative teammate because it happens all the damn time team a has people all working as a team and building a team comp that works together team b has people working as a team and building a team comp that works together and then guy who does whatever he wants which team do you think is going to have the advantage do you genuinely believe that you would have crushed the enemy team if he had switched to a hero hes not good at if he is not good at any other heroes then he needs to get out of comp and go practice in qp
Overwatch,not_removed,ill upvote you fuck people who jump on the blame train even if it was someone elses fault if all you do is blame others then you arent looking at your own faults and a loss doesnt mean you didntcant improve for future games
Overwatch,not_removed,i dont understand your line of thinking here this is a strawman and a fucking crazy one at that its always a feelbad when you lose a team game and you think you played well i doubt that op is the type to never admit that he was beat or the kind of guy who always blames his team when youre on reddit and not coming off a loss you felt you didnt deserve its very easy to just be like quit being a bitch however i think weve all been where op was before and we all need to vent sometimes
Overwatch,not_removed,you ever been to a casino you ever watch someone play roulette and just bet redblack and win money the odds of losing money betting on redblack are pretty much the same as the change you have of winning based on poor luck of the draw for a terrible teammate now youre right that eventually it evens out just like the house always wins but the crux here is the sample size and even over the course of a whole damn season the number of games for most players doesnt get that high theres simply not enough samples for the odds to kick in that much when its that close to statistically theres probably a very large percentage of people who have been screwed more than theyve been helped by people costing their team a game and those people are the vocal ones so sure tell anyone with games a season theyre the problem but people with theres a good chance theyre getting hit with some shitty luck and have a pretty legit grievance
Overwatch,not_removed,this advice only works with a massive sample size
Overwatch,not_removed,preach spent years dealing with the same shitposts on the league subreddit and eventually people realized this is exactly true took a fair few unraked to diamondchallengers streams to convince most people its not overly complicated if you are significantly better than the people you are playing with and against you will carry and climb if you arent youll stay at that level or fall until you improve play to improve your own game and skill not to win you cant win every game tis impossible
Overwatch,not_removed,i tryndamere top in diamond several seasons i ignore teammates and split push while they rage at me to show presence in team fights win rate is like i cause for lots of toxicity but i dont care i wont conform to meta ill play my game and win
Overwatch,not_removed,its a team based game youre supposed to work as a team if one member of the team is refusing to work with the others the whole team suffers a useless torb takes up space and not to mention it emotionallypsychologically affects your gameplay a single offmeta pick very much impacts the team having the mentality that you cant blame the team in a team based game when theyre not cooperating doesnt make sense to me
Overwatch,not_removed,youre mistaken in assuming they are on their way down a torb otp might lack pick strategy and counters but theyre probably making up for it in other ways if theyre in plat ive had torb sombra and junkrat otps on my team wreck shit in masters build your team around them instead of telling them to switch they wont anyway and theyll usually do well
Overwatch,not_removed,except this isnt true hes there because frankly the loss wasnt his fault the team threw the game because they had a torb torb is fine torb is viable there is nothing wrong with the pick dont believe everything you youtube
Overwatch,not_removed,or his higher mmr friend teamed up with him i find thats frequently the source of these things is a player being propped up by a party that count support him and going dps despite having very little mechanical skills or in the case or the torb autolock lack of sense for situationally appropriate character picks
Overwatch,not_removed,they could maybe get good at support or other heroes in general thats what i did and now i have at least one hero in every class that i can confidently play as needed
Overwatch,not_removed,ask the pro players of any game who constantly talk about how much they hate it
Overwatch,not_removed,i dont mean to be a dick but you know that makes you a super easy target
Overwatch,not_removed,i play for fun mostly then play quick play
Overwatch,not_removed,not in a negativ way for me roverwatch is more like to see fanmade content well playedfunny potg and this kind of content and now and then you see a guide for a hero or a real discussion you cant deny that this subreddit has mostly potgs and fan content but that isnt a bad everyone knows its like this but to come here and rant about is unnecessary imo
Overwatch,not_removed,im mostly just bantering it is lame the guy wasnt good at widow
Overwatch,not_removed,even better
Overwatch,not_removed,the person who paid for a movie ticket just like you also has the right to talk on his phone throughout the entire movie but its generally understood between grown adults that were not animals we live in a society and its a dick move to do that and its kind of expected that when you buy your ticket you understand and agree to that if you dont want to agree to that there are plenty of other leisure activities that are more accommodating to phone conversations maybe try a bowling alley no one cares if youre on your phone there
Overwatch,not_removed,it all depends on how you play the character attack torb can work im a huge fan of attack sym as long as the person knows how to play her but hell im always up for giving any character a chance nothing pisses me off more when the team gets toxic before the start of a match becasue someone picked sombra
Overwatch,not_removed,i would like something like this too but it may not fit very well and there will still be problems like longer q times would the dps not be allowed to swtich to a tank or a healer if they feel they are lacking and can do better in a different role eg we need a rein the current tanks we have are zarya dva both cannot do rein but can dps or heal dps healers and tanks need to triple swap to get the right comp even if all parties are willing to switch would swaps be allowed how it would work i thought about this for a minute and it already sounds like a bad idea to me
Overwatch,not_removed,the way you worded your original op is that you are trolling trolls in comp instant dickhead in my mind trolls also always say deal with it so if you are not trolling then do whatever you want and i apologize reminder though if you arent playing to win blizzard will have issue with it with their httpsgfycatcomcavernousspicygallinule so if youre having fun involves not completing the objective because you arent helping your team win you can and will get actioned on by blizzard by their words too so practicing my torb on attack in a comp game falls under poor teamwork by blizzard because you arent helping to win youre just practicing or having fun
Overwatch,not_removed,well i hope you dont get to mgm so i dont have to play with you luckily that that shouldnt be a problem just lol cant believe theres people that would rather lose then let better players than them play dps i guess if thats their version of fun
Overwatch,not_removed,no you said you play only one hero so you cant play anyone else so you dont play who you want you play them
Overwatch,not_removed,dont you just love when one of the or dps on your team complains about the comp saying that we need another healer or tank that really tilts me
Overwatch,not_removed,its easier to practice heroes with a decent team comp in qp so you can figure out how they work in a real comp
Overwatch,not_removed,mccree lol
Overwatch,not_removed,mute him block him dont say a thing to him disacknowledge his existence if he cant approach a subject like a fullygrown adult then he does not deserve any speaking privileges
Overwatch,not_removed,what i find amazing is that i might say something to this effect and they usually go off on a rant about how bad teammate x is no friend i dont care about that x could be the worst player in the world but you will still be the guy screaming at people over their hero choice in the casual mode of a video game and thats much worse they usually just go completely silent at that point
Overwatch,not_removed,i have just started leaving voice and muting team chat in qp its never worth being in either
Overwatch,not_removed,
Overwatch,not_removed,now go home and rethink your life
Overwatch,not_removed,you need to reevaluate your life after getting this upset over comp fixed
Overwatch,not_removed,to be fair if people treated qp as a training grounds for ranked it would be a better training experience for those that wanted to practice new heroes right now qp is such a joke that the most you can learn is basic controls the same that you could learn in practice or arcade people often say that qp is better to practice than nolimits because of the hero limit but you still have to go with no healer or no tank in qp so you cant learn to play around them either comp is the only place t truly practice new heroes not saying that everyone should take qp that seriously but it would be nice to have an unranked mode with comp rules teams based on sr and no sr changes after a match to learn new heroes or practice comp without gambling with your sr
Overwatch,not_removed,i only play meta heroes in the practice range
Overwatch,not_removed,you have to understand that some people play qp not to go right after in ranked but because they just want to play playing random stuff isnt really meta so some people will complain you cant really blame people choosing anything randomly to try it when theres no healers but you cant also blame the people wanting to play the way its meant to be played
Overwatch,not_removed,i played with that ranter recently only he was the phara getting uber ragey at the comp i was playing zen i got gold damage gold elims and gold objective time of us pointed this out to him so he rage quit
Overwatch,not_removed,why bother sending it to the person theyre still not going to agree with you and youre just prolonging an unpleasant interaction
Overwatch,not_removed,hes fine in diamond circumstantial but thats ok
Overwatch,not_removed,im not sure if i entirely agree with you on the switching when getting countered bit in competitive yes it definitely seems like the best idea however if you do play a hero or at least certain heroes effectively enough you can pretty much not be countered by a particular hero or at least a specific player will need to go a particular hero to counter this is extremely effective if done well ever had that really good that you couldnt take out no matter how hard your team tried thats the potential reward of getting good enough with a particular hero of course in competitive its a good idea to switch in quick playarcade staying on a hero to improve with them is not a bad idea the other extreme to being uncounterable is being unable to counter if youre not experienced enough on youll find it hard to take down pharah as for instance
Overwatch,not_removed,hes not even that good against winston hog does his job better
Overwatch,not_removed,this can not be said enough be friendly and positive and even the most toxic player have a good laugh and some fun like how do you think one tricks get so high up atm there is a player called junkrat playing only junkrat in gm and he is by far one of the funnest people to play with like make the game really enjoyable and everyone communicates and has fun
Overwatch,not_removed,lucky you haha i dont tilt anymore and try to keep positive vibes even if its obvious why we lost i just laugh it off focus on my gameplay and try to carry xd and for people not using their mics rip feels bad team haha ill call out for everyone xd
Overwatch,not_removed,me hey guys sees one other person in comms me can you join team chat one other person joins never says anything me there is a genji flanking on the left please help guys genji flanking im about to die crickets loss screen this is how of eu games go
Overwatch,not_removed,dont get me wrong i agree with you that they should give advice instead of just spamming kys trash but most people are pure salt and cant do anything else but that sometimes they get thrown off when you actually start agreeing with them though lol
Overwatch,not_removed,because you had a balanced team of the time people complain when they pick a niche hero x in a balanced team now where would they be if they always were in a team with niche heroes who would also never switch because one only plays as hanzo second one never switches from widow third one torbmain fourth only plays as sombra people have to understand there a all around heroes and there are specific heroes its so easy posting on reddit about i was flamed by picking x and i climbed to gm by picking y when they are an in fact an offhero inside a balanced team it works what wont work is a full stack of offheroes and no one comes here to complain about it imagine watching the team i mentioned above remaining players dont play as healers and wont play as such and no tanks because not their main do you think they would get to higher ranks how many matches would they win do you really think they would cap hanamura first i wish all those peoples were always matched together in competitive they would learn a bit about a teamoriented game we have to switch heroes its good for you for your game and for your development i love winston and torbjorn but i play as ana mercyrein zarya roadhog junkrat zennyatta any hero my team needs
Overwatch,not_removed,even though the games win balances itself out the sr doesnt necessarily balances itself because of winlose streaks if you lose games in a row then win lose win you are at but still lost more sr than what you gained because of those consecutive loses of course it could also be the other way around but that is more luck than statistics so even if you are consistent there is a chance you will never be placed in your real sr
Overwatch,not_removed,solo queue will place you where you belong as an individual in this team game after enough games played as long as you play at a consistent level not really its a team game with very little carrying potential yes individual skill does matter in some degree but it requires balanced teams to have a real effect as as overexaggeration best player in the world with potatoes would not go very high while potato with good players would easily go to high ranks
Overwatch,not_removed,youre half right ill take it you tilt easily ha ha i know i sound super salty on here but actually in game i generally keep it to myself when somebody goes pro attack torb on the other side of the map i do my best to work around it inside though yeah im just tired of it i always log off after consecutive bullshit losses because yes it does dishearten one when you lose to nonsense like that losing to being outplayed isnt near as bad losing because of something that shouldnt have happened is another story its a different skill than playing as a it very much is and its a game i enjoy much much more i often found playing against stacks is just better attitudes all around it feels more sporty if that makes any sense the losing teams still compliment the winning team instead of trash talking and you feel better about your loss because hey they were just plain better you still gave it your best
Overwatch,not_removed,or your group rank is correct you play mechanically below your rank but have teamwork and coordination above your rank so it averages out but since teamwork and coordination are worth less when solo queueing your solo rank suffers
Overwatch,not_removed,i can maintain my stats playing solo heals kills accuracy etc but when we lose because of the pro genjiwidowhanzo combo we all lose rank i get nothing for my individual performance be it good or bad if i wasnt playing at my rank id be bringing my entire team down when we six stack in which case these must be really good players to keep moving up but if that were the case they wouldnt have had trouble moving up solo according to you
Overwatch,not_removed,i got pretty lucky i was playing with randoms and of us worked really well together so we stayed as a group found more we worked with really good and kept them added friends decided were gonna play wed and fri nights and that was that fun fact it was a widow that brought us all together
Overwatch,not_removed,reportedly i cant tell from personal experience because i usually single or duoqueue i think thats why streamers and pros usually trioqueue at most on streams its more of a rumor but there is some evidence to support it
Overwatch,not_removed,i can play i should clarify by saying that but percent of the time i play lucio
Overwatch,not_removed,not every hero should be viable on every map ana reinhardt lucio soldier these should be changed to be niche for specific maps as well itll force people to actually try out new heroes for new purposes
Overwatch,not_removed,interesting i havent watched a lot of pro play lately i just had poor success with him on that map ill have to check out some games thanks
Overwatch,not_removed,that really depends on the enemy comp ill give you an extreme example that happened last night in qp we had a widow in our team that was pretty good but the enemy team had reinhardt orisa symmetra and zarya with that many shields she was totally useless if she would have switched for anything else even with a below average performance we would have capped the first point of course widow is already a niche pick but similar could be said about other heroes if the enemy team is very good against your team and people are not flexible enough to switch
Overwatch,not_removed,its kinda something in balance of the situation or tanks were reinhart and dva our healers were zennyata mercy me before the switch and ana pos damage nerf and our dps was a reaper as you see there is some problems in the comp sure ana and rein work with everything and dvareaper could combo with reinana well could but a combo in gold is really rare but there is a major issue there no way to effective damage unless were at close distance even if we had less dps and we used zens orb of discord as offensive measure the little distance we would have would make other dps like pharah and soldier eat the team alive even with rein shield we needed a hitscan and the reaper would not switch so i made the decision try i do play qp with dps as training even being a main healer trying be flexible if the dps was a main soldier or mccre even a main pharah we could try the triplehealer comp but in the situation we were i really think would not work with no switchs
Overwatch,not_removed,this if you keep positivity and use your best you might actually steamroll
Overwatch,not_removed,this not only helps you improve at the game it also helps you improve as a person which might make you communicate better with your team and help you win matches
Overwatch,not_removed,people think working with the team means do what i say nope when you tell someone to switch you are saying i know more about this game and more about what you can play than you do the issue is the ones who know the most about the game are generally the ones who dont tell people to switch the higher up you go the less people complain about class picks
Overwatch,not_removed,and who decided that youre the captain who knows what the team needs were talking about a game in plat here the torb was plat and the guys playing with him were plat tbh at plat assuming that torb places his turrets semi intelligently he is a hero that can carry pretty hard because accuracy players remember this is plat suddenly get so yeah i honestly doubt that torb was the issue
Overwatch,not_removed,im not op so i cant argue for this specific case but in general goldplat is a crowded place where individual skill starts to fade a bit and teamplaycoordination kicks in to divide the playerbase from winners and losers right now there are many high hp heroes and barriers around on the other hand good pharah players dominate in plat and low diamond those heroes i named before counter torb hard in the lower tiers torb and symetra are devastating but usually there is a certain level of coordinationskill in which these heroes just lose impact same as mccree not effective in lower tiers pretty doable in highter tiers of cause there are some gm junkratstorbs but this one isnt one of them and probably never will be and yes even if he isnt bad overall he is holding other players of his team back because even if you play well a loss is a loss
Overwatch,not_removed,theres a difference between contributing the same and trying to contribute more even if you try and contribute more and fail youre doing better than the person who doesnt try and contributes nothing just because your level of skill puts you below that other persons at that point in time doesnt make you the same as them its the variance that counts that git playing attack torb might after straight losses decide to actually make an effort and when they make an effort they play better than you the tragedy there is that if they actually played better continually theyd go up in rank but they dont for whatever reason they could just get bored easilly or theyre purposfully deranking theyre scared of getting harder match ups or whatever
Overwatch,not_removed,yeah its kind of selfish to not even have one support and one tank hero youre decent with it you cant possibly suck with every single support and tank character but be good with a dps character
Overwatch,not_removed,in quake arena pro players would jump or ad spam depending on what weapon the other player was using in close quarters jumping is usually best since it gives you the highest amount of movement when fighting long range against mccree for example then yeah you want to ad spam not jump
Overwatch,not_removed,sorry for such a brash response a touchy subject for me apparently hahaha
Overwatch,not_removed,attack sym is my new flavor of the moment played her most of the day sunday and maintained a win rate with her for the day
Overwatch,not_removed,picking a non meta hero is not a reason to use the report button sorry and no is not trolling just because someones picking a hero that is in the game he is there for a reason also you cant report someone for not picking a tank if you want to is not trolling and is not an official rule or something thats what you people dont understand people can go play and pick dps supports no one should care if they try to play and they dont go suicide or other trolling like that as i said is not a rule to pick a certain hero
Overwatch,not_removed,owwch so you read practicing in what that dude said somehow you also assume really awful things way too quickly like it or not the guy is right also dont throw around the mighty but if you arent helping your team its a bannable offense its not a goddamn bannable offense not to pick a goddamn healer even if theres just one its a bannable offense to play poorly intentionally not to pick poorly intentionally
Overwatch,not_removed,i am convinced you are trolling at this point so i am just gonna end this cya enjoy losing your silver games and blaming your teammates
Overwatch,not_removed,i play whoever i want but right now its symm only so op cant make me xd
Overwatch,not_removed,yea this happen way too much i usually play healer in ranked lucio or ana and i often ask for healer or some tanks then everyone agree with me all dps start saying yea someone switch plz or hey random dps hero switch for tank plz while playing dps themselves then they start insulting each other
Overwatch,not_removed,i hate the standoff of early evening qp on weekdays i work and want to enjoy the few games i get to play i tend to be flexible but theres a certain point where watching your dps as a support fail to do their role gets the better of me then i pick my main and get flamed i dont mind playing tank as much if there is at least one healer as they can do some work towards the objective these are just my thoughts on the game but i cant see it maintaining popularity within the next year hero releases are too slow and what they have released so far has either been underwhelming or if you are to believe professional players have broken the game ana same with maps i loved this game to bits at launch but now it just feels like an unenthusiastic handjob sure im not going to pass it up but i dont come away feeling good about it
Overwatch,not_removed,had a match where i was playing as mercy and requested that we have a healer since we were taking a lot of damage one of the dps players asked me to go healer then shrugs
Overwatch,not_removed,i just said yea its qp and i wanna play genji
Overwatch,not_removed,exactly i dont care whos responsible for disrupting your idea of a perfect meta you are the one id rather not play with because everything youre saying is offensive and doesnt help anybody with anything but they might have a pharah and our reaper refuses to switch to hit scan they might refuse to switch because you called them a cunt before the match started
Overwatch,not_removed,my gf was told to pick a good tank on her second ever game with orissa in qp they demanded she explain why she picked her over zarya i demanded they explain why they are so mad in quickplay i shit you not they replied with something along the lines of because you questioned my demands how these people have enough basic instincts to continue breathing amazes me
Overwatch,not_removed,thats probably a good idea i always leave both on in every game mode hoping that somebody will start saying something useful nope as much as i like to think im thickskinned constant negative bombardment of complaints whining blaming flaming always has a detrimental effect on my mood even if the griefer isnt blaming me directly just having that prevalent negativity throughout the whole match really detracts from the overall experience especially in qp if you arent having fun why the hell are you even playing
Overwatch,not_removed,my general goto solution is to open with something goofy ill take a silly voice and quip some movie line reference or whatever most of the time i dont get a reply and just continue on with the game in silence sometimes ill get a hello or a positive response in return and we keep talking throughout the game in rare cases my goofy greeting tilts somebody and i mute him quicker than a tourist looking for a bathroom in mexico
Overwatch,not_removed,lol gonna have to start sending that to people
Overwatch,not_removed,i can at least understand why people get tilted in comp theres an arbitrary number on the line i get the feeling some people equate their rank to self worth so that number means everything and once those people have to cooperate with other human beings its like the entire world revolves around them elo hell is real i was a god at rank but now im forever forsaken to the quagmire of platinum because of my useless teammates seriously where is my team ive got gold medals pathetic they then proceed to die by themselves while the whole team is waiting to respawn
Overwatch,not_removed,we have an unranked mode its there in the week downtime after a season in case youve never played it its generally seen as even trollier than qp
Overwatch,not_removed,i like this idea a lot i specifically like playing as tank or support so an uncoordinated qp team doesnt to a lot for my development at the same time if i go into comp i feel like im holding the team back
Overwatch,not_removed,still have to go with no healer or no tank in qp so you cant learn to play around them either comp is the only place t truly practice new heroes hey buddy this happens in ranked from bronze to low gold it took me forever to get to gold out of bronze
Overwatch,not_removed,thats the thing theres no proper way to play qp some people use it as a way to chill and screw around or try new heroes some others as a way to practise or warmup for ranked and they are both valid saying im gonna try a hero that i have no idea how to use its alright or going im gonna pick my main and do my best to win and try to work with my team is also a valid way to enjoy qp but as soon as you start rudely teling other people how to play qp we have problems
Overwatch,not_removed,at least theres a chance you made him as miserable as he makes others thats something
Overwatch,not_removed,i was going to let it go before i realized the guy never played competitive after hundreds of hours on the game honestly i guess i was feeling petty in light of this information so i wanted the person to know how obnoxious their flaming and behavior was even if i got zero medals the point still remained that it was meaningless qp and i was practicing a hero for competitive however with the medals i felt personally vindicated and wanted to throw it back at them like i said i realize this was petty but their behavior was unnecessary sometimes a little shit talking can be fun especially when it is initiated by someone else in a qp game of all places
Overwatch,not_removed,mmm not really for a guy designed to take on tanks hes not very good at killing tanks i mean hes countered super hard by tanks like roadhog who are super common
Overwatch,not_removed,i would classify every hero as circumstantial at the worst though
Overwatch,not_removed,well reapers also pretty effective against roadhog or pretty much any tank in general if theyre skilled enough
Overwatch,not_removed,yeah i agree as winston reaper isnt that scary but bastion is terrifying and roadhog is still pretty scary post nerf too
Overwatch,not_removed,that might be fair i play on na where nearly everyone speaks english as their primary language i but the eu servers can be tough
Overwatch,not_removed,thats true though if they cant say anything constructive id prefer if they just kept their shit to themselves tbh
Overwatch,not_removed,in a game span sure you might see some fluctuations over the course of games though the system will adjust you accordingly streaks balance themselves out too people like to think they see trolls all the time because it feels more impactful to their rating if someone is getting autolosses every couple games then that is not normal and most likely that person is doing something in their game that is causing the problem there is some percentage of games that you will win or lose regardless of whether or not you play at your best in a team game its the games where both teams are playing even and your ability to step up or not determines whether you are climbing falling or staying the same
Overwatch,not_removed,streaks dont apply until the or game in a streak youre just seeing variations in sr gainslosses because of team sr differences and how well blizzards algorithm thinks you played
Overwatch,not_removed,with an appropriate matchmaking system this is already factored in since the other players skill is being taken into account you will never get a game as imbalanced as you are mentioning as i noted in another post there will be games you cant win and cant lose because its a team game and sometimes your teammates play far above or below their normal skill level your rating will largely be determined by your performance in the games in between
Overwatch,not_removed,ouch ill be honest i feel sorry for the widowmaker more than anyone that game mustve been one uphill battle id debate whether or not youd have capped the first point though of course i wasnt there but switching wouldnt have necessarily turned the tables entirely more like swivelled it around a few centimetres then again maybe thats just what you needed
Overwatch,not_removed,ah so its more for that specific team comp i can definitely see the weakness at range although to be fair ana would be alright i suppose it wouldnt have worked out too well in that example although i think like you said it could still work just wondering are you a decent tank player you could have offered to switch to tank so that the reinhardtdva could switch to dps as an alternative
Overwatch,not_removed,will say might is a key word there though competitive feels kind of down to luck in my opinion and also connection
Overwatch,not_removed,ah yes typing on a phone i know that its inconvenient at times its okay
Overwatch,not_removed,there is a difference between playing to win and playing to improve
Overwatch,not_removed,sometimes can be toxic
Overwatch,not_removed,when you tell someone to switch you are saying i know more about this game and more about what you can play than you do no theyre saying please dude ive seen you run in and die alone times in a row id really like to not lose the game because youre so arrogant that having torb playtime is more important to you than the enjoyment of other players
Overwatch,not_removed,when you tell someone to switch you are saying i know more about this game and more about what you can play than you do if thats how you interpret it when someone asks you to switch then you need to pull the stick out of your ass
Overwatch,not_removed,gold plat is the place in which aim alone can carry you to diamond
Overwatch,not_removed,absolutely not true the otp player who doesnt try to contribute to the team but to play his favourite pony will contribute much more than you playing a hero you dont know how to play trying to fit in it is also highly probable that this torb only player is actually much better player than you overall i imagine that its much much harder to rank up playing non meta hero every single time the game will be lost in first round a lot or even before the game starts its only in high diamond that people stop caring about your picks if you have decent hours on that particular hero so if hes low diamond or lower his team will almost always be tilted as soon as he picks torb obviously having one locked on position is usually not very good playing around someone is also not many people want to do more inflexible players matched together would lead to disaster but dont assume for a second that this player is worse than you chances are he isnt and if you actually stopped arguing about his pick youd probably have higher chances of winning than the enemy team that has mediocre flex players
Overwatch,not_removed,thats great i need to learn how to play her
Overwatch,not_removed,picking poorly intentionally is the same thing as intentionally playing bad listen i have been dealing with this in competitive for quite a while now and it is the main reason why every season i place very high plat low diamond and never maintain that level i try teaming up with others i try solo queueing and playing what the team needs and almost every single game there is a guy who goes hanzo or torb or widow this is on console mind you and waits until we lose the first rounds to switch if ever and by that time our composition is in shambles from people trying to switch to make up for what we lack due to the troll pick sometimes they will even go out as their newly picked hero get killed and then switch back to who they were originally i often message these people and ask why they waited until the usually final round to switch your comment and uphantasmeow s comment are essentially the issue they always have the same response you care too much its just a game this is my account you take this too seriously these people believe that it is entirely acceptable to play just for funsies in competitive because they dont really care about their sr and just want to play who they want to play even if that means they are trying their best the bottom line is the other team will not always have or guys on it who dont care who dont play to strengthen their team you can tell when they do because you are steam rolling the other team and they have a hanzo who isnt hitting anything or a widow who keeps being eliminated by your genjitracer at the end of the day this is a team game to consistently win it requires people who are willing to fill a role and that role is whatever role the team needs it indicates a severe lack of immaturity to join a competitive gametype and then not want to be legitimately competitive look i get it of us are not professional gamers nor do we play this game for any kind of financial or personal gain other than enjoying it this does not change the fact that a lot of us play competitive to rise through the ranks reach sr we never obtained before hence the reason they make it a big todo when you reach a career highseason high and crush the other team if you dont want to play within a very vague version of the meta more so just a team build that makes sense and have a realistic chance at winning just go play quick play you are frankly just ruining the game for those who do want to take it seriously
Overwatch,not_removed,lol youre talking about a climb to diamond as an accomplishment and im trolling im trying to help you theres better players out there than you especially if youre only hitting diamond playing solely as dps maybe give them a shot its a winwin ya know
Overwatch,not_removed,how do you know its truely sym you want to play and not op secretly manipulating you
Overwatch,not_removed,lol im the zarya in comp going really are we only going to run one tank get off torb and help me zarya really needs a second tank we play so much better when we can trade shield time with people
Overwatch,not_removed,ive been in so many matches where the dps start attacking each other and we need another more crucial role why i mean unless you think you can carry the team to victory with your great dps plays alone why do you think it shouldnt be you that switches one of those games where they were fighting amongst each other they didnt switch until the very end ah yes now we have that second tank and the enemy team has on the capture point in the third round when they beat us in the previous two now we will surely win
Overwatch,not_removed,just play zen dps and heals p
Overwatch,not_removed,remindme year
Overwatch,not_removed,yeah a lot of the time you have to remind yourself that if you met this person in real life you would rule them out as a dysfunctional weirdo immediately and never interact with them again missing the normal social cues online its easy to fall into the trap of trying to reason with them
Overwatch,not_removed,yeah i am far from a thinskinned person but i really do not enjoy being the brunt of tantruming team mates like i really want to play sombra in competitive after hours practice on qp with her new buff so far i am winlossdraw but its getting real hard to click her on the choice screen because theres a very good chance someone is going to go full belligerent retard straight away and i just dont want to have to deal with them
Overwatch,not_removed,hahaha i will always try to talk in comp but i have just given up on qp too many shit heads that get way too bent out of shape
Overwatch,not_removed,i know but week practice is hardly enough also it is a trollish ranked because comp season is over and all the people there is bored and got nothing better to do if it existed during the whole season unranked might actually be better
Overwatch,not_removed,i would definitely play unranked over quickplay to warm up for competitive and practice new heros i see a few problems though splitting the playerbase even further lack of incentives for people to play unranked and the possibility of trolling im already experiencing minute wait times for most modes other than qp so adding in an additional mode could lead to longer waits as for incentives we could earn exp and cp possibly while playing unranked while not affecting our mmrsr to combat trolling unranked could still use mmr for matchmaking maybe and i guess have the reporting capability for people who arent taking the unranked seriously all this said i love that quick play is casual and i dont want that to change i dont really know that an unranked competitive mode is exactly necessary when competitive itself is kind of a joke in its sr system where you can swing hundreds of sr due to luck and winloss streaks
Overwatch,not_removed,i agree im mostly a support main there are times where i cant get a tank so i just switch to widow and consider it full practice mode
Overwatch,not_removed,not lucio id probably include solider and zarya in that group as well at least in diamond
Overwatch,not_removed,only if the hog misses his hook as a hog main i find reaper very easy to deal with and save my hook for him first
Overwatch,not_removed,reaper used to be good against roadhog but now with hook roadhog can one shot any health hero
Overwatch,not_removed,except roadhog can oneshot reaper and reaper has to be inside of hogs effective range to do really do damage
Overwatch,not_removed,in a game span sure you might see some fluctuations over the course of games though the system will adjust you accordingly my spreadsheets got matches so far this season ive climbed from gold into plat dropped back to gold climbed back to plat and am back in gold currently all real movement positive or negative has been streakbased ie the exact opposite of the prevailing wisdom games played around the winloss mark result in relatively negligible sr movement in either direction but once you get past wins or losses in a row you get serious traction people like to think they see trolls all the time because it feels more impactful to their rating out of matches ive seen draws and ive seen the following folks leave cases of being on a team where someone left cases of someone on an enemy team losing cases of matches being cancelled due to a player leaving in the first minutes so over games leavers appear more common than draws i play all week long and leavers tend to cluster a lot harder on weekends if people are weekenders they may be exposed to leavers in a lopsided fashion its the games where both teams are playing even and your ability to step up or not determines whether you are climbing falling or staying the same thats a great sentiment but it isnt true from the data the only thing that appears to matter is winning and ideally winning in lengthy streaks note i dont track throwers most of the time i might do that for season or start that shortly there are altogether too many cases where someone starts picking offheroes or silently switching off heals or sitting in a corner playing with themselves usually that starts after bickering between any two party members for any reason at all its the equivalent of people throwing temper tantrums that happens so often and is the primary reason i only play five to ten games a night instead of fifteen to twenty i can only tolerate my fellow man for so long
Overwatch,not_removed,you might be correct it was just a quick example you can make it the point still stands you are effectively but still lost much more sr
Overwatch,not_removed,stats dont matter many decisions and plays you make in a game that build up to a win arent recorded in numbers and stats dont give enough context exactly so how in the world can their system properly place you playing solo if i get thrown into a team with dps that refuse to switch i pick support to try and keep them alive we lose same team i say fuck it go torb cause were gonna lose anyway we lose thats sr for me regardless of how i play if i heal the ever living dog shit out of them and we lose if i run around in circles in the spawn room thats sr lost because of the rest of the team who i get matched with is completely out of my control unless i stack and saying the other team faces the same problem and im the only constant is saying flipping a coin times will land you heads and tails grab a coin and let me know how that works out for you yes i could get lucky and the reds get the dummies more than me and im sure that happens for some people thats how you get those people in masters that still cant work as a team but for others blue gets the dummies more often than not and they get stuck in a rank they dont deserve sometimes im not shitting on blizz saying they need to do a better job i dont know if its even possible to do a better job im just saying six stacking with constants is a lot better at rankingplacing you because it removes so much of the random bs you have to deal with
Overwatch,not_removed,of course i cant be sure that we would have capped maybe the player is a real clunker at other heroes but the issue was that we had issues going through the chokepoint in eichenwalde and each time we went through our team got really close from capping the point each time the point i wanted to make though is that as much as you are good on a specific hero to evaluate the situation and adapt would most likely be required in the scenario that you described where everyone play their best hero im normally very flexible in comp i always tell my team that if someone is in a role they are not comfortable i will switch with them but even if i play my best tank zarya there are moments where even my capacity lucio would be better
Overwatch,not_removed,the only role in moment i do think im playing at my current sr rank is support my best dps play would be sombra how is a dpssupport hybrid and for tanks im learning zarya and orisa in qp but still im dont have confidence im ready for comp with them edit overwatch is my first fps so my aiming is still at medium to low making the role of dps really hard for me tanks are also something else im really need get a better game sense to use them at their maximum as mercy is fast thanks to her guardian angel and i dont have to aim anything with her i can give priority to my game sense so the results were better than with most of the other characters
Overwatch,not_removed,the otp player who doesnt try to contribute to the team but to play his favourite pony will contribute much more than you you playing a hero you dont know how to play trying to fit in i never said that i was talking about when you do have a decent roster of characters youre good with if youre picking characters youre terrible with then yes youre not playing the team game any more than the otp player is it is also highly probable that this torb only player is actually much better player than you overall i did said this that was pretty much my point my point was that if always attack torb actually learned more than just torb theyd be much higher rank because if they actually tried rather than sticking with one character theyd naturally win more games if youre stuck at bronze for example and you play more characters well for your skill level id consider you a better player than the otp player who should realistically be in silver or higher if they branched out if they can maintain their rank with their stubbourn onecharacter nonteamfriendly character then yes theyre better than you but they shouldnt be playing with you
Overwatch,not_removed,no youre just plain wrong if anything picking not poorly intentionally will be the same as playing bad intentionally for some people im coming just from like sr here but i think this is good enough pretty much all solo like this i have played torbjörn on attack before both for payload and koth while i rarely play him he is fun to play for me and i know my way around his kit i contribute we won those handful of games the big thing is how your team takes it if they hear someone going i wanna play attack torb that okay they can either hear i wanna throw the game or they can hear let me try out something depending on their reaction theres going to be a bias towards what they experience throughout the game you are the problem im also sure of this as much as you are sure that the torbjörns in competitive are they are playing the game for fun and they win often enough you play the game for the numbers and you win often enough lastly the argument about being in the same sr its a very implosive argument tossed away with a grunt and some gargling bah humbug but heres the core you care about sr those people do care about sr but maybe a bit less if you care about sr you should fucking realize that it has to come not from blind luck and constantly being carried by teammates but from your own participation and boy did they participate else they would be at less sr lastly this is the bit thrown around in all competitive environments with the numbers adapted to matter of the games you lose no matter what blame it on your team incompetence op shit move on of the games you win no matter how poorly you play your widow just wrecks everyone once they show so much as a pixel past the protection barrier of the spawn in only of the games your contribution matters focus on those instead of the ones where you lost and while torbjörn may have played a part in it you may also have been too rigid and unwilling to experiment this is okay you can be wrong if you want to but at the end you are wrong if they play better in games they enjoy youre utterly at fault for making them have less fun and repick hanzo into soldier and miss every shot im passionate about this because ive seen many many games fail due to flame wars due to an early pick and ive seen happy communication even after a loss because the game felt good winning is amazing but what does it ultimatively give you to see that number go up satisfaction and happiness you can find those in those difficult games too and winning in style is so cool
Overwatch,not_removed,pikcing a non meta hero is not a reason to use the report button sorry
Overwatch,not_removed,nothing better than the team switching to proper characters at the end of the game then almost reverse sweeping and finally losing maybe if we had started with that we might have won i hate people
Overwatch,not_removed,lol right because hes not the worst
Overwatch,not_removed,true although whenever i play as reaper i always try to bait the hook usually by attacking them until they either need to take a breather where i can land some easy headshots or use the hook where i can use wraith form to avoid it i guess im like the opposite of you i save my wraith form specifically for roadhog if im planning to engage him
Overwatch,not_removed,good point will say though if it was eichenwalde that choke point is a lot harder to get past than others i know what you mean though im probably on say pharah ive done well in games recently but havent tried her in competitive and done best with a mercy on our team so its probably not me so much as the mercy but im considering playing as her in competitive pharah seems really strong in goldplatinum i try to be flexible in competitive too i will say that ive been playing dps whenever i can though mostly because i feel like im winning more matches as say genji as opposed to lucio im more than happy to pick support or tank though so long as the dps players can play effectively otherwise i guess i feel a bit like reinhardt let me show you how its done voice lines aside im sorry that i dont play much healer in competitive and play tank only a bit more maybe i should improve on zenyatta in particular
Overwatch,not_removed,ah right welcome to fpses then id suggest trying out dps heroes in vs ai arcade or quick play when you can though mostly in the hopes of just practicing aiming maybe even switch to your caduceus blaster as mercy occasionally id say a good start for a dps for practicing aim could be either you can support your teammates with biotic field and your ult basically allows you to not worry about aiming theres also a high fire rate so accuracy is forgiven a bit more bastion sentry mode has a high spread but allows you to spray down enemies pretty easily especially at close range tank mode has splash damage but is very powerful for direct hits pharah since you can avoid getting hit from high in the air you have no damage falloff at range and rockets do a lot of damage and splash damage your ult is a bit trickier to use well but it generally involves going behind the enemy team when theyre distracted and coming from above and behind them i think or junkrat okay this is a bit of a stretch but theres still the splash damage youve also got steel trap to immobilise enemies and it feels very satisfying in general to bounce grenades off a wall into a room to hit an enemy or lobbing them over a choke point winston and symmetra might also be good starting picks as you can focus on positioning to avoid taking damage a bit more and develop aim and positioning as separate skills good luck though i believe in you i also like to play support sombra too the fact hacked health packs are now visible through walls really helps
Overwatch,not_removed,either you expressed yourself in a bit weird way or i ihave some problems with reading comprehension because i got the opposite points from your original comment because now it seems i agree with you completely
Overwatch,not_removed,as i stated its the people who pick a hanzo or a torb etc and when it does not work they do not switch listen ive played my share of torb and hanzo not really ever widow and it does work sometimes if the other team is just not countering you but if a guy goes attack torb and cant even get a turret down because a pharah is harassing him or something else he needs to switch straight up if you disagree with that you are wrong and thats the bottom line secondly as far as sr goes i know for a fact there are people in my sr range give or take lets say high plat low diamond and they are either on a second account dont care if they are not queued with their friends or whatever other reason and they have literally word for word told me this they are playing just to have fun they are not taking it seriously they are not interested in a win vs a loss because when their friends get on they will take it seriously or what have you this is a problem also i know these numbers arent everything to go off of but if someone instalocks a torb for example and you check their career profile for the past and current competitive seasons and they show like a win rate when they have many characters who are more conventionally viable who have as much or more playtime and are in the high range they are being a detriment to their team this is a team game and while you may just so happen to win a game here and there as attack torb the numbers do not lie at the end of the day pick a hero you are more likely to win with if you dont have fun playing them then go play quick play and play the characters you enjoy playing or learn to enjoy being more valuable to your team you can bold that i am wrong all you want but the facts are the facts and again numbers dont lie
Overwatch,not_removed,never said anything about nonmeta but if you are instalocking widow on console rounds and if applicable and not getting any eliminations you are being a detriment to your team
Overwatch,not_removed,i dont know what you mean by this
Overwatch,not_removed,last season i had a good win rate while healing i used to win more as dps in the first season but i realized that if you pick the right support you can carry your team just as much i used to think i need to play more zenyatta lucio etc but to pick the right support can be even more important than picking the right dps my mindset is a bit more individualistic now and it worked recently ill always switch to a zenyatta regardless of the need for group healing if i have good targets i can kill or help kill if i need to support and they have good divers ill switch to lucio just so i can survive longer you have to think you team will never help you peel the diver if my team is grouping well or i can use ana well ill pick her i suck at at the other support completely
Overwatch,not_removed,i do switch to caduceus blaster when there no one to heal or boost my most proud moment was killing a flanking reaper some seconds before a fiveman grav enemy ultis and do my second fiveman rez in the game o i will take the tips thanks for the help o
Overwatch,not_removed,again you cant report someone for playing a hero bad maybe hes just noob with that hero and then maybe hes just an asshole because hes playing widow there but still not a reason to use the report button hes no trolling hes doing his best playing widow even if his best is killing target in rounds you people who think that someone should play something because thats how pro players play or thats the way this competitive game should be played are the assholes tough let the people pick what they want if they try to win the game with those heroes and not just jump and press click random on the map is a game that have no rules in what you should and not pick
Overwatch,not_removed,the worst a character can be is circumstantial no character is useless in every situation other characters are more universal for power or consistency reasons lucio is very consistent so he isnt the worst where worst means circumstantial reaper in diamond only works if the player using him is very good with him and you dont need a hitscan or a true flanker as well as having a few characters that reaper counters on the other team otherwise its probably better to play someone else characters like mei and symmetra are somewhat similar to reaper but usually have more utility
Overwatch,not_removed,so zenyatta might be a better pick if i feel like the dps players could do with dealing a bit more damage i definitely feel like i should practice now im mostly playing as lucio when it comes to support heroes although im thinking of playing as mercy and ana more particularly mercy since the caduceus blaster is fun to use also its great that orbs of destruction no longer have spread that was annoying to deal with
Overwatch,not_removed,no problem hope you improve caduceus blaster is a lot of fun to use too partly due to mercys voicelines you might not want to tell your friends about that medic wait thats me clear also that sounds like a great in game moment meanwhile i still havent gotten the huge rez achievement
Overwatch,not_removed,on the other hand the report function will be used for those who are not realistically trying to help their team win i will typically have zero problem with someone picking an offmeta hero or whatever you want to call it however if it is not working have said this many many times then they need to switch its as simple as that if you are not accomplishing anything you are no longer just not having any success doing it and have moved into being a complete detriment to your team you could be adding more healing laying down more dps providing more shielding or barriers or crowd control or a number of other things other than missing a bunch of sniper shots or scrambling around building a new turret every seconds because they keep getting destroyed if your pick is not working even if you are good at the character you pick and you are getting countered and dying every team fight you are supposed to switch this game is essentially rock paper scissors lizard spock now lets say the opponents pick scissors and you are rock but they then see you are rock and switch to paper now they are beating you every time do you continue to try to beat their paper be with your rock or do you now switch to a scissorhero and counter them so your team can win this is not a concept i am just inventing nor is it that hard to understand at the end of the day this is a competitive game type those that want to win primarily and have fun as a byproduct of that should not be forced to be lumped in with the ones who want to have fun and cross their fingers that leads to winning this is the reason there different divisions in competitive sports and many other activities throughout life there are casual semi competitive competitive tournament style literally you play in the league that best fits your level of competitiveness this is the core purpose of the sr system even though it unfortunately cant account for smurfsecond accounts people who get tilted and throw games in a higher sr those that have been carried those that solo queue and dont try unless their friends are queued with them the sr argument of oh they got that sr by being just as good as you is speculation at best mind you i dont think im god tier or anything but when i am gold in out of categories in nearly every single game regardless of my hero pick and lose just about half of my matches i can only blame myself so much i had a guy last night real scenario picked widow on attack of numbani i was pharah we all kinda pushed except the widow who hung back i got a pick soldier i believe flanked around the right caught of them on the stairs and popped my ultimate getting a triple kill the rest of the team fighting the other downstairs that should be point right the soldier i killed first comes from their spawn picks me while i am seeing widows shots zoom past him he immediately kills her as well granting his team enough time to recover from the kill wipes the remainder of my team and we start all over eventually do not cap the point round our widow is so bad a person picks widow on their team and repeatedly and i mean repeatedly capping our widow and completely owning them they do not hardly even get a shot off all round this widow is sniping everyone do you think id want them to switch no because i understand a good widow can win a game but do you think our widow if they realistically wanted to win should have stayed widow and kept trying or switched to help us defend the point maybe even harass their widow now theres my point we lost and i messaged them and asked why they stayed widow he said he was high and just fooling around and that he doesnt really care about his sr if you think this is an uncommon occurrence then live in ignorance i have an inbox full of conversations with people who i have simply asked why they stayed on x hero while the rest of our team was trying our best to switch to counter they all have the same excuses it is a rampant issue and the report button will be used for these scenarios whether you think it should or not
Overwatch,not_removed,i was prepared to say no ur playing her wrong but i agree with a lot of these one thing that strikes me is that shes a stealth character except unless shes invisible and just running around shes not very stealthy at all she should be able to do things while invisible she should be allowed to turn invisible to escape though make it have a longer cooldown in that case similar to tracers recall hacking without fear of that single stray bullet wrecking it id even be down for that emp nerf if it actually worked on everyone it hit
Overwatch,not_removed,yes to all of this
Overwatch,not_removed,in my experience most problems with sombra come from trying to use her stealth as a combat initiator that just doesnt work well by design i just use it in combination with the teleporter to get into advantageous positions or to escape their cooldowns work very smoothly with each other when used like that as for a buff im not really seeing a good reason for hack to be interrupted by damage its fairly inconvenient for the victim but its in no way a death sentence like a hook or a mei freeze is
Overwatch,not_removed,well thank you d but i will probably make a dick move and post this again today posting this too early wasnt a good choose
Overwatch,not_removed,its her counterplay im fine with that and it would be too op without damage interrupt
Overwatch,not_removed,the only reason i play is the hope of getting mayhem if they made that a separate mode i would be the happiest person on earth
Overwatch,not_removed,the pharah mercy only rein only and all soldier brawls are pretty bad sometimes i dont even know what brawl is going on what even is moba watch
Overwatch,not_removed,i enjoy qp more than any brawl ever made but i think theyre a good addition to the game and fun to play once or twice
Overwatch,not_removed,i personally like playing brawls but i agree that the pharahmercy brawl isnt that great and ive seen others post requesting to have it removed
Overwatch,not_removed,this is ilios brawl is really funny imo i only play it once in a while tho
Overwatch,not_removed,i actually like the rein brawl its so dumb but so much fun
Overwatch,not_removed,mobawatch overwatch with no hero switching
Overwatch,not_removed,me too the pharahmercy i dont mind i like the soldier one too i just dont like mystery heroes it has its own mode it shouldnt be included in with the other brawls
Overwatch,not_removed,if im not mistaken midgame you pause and click social
Overwatch,not_removed,ive looked there i cant find it
Overwatch,not_removed,nice
Overwatch,not_removed,looks awesome
Overwatch,not_removed,i missed one hmm were is it oh bang
Overwatch,not_removed,didnt get play of the game wtf
Overwatch,not_removed,tap tap tap tap tap tap tap tap tap tap tap tap tap tap tap tap tap tap tap tap tap tap tap tap tap tap tap tap tap tap tap tap tap tap tap tap tap tap tap tap tap tap tap tap tap tap tap tap tap tap tap tap tap tap tap tap tap tap tap tap tap tap tap tap tap tap tap tap tap tap tap tap tap fap tap tap tap tap tap tap tap tap tap tap tap
Overwatch,not_removed,just saw this on stream harbleu is definitely worthy of that spot
Overwatch,not_removed,harbleu stream is so entertaining to watch fully stacked of skilled plays and funny moments his laugh is contagious af too
Overwatch,not_removed,meanwhile in one of my competitive placement matches i did the exact opposite i went to hook a lucio and my hook went clean through him and hooked a dva nuke from like miles away ended up pulling it in and getting her a quad
Overwatch,not_removed,and this is why junkrat hired roadhog as bodyguard
Overwatch,not_removed,that was the sexiest roadhog save ive ever seen
Overwatch,not_removed,what kind of keypad is that even when he stands still theres clicking
Overwatch,not_removed,watching him play makes me realize how much i really suck at this game
Overwatch,not_removed,no rhine
Overwatch,not_removed,credits go to the streamer who can be found at wwwtwitchtvharbleu and the op uurbut brought to you by your friendly neighborhood bot happy new year
Overwatch,not_removed,nice earthshatter
Overwatch,not_removed,im gonna try this later on in qp today and end up scoring a triple kill for the enemy team
Overwatch,not_removed,how is this not higher rated holy shit
Overwatch,not_removed,ya see if i did that i would of somehow killed my entire team and lost us the game
Overwatch,not_removed,violence is usually the answer
Overwatch,not_removed,but did he kill the mechless dva at the end
Overwatch,not_removed,this guy has been nutty since his days
Overwatch,not_removed,ace clutch roadhog picks for real
Overwatch,not_removed,christ
Overwatch,not_removed,the roadhog we all aspire to be yet all manage to hook the nuke just wrong
Overwatch,not_removed,didnt save the symmetra
Overwatch,not_removed,you know what time it is roadhog time
Overwatch,not_removed,no rein just no
Overwatch,not_removed,funnily enough he proceeded to hook a dva nuke into his team later that night killing himself and other teammates
Overwatch,not_removed,unbelievable
Overwatch,not_removed,that was insane but the best part was furiously hitting q on the way down to ult on the rein
Overwatch,not_removed,meanwhile potg is bastion in turret mode
Overwatch,not_removed,one of the best pure awarenesshook master plays ive seen on this sub
Overwatch,not_removed,could someone explain to me the animation canceling he does with the heal and ult right after he hooks the mccree the heal looks to have alot shorter duration than it normally has
Overwatch,not_removed,how do you get that framrate without any lag
Overwatch,not_removed,sick heal
Overwatch,not_removed,wow look at that a roadhog actually thinking before he hooks the mek instead of just suiciding
Overwatch,not_removed,welcome to competitive games lol
Overwatch,not_removed,you think thats bad watch competitive smash games
Overwatch,not_removed,i see that lone fap you put in there and i appreciate it
Overwatch,not_removed,i am disappointed i read the entire post hoping to find a fap in those taps d
Overwatch,not_removed,hes now
Overwatch,not_removed,i think hes top worthy
Overwatch,not_removed,hes funny and really good at the game
Overwatch,not_removed,nothing but positive vibes and hook accuracy
Overwatch,not_removed,miles km post feedback in rtometric
Overwatch,not_removed,was it on temple of anubis point a week or two ago
Overwatch,not_removed,hes never really standing still at those times even when it appears that he is he is still hitting the keypad very briefly for small movements
Overwatch,not_removed,harbleu is one of the nicest overwatch streamers definitely check him out
Overwatch,not_removed,lmao just noticed that why the fuck did he do that
Overwatch,not_removed,would have wouldve
Overwatch,not_removed,why would you kill her you simply takes turns punching her around with your whole team until she gets tired of the rape and jumps off the nearest cliff
Overwatch,not_removed,
Overwatch,not_removed,let us never forget that he has been a master of two games you might be right but im guessing it just feels longer when youre playing
Overwatch,not_removed,have pc newer than years old
Overwatch,not_removed,players not thinking is probably a problem with your rank
Overwatch,not_removed,what pro team are you on
Overwatch,not_removed,any streamer thats really skilled really i watched a dspstanky stream and he just murders his keyboard
Overwatch,not_removed,or starcraft ii games professionals go up to apm or higher at times
Overwatch,not_removed,
Overwatch,not_removed,there is one though
Overwatch,not_removed,he has a really deep voice for his age
Overwatch,not_removed,he was top once
Overwatch,not_removed,way to rub it in bot
Overwatch,not_removed,how embarrassing
Overwatch,not_removed,im a bot bleep bloop someone has linked to this thread from another place on reddit footerif you follow any of the above links please respect the rules of reddit and dont vote in the other threads rtotesmessenger messagecomposetortotesmessenger bot
Overwatch,not_removed,nope last night on the final push of kings row
Overwatch,not_removed,he says at the end that he got booped off
Overwatch,not_removed,nah man thats not how we operate around here
Overwatch,not_removed,god i remember watching this live what a champ
Overwatch,not_removed,yes its an alienware alpha please dont tell me that computer is a mistake i know it is i just cant afford a new one
Overwatch,not_removed,im talking about how he thought for an escape before simply suiciding the mek most roadhog players just hook it to save their team which is good but never do anything to save themselves
Overwatch,not_removed,and wow so many downvotes i thought there are good players here on reddit guess i was wrong
Overwatch,not_removed,the bane of rmechanicalkeyboards
Overwatch,not_removed,i thought the record was only somewhere in the low range c
Overwatch,not_removed,holy gods youre right god damned coding d i should have cheated and controlfed the first time but i tried being honorable
Overwatch,not_removed,dad
Overwatch,not_removed,how old is he
Overwatch,not_removed,he was rank at one point last season so close yet so far
Overwatch,not_removed,who are the current best roadhogs
Overwatch,not_removed,native english speakers make the same mistake so id say youre already ahead of the curve
Overwatch,not_removed,cant tell if youre legitimately serious or not
Overwatch,not_removed,ive heard that westballz falco melee player has been recorded at or so apm and that that was near the highest sc levels so i think its closer to must be time to raise your apm
Overwatch,not_removed,no youre right it wasnt there before you gave me the good idea so i edited my comment youre still honoraburu
Overwatch,not_removed,
Overwatch,not_removed,
Overwatch,not_removed,with a little bit of training he could get to the top i tell ya
Overwatch,not_removed,he has youtube videos whose names start with rank so i assumed he was at some point edit just went to look it up and it says rank roadhog player which could mean hes the best at roadhog or is the best and also plays roadhog
Overwatch,not_removed,important to distinguish between best and highest sr harbs a contender for one of the best roadhogs in the west but no one knows much about the korean teams at this point
Overwatch,not_removed,evermore
Overwatch,not_removed,hymzi taimou harbleu are all valid contenders for spot id say
Overwatch,not_removed,good
Overwatch,not_removed,wezballz is in fire
Overwatch,not_removed,no hes now
Overwatch,not_removed,he means best roadhog
Overwatch,not_removed,not sure why youre being downvoted isnt he still the
Overwatch,not_removed,yes and the first to hit
Overwatch,not_removed,im not sure its fair to call him the best roadhog for sure hes the best at carrying comp games as his sr suggests but he hasnt consistently shown how well he plays in professional games where going for risky soloq flanks ends up hurting more than helping id say hymzi and taimou have been extremely consistent on lan and their teams successes show that
Overwatch,not_removed,shouldve gotten gold with that surprising amount of damage
Overwatch,not_removed,surprising amount of damage
Overwatch,not_removed,a mercy with gold in kills compared to two tjorbjorns on the team what kind of wizardry is this
Overwatch,not_removed,why are you like this
Overwatch,not_removed,good thing you showed the victory in your screenshot
Overwatch,not_removed,everybody underestimates mercy but that ends today
Overwatch,not_removed,a very fast game i guess never seen golds on a mercy

Overwatch,not_removed,gotta love those wombo combos
Overwatch,not_removed,id like to know the definitive answer too as well as what time zone that answer applies to so i can choose what to buy with my credits at the last possible moment
Overwatch,not_removed,i was wondering this too and im in the us
Overwatch,not_removed,im guessing its according to the time at blizzard hq irvine california it could also be according to the gmt timezone im just guessing though none of this is accurate
Overwatch,not_removed,exactly
Overwatch,not_removed,i just checked the store and it says halloween loot boxes are available to purchase or earn in game until at pt not sure if this counts for pc other consoles or if you can also use your credits to purchase halloween items until this time as well but i would assume so sorry yall i posted this in every relevant thread i could find because i wanted as many people as possible to know

Overwatch,not_removed,ill prob spend my coins right before midnight coming the pt time just to be safe
Overwatch,not_removed,ah my friends what is with all this standing around you must raise your shields and dance with me source vid
Overwatch,not_removed,honestly not that entertaining but extremely well tracked floating text makes me love it anyway
Overwatch,not_removed,thanks for the honest feedback
Overwatch,not_removed,i cant format for my life sorry
Overwatch,not_removed,thats not really a bug it was just placed on top of the payload and it doesnt have physics
Overwatch,not_removed,i do not believe the devs intended for this to happen therefor it is a bug
Overwatch,not_removed,scrims are on custom games so you can do them at any level you only need to be to participate in competitive ranked
Overwatch,not_removed,could i play compressive in those custom games so it wont count as towards my rank sorry of like esea or faceit or cevo
Overwatch,not_removed,yeah when you go on a custom game the first option on settings is to change it from quick play mode to competitive mode or skirmish mode comp matches in custom games wont count towards ranking they just play like a comp match
Overwatch,not_removed,alright thank you
Overwatch,not_removed,too big knockback while switching place with allies is a nice idea it would be far to trollyjumping off a cliff and switching places
Overwatch,not_removed,i see i think we dont have any hero that keeps the perimeter as a tank it should be a nice tool for a tank we always can nerf the distance d
Overwatch,not_removed,eu or us
Overwatch,not_removed,if youre on the us servers i can help out
Overwatch,not_removed,couldve been a smurf and just testing out if he could climb from losing all placements
Overwatch,not_removed,he wasnt a smurf he was one of those players where you knew he was destined to be stuck at silvergold the only thing i can think of is he found a good group of people to play with i have a variety of people on my friends list and one of them is a mcree i met at about who is a diamond now the game i met him in he completely carried the fuck out of my team and single handedly decimated the enemy team
Overwatch,not_removed,nvm i was just told that he had a friend play on his account and boost him lol i expect him to drop once he regains control
Overwatch,not_removed,ah still what you said prior could still be possible i was a gold scrub dps that was stuck in silver tier then met a couple of cool dudes that helped me train and play in high pressure environments like proper scrims and fullstack comps and it really helped me a lot im not even diamond but our average when we play is and they trust me enough on my mccree to dps which is insane even though im still plat
Overwatch,not_removed,rein was like fucking kill em all quick before they get back up
Overwatch,not_removed,dont mind the german language you should get what happens here nevertheless
Overwatch,not_removed,there is no counter to pharah except for a sniper so she has a counter
Overwatch,not_removed,mate there is a different between you being shit at this game to phara being op hint you suck
Overwatch,not_removed,every hitscan character counters her mccree widow bastion and even winston
Overwatch,not_removed,pharah is one of the heroes with the most counters in the game almost everyone with a hitscan component can pretty trivially shoot her out of the sky that means widowmaker mccree soldier torbs turret bastion ana certain projectile heroes can also counter her pretty handily like hanzo mei or torb himself then we have the heroes that counter her hard if she ever dares stray too close to the ground like roadhog dva and even genji add to that the fact that she is an easy target in anything but wide open spaces and her ult pretty much comes with builtin suicide functionality and you end up with a pretty balanced hero now pharah with a pocket mercy is a different beast thats true but its still easy to counter by just having your tank do his job and park his butt in front of the soldier so he can shoot both birds down
Overwatch,not_removed,so play widow and shoot her down
Overwatch,not_removed,all the idiots and blizzard fanboy come to comment saying stupid shit how can one be before himself
Overwatch,not_removed,its not because youre shit that pharah is op youre probably of those guys staying on soldier while not hitting a single shot
Overwatch,not_removed,no one needs to be a blizzard fanboy to see that this thread is full of salt and low skill directly from the op
Overwatch,not_removed,i agree but only because she carries too many games in diamond people say shes easy to deal with but in reality she never is
Overwatch,not_removed,competitive play im on isnt the gift i thought it would be even when we are successfully defending the objective i have had multiple games where someone just leaves i use to stick it out and just have fun but its not fun anymore then top it off i got back quick play and its just silly hero stacking its getting old is it gonna make me atop play not yet but its getting old i feel your pain bro im just trying to learn new characters in this state of flux and hope these people quickly fade out and i can enjoy the game fully again
Overwatch,not_removed,find a team so you dont have leavers if you lose then the other team was simply better i deranked down to from but after finding a good team ive gotten about ranks each night with only like games played i hardly trust any pug and i will not soloq until about or higher when voice chat is frequently used and everyone knows whats up
Overwatch,not_removed,can i have your account
Overwatch,not_removed,any recommendation on how to find a team my group of friends are casuals and id like to try and rank up with dedicated people
Overwatch,not_removed,i was lucky i had played against this mean reaper twice in quick play so when were finally on the same team i tell him that im glad were on the same team turns out that he saw me as the biggest threat and always focused me so he sent me a friend request and ive play comp with him and his friends since but for you i believe there is subreddits dedicated to find comp teams aswell as on other sites but you could also try out doing roughly the same as what happened to me if you see a good player in a game does not matter on which team praise their play try to send a friend request and slowly build up a team with these people
Overwatch,not_removed,i second this i play and when i play with really good people i tell them that im making a competitive team and if theyre interested send me a friend request i already have enough for a team and theyre all pretty cool too its not so hard making internet friends its just a lot of people are too shy to be the first one to talk
Overwatch,not_removed,my issue comes from not thinking im good enough which is half true and half me being hard on myself hopefully anyways xd ill give it a shot thanks guys
Overwatch,not_removed,no thank you bots would just leeroy in and feed ulti charge to the enemies
Overwatch,not_removed,a difficult proposition on the one hand it could work provided the bots default locked into roles that must be less aware like a zenyatta or roadhog and not a reinhardt or genji on the other hand balancing bot difficulty to the current group would be an important factor as will basic bot ai commands itll never be good but i can forsee it being better than nothing at all
Overwatch,not_removed,thats why they probably shouldnt let the diablo guys do bot ai
Overwatch,not_removed,bots are already restricted to playing as soldier reaper bastion roadhog zarya and zenyatta
Overwatch,not_removed,i want to see a team of one player and five bots kicking the ass of their enemies and winning
Overwatch,not_removed,kinda looks like the genji deflected the hook
Overwatch,not_removed,can someone explain this happened to me multiple times
Overwatch,not_removed,maybe the allied genji body has a frame right when he dies that blocks projectiles like hogs hook
Overwatch,not_removed,how can a friendly genji deflect the hook
Overwatch,not_removed,what do you mean happened to you multiple times do you have more clips what were he circumstances of the other times my best guess is the genji deflected it and then swift striked out of the deflect
Overwatch,not_removed,i only saved this one since it happened multiple times also the genji is on my team and the one behind rein was ana i dont think there were a deflection from any other genji
Overwatch,not_removed,dang idk
Overwatch,not_removed,i try not to judge my own team until we start playing because sometimes people can be amazing even with subpar picks but i do get wary of meis on my team until were outside the spawn area without having been icewalled
Overwatch,not_removed,hanzo i had yesterday a game on ptr where he killed me times in a row without even aiming at me i was just randomly walking by while he aimed at someone else also ptr yeah arrows with the hitbox of a truck no thanks
Overwatch,not_removed,meis i hate being frozen visually penetrated and then actually getting penetrated
Overwatch,not_removed,zarya because her beam always melts me c
Overwatch,not_removed,pharah
Overwatch,not_removed,as someone who plays a lot of roadhog and lately a lot of zarya and reinhardt definitely reaper
Overwatch,not_removed,symmetra smh for that gun of hers
Overwatch,not_removed,reaper
Overwatch,not_removed,anything that can kill mercy
Overwatch,not_removed,roadhog i just hate his noclip hook
Overwatch,not_removed,dva
Overwatch,not_removed,genji closely followed by widowmaker geni because fuck everything about genji widowmaker since i dont like snipers because they change the dynamic of the game in a negative way ana gets a pass because whilst shes a pain in the ass her lower damage split focus and inability to score hit kills keeps her in check
Overwatch,not_removed,tracer on the enemy team genji on mine player
Overwatch,not_removed,widowmakers nothing makes me want to ult more than going up against a widowmaker thats never missed a headshot in her life next to that its a genji even with the nerfs hes still too strong might help if they nerfed the right things instead of stuff no one ever complained about
Overwatch,not_removed,this is the only reason i drop from games if a mei delays the first approch on purpose she does not want my help
Overwatch,not_removed,i feel you man the hate i have for hanzo burns more than for any other heros
Overwatch,not_removed,i can never seem to aim that thing myself
Overwatch,not_removed,i am not looking forward to the damage buff in the next update genji isnt getting a damage buff in the next update
Overwatch,not_removed,what damage buff
Overwatch,not_removed,damage buff i thought it was all nerfs
Overwatch,not_removed,i find it actually really easy to take on a genji in a as lucio your passive heal makes you a lot harder to kill and now with the new changes to him it has become even easier
Overwatch,not_removed,agreed i played with someone wou played nothing but junkrat and hanzo and would refuse to switch even though we already had a hanzo
Overwatch,not_removed,i feel that and yet when i play pharah my rockets seem to be allergic to the enemy team
Overwatch,not_removed,so like a summer breeze too
Overwatch,not_removed,i agree with everything you had to say are you me
Overwatch,not_removed,did you take a look at her gun size
Overwatch,not_removed,youtube mirror
Overwatch,not_removed,that feel when you get a potg with no eliminations
Overwatch,not_removed,its like watching myself
Overwatch,not_removed,that must felt so satisfying
Overwatch,not_removed,not to mention they were a group of and we were a group of and a group of it was horrifically onesided
Overwatch,not_removed,based on feats alone i would say winston is the strongest doomfist could level a skyscraper and winston defeated him i would guess mei is the weakest lore wise having no combat experience
Overwatch,not_removed,are we talking about raw power or just substance connected to the story
Overwatch,not_removed,maybe symmetra but i dont know the extent of her hard light abilities like can she instantly build a mech the size of a building or at least summon a huge anvil to fall on peoples heads torbjorn is the main man when it comes to building weapons of mass destruction even if thats not his original intent so if he wanted he could build an army of doom as far as power goes i think reaper is the only one with magic powers zenyattas might be tech based mercys might be tech based but there is no tech in reapers and dont bring up nanobots that story is weak dont bring that weak shit up here that man if floating around with voodoo magic
Overwatch,not_removed,sombra s
Overwatch,not_removed,id say reaper if we go just by the lore everyone else only has one life reaper is the only one with a canon respawn so he can beat everyone else by attrition alone
Overwatch,not_removed,hahaha your a cunny funt
Overwatch,not_removed,what about hanzos dragons
Overwatch,not_removed,ummk
Overwatch,not_removed,hmm the dragons maybe its a poison smoke arrow with holographic projectors showing dragons on the smoke
Overwatch,not_removed,or it could actually be sorcery why would his tattoos glow when casting it
Overwatch,not_removed,could be could be
Overwatch,not_removed,its true that overwatchs cast is a powerfantasy buffet but youre still looking at things from a really mechanical perspective a powerfantasy deals with how the characters feel and what mental images they create and not just what they do genjis power fantasy is a ninja everybody knows what a ninja is and why its cool to be a ninja overwatch is tapping on those tropes and metaknowledge to prop up their characters and bring them something that feels cool a lot of archetypical characters like roadhog reinhardt mccree and bastion can be summed up like this theyre design meant to invoke some kind of archetypical herotype like a marksman a knight or a heavy then theres some original designs that rely more on their characterization to be appealing dva is a good example because the whole powerfantasy there is built on the fun of being in a powerful mech combined with the fun of owning people with a teenytiny korean girl junkrat and hanzo also rely a lot on their characterdesigns then there are the gameplayelements sometimes invoking a fantasy comes along with delivering a gameplayexperience that the player is familiar with from other games or sources mercy torbjörn pharah all have their mechanical side and their fantasy side but their tropes and gameplay are heavily tied to their external counterparts pharah obviosly is all about delivering that feeling of flight and free movement though each hero is an individual case and if i wanted to go into everything about every character i would have a lot of writing to do the point was the fantasy of a character in this context doesnt just mean what the gameplay feels like in general terms its what the player feels and sometimes you can describe it quite specifically by the goals that the devs have set for themselves in designing these heroes
Overwatch,not_removed,widowmaker fantasy of dat ass
Overwatch,not_removed,god the format
Overwatch,not_removed,fantasy britney spears more likely
Overwatch,not_removed,reinhardt fantasy of absolute protectiondenial of damage you forgot the smashing
Overwatch,not_removed,expected stuff left with some more faith in man
Overwatch,not_removed,i think this is referring more to their personalityappearancebackstory than in game skills the skills are built around the archetype of course but i think people are more fantasizing about being a quick firing fast talking cheery fighter pilot than specifically having the power to bend time if that were to be realized as a playable fantasy wed have a mage or a doctor no i think its more like the im no hero guy with a heart of gold and a voice of gruff traveling the world heroically saving lives and living up to the old code which has somehow forsaken him alternate fantasy realization the batman mccree the mystery man with a shady past and a justiceboner for setting it straight this sultry lone gunman is both dangerous and on a mission for the good side reaper stern dark slightly selfaware – maybe even tragically misunderstood reaper is a good guy gone bad – and now bears the responsibility of making the tough choices that no one else can just as he bears the responsibility of being the edgiest edgelord an actually unique magiclike thing in the ow universe thrust upon him with no say in the matter – cue identity crisis tracer casual capable fun and fast tracer is a lot like a normal person with an extraordinary life shes a bit disorganized and wishy washy but she tries her best and has a good heart – and lots of healthy relationships to show for it shes probably most relatable to spiderman imo pharah legacy child grew up idolizing heroes with big ambitions to join them only to miss the boat otherwise she is a highly trained aerial assault specialist with great hair and a badass face tattoo and someone needs the rocket launcher id say she was like dartagnon but even he seemed to have a bit more personality than pharah doesthis fantasy is definitely more based on abilities sombra the best hacker in the world who holds the keys to the storyline and has to hold her cards close to her chest secrets are her currency and she is working for only one side her own shes snarky manipulative and knows to make herself indispensable a specialist on infiltration who really plays that way shes best related to the idea of anonymous widowmaker this femme fatale pulls off some of the most important missions all by herself shes calculating cold and deadly with wit looks and skills in equal measure this woman relates best to an evil james bond who himself was morally ambiguous at best or the winter soldier when you factor in the tragic backstory stopping here because no one is going to read this anyway yes i know i skipped genji and wrote widows just wanted to round out team talon running themes i think a lot of people enjoy the idea of being compelled to be dark or evil for the greater good a lot of people go through life feeling misunderstood by their peers for reasons they cant understand with no outlets to discuss those aspects of themselves they believe others would find unpalatable characters like widow and reaper can really embody that alternatively something tragic like genji or ana are there for those who relate to the isolation and hardship but with less of a chip on their shoulder likewise we have heroes like tracer dva and lucio for those who relate more to positivity when it comes to overcoming hardship
Overwatch,not_removed,oh well yeah all that you said is right but i did this on my phone late at night so my post probably isnt the highest quality
Overwatch,not_removed,exactly mercys a guardian angel genjis a ninja widowmakers a sniper reinhardts a knight etc
Overwatch,not_removed,you cant cancel the game because the winning team doesnt deserve to miss out on rank points because of something someone on the other team did and you cant really only give the leaver a loss because then people just abuse that system two people queue together they switch off leaving when the game is going to be lost youve just halved the number of losses youre taking and theoretically doubled the amount of time before the harsh punishments start coming the best solution is probably to create a competitive backfilling queue but i dont even know what kind of incentives you could give to make people want to do that because it definitely cant be extra rank points and blizzard has proven that theyre damned stingy with the loot boxes
Overwatch,not_removed,huh
Overwatch,not_removed,switched to hanzo my lord
Overwatch,not_removed,we were playing random heroes on respawn so it wasnt my fault lol
Overwatch,not_removed,interesting idea but i think mercy will always be a stable pick solely because of her game changing ult
Overwatch,not_removed,i would rather her have more mobility that didnt require a teammate i mean she has wings but to get in the air you need phara to go up there first i mean sure you could go jump off somthing but then your just falling slowly like a phara who ran out of fuel her having more mobility would help her not to only rely your teammates looking out for you because if hes not your for sure gonna be the enemy number target because if theres one thing the red team doesnt want is your rezing your whole team after they just pulled of that super sweet ult and there feeling so proud of themselves and then they watch all that work just wash away in a gold light
Overwatch,not_removed,she has damage boost and res what else is there the fact that she can regen health after second is already hard enough to deal with along with her guardian angel allowing her to fly to safety lucio already has aoe healing covered so having mercy doing that would make his healing useless
Overwatch,not_removed,i dont believe shed get a boost to her healing since her res is seen as too powerful by most people edit her res is seen as powerful mainly by pro players because a team can wipe the other side with their ults and then a mercy flys in and uses res
Overwatch,not_removed,she just isnt though shes entirely absent from higher levels of play because her ult doesnt bring enough value to justify having a mercy on your team over the consistent value of other healers
Overwatch,not_removed,the medics overcharge i feel like thats an ultimate making eg genji and mercy invulnerable for any length of time is way too good you suddenly make mercy a required pocket healer for every dps in the game
Overwatch,not_removed,ana already does aoe healing from her biotic grenade im not suggesting anything that isnt already in the game her e would have a cooldown ofc
Overwatch,not_removed,id rather her ult got nerfed in some way if it gave the ow team room to improve the power levels of the rest of her kit also i feel like resurrect is the most overrated ability in the game tbh potentially super good is great and all but most of my resurrects are two people which doesnt feel particularly overwhelming sometimes nano boost causes a team kill sometimes transcendence and sound barrier win games mercy is only going to be hitting or resurrects once every games or so she could stand a power increase to help her along in those other games
Overwatch,not_removed,nerfing the ult would be weird max res of people then what decides who gets res if she is able to res people not too sure what kind of nerf would happen besides lowering the res range getting a res on or people might not seem like the most amazing thing but its just like any other ult in a way every other character might only kill or people with their ult and get every in games i do see your point but she might just need little changes instead of a giant buff and then reddit is flooded with nerf mercy post
Overwatch,not_removed,yeah im not saying shes useless but she is entirely absent from the higher tiers of play and that makes me sad
Overwatch,not_removed,ahhh my worry with this is that extra maximum hp already exists in the game as a part of torbjorn and symmetras kits adding one more in there and a weaker one by the sounds of it would be diluting their value when neither of them needs to be less powerful
Overwatch,not_removed,nerfing the ult would be weird max res of people theres plenty you could do to nerf the ult without nerfing the number of resurrected targets making it take longer to charge resurrecting targets with health rather than etc etc lots to tweak there getting a res on or people might not seem like the most amazing thing but its just like any other ult in a way i guess but the ability that lownumbers resurrects remind me of most is symmetras teleporter youre essentially bringing heroes back to the fight quicker which is fine thats a decent ult with the potential to turn an entire game just like every other ultimate ability in the game i dont think resurrect is as stupidly overpowered as people assume
Overwatch,not_removed,whoa there
Overwatch,not_removed,k just go melee range with mcree theres your pressure and excitement
Overwatch,not_removed,your teams average was higher than theirs i agree with you on the implementation but thats the reason it should retool your average so its current cumulative team instead of or initial cumulative team
Overwatch,not_removed,cheers love the cavalrys out
Overwatch,not_removed,nope
Overwatch,not_removed,a smart person learns from their mistakes a smarter person learns from others mistakes
Overwatch,not_removed,oh ya i forgot something at spawn
Overwatch,not_removed,yeah i think i left the oven on
Overwatch,not_removed,ive got this under contr gunshot i er forgot something in my lockerat gibraltar
Overwatch,not_removed,its funnier when you realize bastion didnt even kill her
Overwatch,not_removed,fck that im outta here love
Overwatch,not_removed,and mccree is like tracer come back here
Overwatch,not_removed,cheers love the cavalry is getting the fk outta here
Overwatch,not_removed,btw saying camping bastion is like saying wet water
Overwatch,not_removed,hey mei ever get that feeling of
Overwatch,not_removed,the fact that widow got to her first was savage
Overwatch,not_removed,complaining that bastion is camping is like complaining a homeless guy has more free time than you camping is all he can do hes a fucking turret defending a single room
Overwatch,not_removed,
Overwatch,not_removed,mei tracer lets gobang dead tracer thanks love but i dont want to go to hell today
Overwatch,not_removed,fuck this shit im out
Overwatch,not_removed,hmmm thats weird my teammates usually just keep running in anyways
Overwatch,not_removed,mei youre the real hero
Overwatch,not_removed,i guess tracer really doesnt want to run into widow again
Overwatch,not_removed,shot through the heart and youre to blame
Overwatch,not_removed,that was a widowmaker kill you thief
Overwatch,not_removed,we need to pick a direction tunnel bam the other one
Overwatch,not_removed,people watching that entrance people
Overwatch,not_removed,im watchin mei walk up there slowly bout to round the corner then pow dead by a widow while mccrees sittin there going like fuck another kill stolen
Overwatch,not_removed,hilarious
Overwatch,not_removed,nothing to do here
Overwatch,not_removed,yo was this a recent game or like weeks ago i swear i had something similar happen while playing tracer on hanamura
Overwatch,not_removed,hey tracer lets go kill the camping bastion upstai
Overwatch,not_removed,mccree come back tracer i just want to talk
Overwatch,not_removed,hanamura b is definitely one of the hardest spots for me to crack particularly with a less coordinated team how are you supposed to deal with a bastion or junkrat who sets up on that balcony with a decent team to back them up
Overwatch,not_removed,mei runs up and gets slaughtered tracer running back down to secretly message bastion just as planned thanks love
Overwatch,not_removed,enemy tracers continue the trend of never going where theyre supposed to
Overwatch,not_removed,nope nope nope nope nope nope
Overwatch,not_removed,yeano

Overwatch,not_removed,tracer
Overwatch,not_removed,its always fun watching a mei get slaughtered reminds me of my favorite play as bastian ever on gibralter near the end mei trying to flank im in regular bastian form shoot her a couple of times she runs into a room and freezes herself i run in turn into the turret and just wait and as soon as that ice block melts open fire and continue firing after she ice walled herself into a corner and continue firing after the mei hit the ground
Overwatch,not_removed,funnier thing is that you werent the one who killed mei lol
Overwatch,not_removed,uhm actually love i left something in the oven
Overwatch,not_removed,why you dont peek on walls
Overwatch,not_removed,then genji walks in
Overwatch,not_removed,widowmaker is the only one who hit mei
Overwatch,not_removed,that tracer knows whats up
Overwatch,not_removed,whats more unfun frozen then right clicked by mei one shot from widow one shot from hanzo head level spam
Overwatch,not_removed,i think the best part is widowmaker kills mei
Overwatch,not_removed,id be like oh bastion huh i got this suck on aaauuuggggghhhhh
Overwatch,not_removed,if it was just bastion i still would have gone in as tracer but with widow there this tracer made the right call
Overwatch,not_removed,
Overwatch,not_removed,bastion mei
Overwatch,not_removed,people still arent paying attention for widowmakers ultimate even when the announcement is sufficiently audible now no sneaking when its active group up or wait it out
Overwatch,not_removed,how do you upload xbox pogs to here or share it through here d
Overwatch,not_removed,i played a game where me as junkrat and a bastion teammate held down that spot people would just keep walking into my traps
Overwatch,not_removed,how do you have that crosshair
Overwatch,not_removed,yeah im gooooddd
Overwatch,not_removed,why not wait until both are comitted into the room since you have vision and teammates there could have easily baited both in
Overwatch,not_removed,thank you so much for this made my day

Overwatch,not_removed,widows got your back
Overwatch,not_removed,when i didnt see the elim popup i was desperately trying out if that was a setting i could toggle took a few watches to put it together
Overwatch,not_removed,bastion didnt even hit her if you look closely there are no hit markers
Overwatch,not_removed,now dont yall go leavin so soon
Overwatch,not_removed,brought to you by the redundancy department of redundancy
Overwatch,not_removed,its even better if you think what the rest of that tracers team are doing while bastion is doing jack shit
Overwatch,not_removed,i wasnt expecting her to die to widow half of me shrieked because of how unexpected that was and the other half of me laughed because of how she dropped so suddenly it was a weird sound
Overwatch,not_removed,but muh genetics
Overwatch,not_removed,mei tracer lets gobang ͡o ͜ʖ ͡o
Overwatch,not_removed,shes working with mei shes already condemned its just a matter of time

Overwatch,not_removed,really for me its usually friendly tracers that do that enemy ones are usually impeccably positioned
Overwatch,not_removed,i said the exact thing when i saw that
Overwatch,not_removed,the reticle is short crosshairs reticle bloom on and its pink
Overwatch,not_removed,in people blogs views since aug httpwwwredditcomryoutubefactsbotwikiindex
Overwatch,not_removed,even better is that he didnt even land a single bullet on her
Overwatch,not_removed,i let out a half shriek half laugh cause i wasnt expecting her to drop like that
Overwatch,not_removed,im a smart bastion i dont fear genji and its console so is harder for a genji to dance around me
Overwatch,not_removed,hanzo arrow needs to be made much smaller im fairly sure they increased its size accisently when they said the made it smaller last patch and i think roadhogs hook needs fixed always get grabbed around corners and such
Overwatch,not_removed,i uploaded my game clip from the xbox dvr website to my dropbox then from dropbox i upload the file to gfycat
Overwatch,not_removed,yeah because the kill log totally shows it was actually bastion
Overwatch,not_removed,do you know how hard it is to hit headshots on console
Overwatch,not_removed,youre free to leave
Overwatch,not_removed,this is no different than any of the other posts that make it to the top
Overwatch,not_removed,the world can always use more heroes to get in front of me
Overwatch,not_removed,if i saw satan die before me id think to myself is god up there and probably check myself

Overwatch,not_removed,
Overwatch,not_removed,dont worry i know the pain of downvote trolls i was worried this post wouldnt survive them but damn i was wrong
Overwatch,not_removed,if the enemy tracer is impeccably positioned they shouldnt be there they should be turning into hp of ult charge for the friendly team as fast as humanly possible
Overwatch,not_removed,ikr😂💔
Overwatch,not_removed,lol
Overwatch,not_removed,genji doesnt dance around you he walks through you
Overwatch,not_removed,honestly reason why most people think theyre grabbed around the corner is because the hook doesnt pull right away if it pulled instantly people would pretty much just realize they got hooked its designed in a really buggy fashion right now so theres a delay between hitting the hook and the target getting pulled
Overwatch,not_removed,and then die
Overwatch,not_removed,before you wreck yourself
Overwatch,not_removed,oh i think i left the kettle on
Overwatch,not_removed,i wish you could leave that on
Overwatch,not_removed,its a reference to deadpool
Overwatch,not_removed,did you just assume my appliance
Overwatch,not_removed,theres a time and place for these kinds of jokes and this was neither
Overwatch,not_removed,this is always funny no matter the context itll never get old or be used in a context that makes you look stupid nope
Overwatch,not_removed,did you see the one where zarya smacks mei in slowmotion when the game is ending so satisfying
Overwatch,not_removed,and dc comics
Overwatch,not_removed,i dont shoot reflecting genjis now the widow and mccree maybe
Overwatch,not_removed,
Overwatch,not_removed,maybe armor can be used to activate molten core for more time or to activate it for smaller intervals since the change in the way armor works for the turret its kind of one dimensional i think it would be cool if you could make the decision to save armor so you get more chances to use molten core
Overwatch,not_removed,did you just assume his joke
Overwatch,not_removed,give me more negative karma nerds
Overwatch,not_removed,
Overwatch,not_removed,here it is for anyone else interested i main mei but i still found this a good one httpsgfycatcomniceinsistentbison
Overwatch,not_removed,whewre is it
Overwatch,not_removed,no but i can picture it in my head 👌🏻
Overwatch,not_removed,genji doesnt reflect till you shoot you cant win
Overwatch,not_removed,dammit
Overwatch,not_removed,i feel like i should watch that show at some point
Overwatch,not_removed,i knew what awaited me on the other end of that link
Overwatch,not_removed,i had a dream once where molten core stayed active as long as you had scrap on you it consumed the scrap as a result
Overwatch,not_removed,yeah im sure blizzard has no idea what theyre doing when they balance ults
Overwatch,not_removed,damn it hes getting what he wants
Overwatch,not_removed,didnt you say youre the triggered one
Overwatch,not_removed,ok i shoot until he starts i loose then i melt his health
Overwatch,not_removed,you definitely should one of the best shows there is not just animation shows in general
Overwatch,not_removed,definitely i didnt watch it until i was in college and it was still great not just a kids show
Overwatch,not_removed,you really should its awesome
Overwatch,not_removed,what does that have to do with my statement i think blizzard is doing a fantastic job balancing and responding to problems its just right now torbjorn isnt really being picked a lot in competitive and people will downright flame you if you pick it in ranked im just throwing out a suggestion which i personally find an interesting idea to explore
Overwatch,not_removed,yeah ive heard plenty good things about it
Overwatch,not_removed,what show was that
Overwatch,not_removed,i think blizzard themselves has stated that they dont intentionally do that its the reason they tweaked bastion and torbjorn so much in the beta i think its completely fine for a hero to be easier to play so that newer players can play a hero they really like but the hero should also be pick able even if its just something niche on higher levels
Overwatch,not_removed,avatar the last airbender
Overwatch,not_removed,lol clearly its not a good time for you to do that if your team cant capitalize on you time to try another strat rather than get upset
Overwatch,not_removed,runs in by himself is surprised that his team isnt there lol i think i found the useless player right here
Overwatch,not_removed,sometimes people are not born as mlg pro as you
Overwatch,not_removed,sometime you have this games were people are simply out of sync it sucks but it happens questions is is there anything you can do yourself during the match to change this i had plenty of games where this happened to me and i got frustrated but then realized that i could have adjusted my playstyle to sync it with the others does it help you or your team when you constantly make it to the objective but then being killed because you are alone or would it not be better to group up with your team and push forward together i know that sometimes you playing with a group of people and none of them seems to go for the objective and rather waste their time chasing a tracergenji around the map but thats another story
Overwatch,not_removed,this is a joke right
Overwatch,not_removed,why do people always downvote posts why the negativity
Overwatch,not_removed,yes there are hacks for ow and yes they are no fun sometimes they are hard to see if sonething seems fishy report the player
Overwatch,not_removed,nothing they can do
Overwatch,not_removed,the hacks arent around as much but they are still there had a tracer last night that was killing our roadhog with only magazine from her smgs
Overwatch,not_removed,i like how the link you posted everyone saying maybe it was some who was really good got down voted to hell
Overwatch,not_removed,genjis shurikens arent hitscan though how the fuck would an aimbot even help he has to lead targets unless hes directly in their ass throwing right clicks
Overwatch,not_removed,how there arent hacks to increase damage that info is all server side and unless im wrong even if every bullet was a headshot it would still take a reload to kill a full health roadhog im guessing he wasnt full health or he was getting hit by something else as well
Overwatch,not_removed,he is going to lose his accounts fast
Overwatch,not_removed,well if youre close enough you can probably pretend theyre hitscan and with an aimbot there isnt really a drawback to being close so
Overwatch,not_removed,just what i was told by the roadhog he might have been but that was one of the rare matches where i wasnt on mah mercy to notice
Overwatch,not_removed,flank them with a tracer that has pulse bomb ready
Overwatch,not_removed,saw this on anubis they were in the kill room my team i just ran past them they were killed while relocating lol
Overwatch,not_removed,zarya reinhardt and ana reinhardt puts up his shield to give your dps the opportunity to start wailing on enemy reinhardts shield and starts advancing on flat terrain when his shields about to break zarya bubbles him and he charges if the enemy is in a small room zarya uses her alt fire to land explosions where they can deal damage around the enemy reinhardts shield junkrat can also pull this part off sometimes otherwise she just tries to burn down enemy shields and hp anas grenade prevents healing so mercy cant keep her teammates alive then starts healing your teams reinhardt if you have any flanking dps like genji or tracer they can jump behind the enemy trio as long as reinhardt or bastion turn around to deal with them the rest of your squad can punch through if your flanker dies to mercy you have other problems
Overwatch,not_removed,you need to flank them and spam the rein shield
Overwatch,not_removed,this happens to me on anubis all the time too usually they post up on the bridge and my team gets stuck at the choke if we push left the enemy team just repos to block the left flank
Overwatch,not_removed,roadhog that melt reins shield genji that can deflect bastion and flank on mercy reaper that can rape them in melee coming from above zarya that can get free against a stupid bastion you can also pick up hanzo his ultimate is free bastion kill sr here this is something i would suggest but i play mostly solo queue and it can be difficult to coordinate that many plays i main zarya and usually try to just organize group pushes then use my shield to tank bastion and burst him but a lot of times its difficult to even coordinate that
Overwatch,not_removed,that would have been smarter but they were in the kill room which was stupid lol
Overwatch,not_removed,as a roadhog main that hurt to watch
Overwatch,not_removed,youre in a robot with ittybitty wings and all of her fuel is made to go forward designwise im pretty sure she couldnt glide and gameplaywise it would just give her even more mobility shes finally in a pretty good place no need for buffs
Overwatch,not_removed,the reason mercy can float down is that so she can aim for something to grab onto whats the point for dva to do it
Overwatch,not_removed,dva is constructed like a plane not a helicopter that design cannot hover to even get her of the ground it needs a tremendous force forward and that you can do they only way she could get upwards movement is if she turned her face up thus the thrusters downwards you could in theory hover that way if you lower the thrust but you could only shoot the heavens
Overwatch,not_removed,because she has a jetpack there are times when id try to glide on dva because it makes sense she would be able to and just fallen to the ground itd be nice if she had a fuel mechanic or something like pharah to float down but it drains her boost ability
Overwatch,not_removed,the very same force that propels her upwards if it was lowered the thrust would allow her to hover for the same direction for the same amount of time or longer since shes using less energy
Overwatch,not_removed,guess you only read the first half of my post if any at all
Overwatch,not_removed,at least koth maps are less effort positionally
Overwatch,not_removed,sounds good until you start trying to grief them then you become the asshole
Overwatch,not_removed,keep it simple k
Overwatch,not_removed,no i will never switch off offensive bastion hanzo is always viable i almost got a kill last my turrets gets objective time right i dont need to be on the point s
Overwatch,not_removed,nah thats justice my friend
Overwatch,not_removed,are you against prison then or do we just tell criminals to have a nice day and let them go their own way people need to learn how to act its called giving them a taste of their own medicine its actually very effective
Overwatch,not_removed,not all crimes are violent a petty theft isnt violent but its still a crime same thing with tax fraud im having trouble with these presumptions
Overwatch,not_removed,shut the fuck up see that thats very different from even a petty crime youre a goof
Overwatch,not_removed,i never said they deserved to be imprisoned though did i i just said its not that bad to be an asshole right back at them please read my replies if anything this comment would shoe that you would agree with me
Overwatch,not_removed,they dont give a fuck ive called people dumb assholes over voice when they take bastion in comp and we immediately lose or hanzo fuck hanzo pickers on my team anyways if youre an asshole back to me i dont give a fuck at all youre just adding further toxicity ignoring them or me in that situation is far more prudent
Overwatch,not_removed,when d va and rienheardt got nanoboosted it was like watching a kaiju fight
Overwatch,not_removed,if reaper actually has or used to have a soft side to him that would actually make his story pretty sad like on the one hand taking in mccree as a recruit mightve simply been seeing someone that could be useful and doing the logical thing on the other hand what if gabriel took him in because he actually felt bad for the year olds situation and decided to give him a chance
Overwatch,not_removed,it feels really weird when our cheesy middle aged edgelord is actually depicted as a human being
Overwatch,not_removed,she looked up to him once now she has to look down cause she got a jetpack
Overwatch,not_removed,all credit goes to the original artist laurrantstumblrcom
Overwatch,not_removed,┏༼ •́ ╭╮ •̀ ༽┓ my feels
Overwatch,not_removed,love this new wave of reaper feels going on in the fan arts its nice to see people see him less as edgelord and more about his lore
Overwatch,not_removed,real human being and a real heroheroherohero
Overwatch,not_removed,this is kinda touching
Overwatch,not_removed,aw man i wasnt ready for feels this makes me really want an overwatch short featuring ana and pharah with lots of flashbacks of the early days of ow
Overwatch,not_removed,you lost today kidbut that doesnt mean you have to like it damn right
Overwatch,not_removed,come on babe
Overwatch,not_removed,i kinda think that people have a bad image of reyes because he has the resting bitch face syndrome like honestly have you seen any official artwork of reyes smiling
Overwatch,not_removed,anyone have an imgur mirror for this i totally support linking directly to the creators tumblr page but tumblr never works out right for me on mobile
Overwatch,not_removed,imgur for the mobile and work
Overwatch,not_removed,for additional feels consider my pet hypothesis that reyes is secretly pharahs father
Overwatch,not_removed,i cant be the only one that thinks reyes is not the real villain he doesnt seem like an evil mastermind just an edgelord caught up in a bigger scheme
Overwatch,not_removed,to clarify for anyone who doesnt feel like hunting down all the lore as it seems like thats what most folks are discussing formation and golden years reyes reaper and morrison were pulled from military if i recall into overwatch to help turn the tide against omnics in the war morrison was given command which pissed off reyes to no end both underwent a degree of supersolider regimen including some form of serums references this several other heroes joined overwatch from various organizations such as reinhardt from the crusaders tjorbjorn and ana who may have been unaffiliated eventually it become an organization unto itself rather than a squad once the war was over their role was relegated to peacekeeping duties fall of overwatch reyes eventually created a darker side of overwatch known as blackwatch which unsurprisingly conducted black operations that were kept off the books such as assassination possibly kidnapping and worse at some point reyes interacted with the deadlock gang and offered mcree the option to join them or face the alternative jail time or worse mcree accepted the offer and it appears reyes took him under his wing eventually word of blackwatchs dark ops became public information and people started to protest the existence of overwatch reyes and morrison met at a base for unknown reasons an as of yet unexplained explosion destroyed the base and left the two of them missing presumed dead rumor abounds as to the nature of this meeting and that of the explosion from reyes leading a coup to take overwatch for himself to external forces attempting to destroy the leadership of overwatch and blackwatch in one fell swoop aftermath with their leadership dead and the question of overwatchs necessity already being raised the organization was disbanded and many former members left to help the world in their own ways reinhardt wanders the land helping people in need where he finds them tjorbjorn seeks out and destroys his creations that were twisted beyond their purpose or used for things he never intended mcree has been avoiding trouble when he can as he is a wanted man but for some time had acted as a bounty hunter ana had played dead these many years until recently where she was attempting to gain info on talon mercy has wandered much like reinhardt finding people in need and offering her technology and medical expertise to help mei has been trying to keep an eye on weather and climate patterns the world is cooling and no one is entirely sure why morrison has been investigating ties of talon and stopping the odd conspiracy as he comes across it reyes has been hunting down former overwatch members and killing them for some inexplicable reason he has worked with talon but may not necessarily be a part of their organization
Overwatch,not_removed,happy panel happy panel sad panel woah really makes you think
Overwatch,not_removed,thats cute and sad and shit but i cant see pharah defeating reaper
Overwatch,not_removed,i cant help but think reapers story is a tragic one
Overwatch,not_removed,i originally thought that was the demoman lol
Overwatch,not_removed,can we get an imgur link
Overwatch,not_removed,fukin shotgun vs rocket and jp
Overwatch,not_removed,in the last panel there seems to be a text box above pharah but looks cut off why
Overwatch,not_removed,hang on a sec fking genji in the kitchen chopping onions
Overwatch,not_removed,a nonpharmercy shipoverwatch parents comic i never thought id see the day
Overwatch,not_removed,i didnt ask for this feels trip seriously though i would be unendingly happy if they make reaper a more complex character at least in lore it seemed that while he wasnt the friendliest person in overwatch that he could has possibly still been close to some of the original members id be kind of disappointed if hes just a comically evil character through and through
Overwatch,not_removed,read it as babe was real confused for a second
Overwatch,not_removed,came for the memes left with all the feels
Overwatch,not_removed,still a better love story than twilight
Overwatch,not_removed,im so glad the fan content on this subreddit went from being people making pictures of their waifus to becoming fanart with purpose fanart that makes you feel emotions whether they be sad or happy thats the kind of fanart i personally love im just never prepared for the feels
Overwatch,not_removed,goddamit they need to make a movie
Overwatch,not_removed,okay lets be honest reaper would still totally win in a with pharah hes got the experience the wit literally infinite shotguns and enough edge to cut you from a mile away
Overwatch,not_removed,oh good im so happy this made it onto reddit im glad everyone has enjoyed the feels
Overwatch,not_removed,nothing personnelkid
Overwatch,not_removed,awwww
Overwatch,not_removed,well im sad now
Overwatch,not_removed,
Overwatch,not_removed,and jesse didnt
Overwatch,not_removed,when you realize that this is a possibility
Overwatch,not_removed,
Overwatch,not_removed,pretty sure if she fired that she would take splash damage rank at most
Overwatch,not_removed,you never were a good student
Overwatch,not_removed,no clue why this triggered so many feels
Overwatch,not_removed,awwww this scene belongs in a tear jerker movie
Overwatch,not_removed,the feels
Overwatch,not_removed,shes a little close to him to be firing rockets isnt she
Overwatch,not_removed,wasnt prepared for the feels
