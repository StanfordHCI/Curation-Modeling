television,removed,were i a cynic id point out a couple of flaws i immediately see with this design since i am a cynic here they are first they highlight the slant in the n basically a backslash it could also be seen a fall eg with reports of having lost of their library a more minor point is the curve in the bottom it feels slightly off and when you take it with the highlighted slant youre left with two pillars on uneven ground the black background just seems darker more foreboding anyway thats just me looking at it for seconds im not a designer and im sure this logo cost like in design iterations and market testing and its probably great from a design perspective

television,removed,there is just nowhere to begin with this nonsense post wow
television,removed,the americans is a better show than person of interest and better call saul lol what
television,removed,usually when people make these posts they let the users have some of the unpopular opinions but youve gone ahead and taken them all to your question though i could never get into game of thrones i dont think i can call it overhyped because i havent seen enough of it to fairly judge its quality but i honestly cant think of another show ive heard talked about and hyped up as much as got in real life mondays at the office for me usually consist of people telling me i have to watch it when i explain why it isnt really for me though i hear its quite good which is a pretty agreeable statement i think they usually double down and tell me why i should just give it a second chance whats worse is that at this point ive had so much of it spoiled for me just by passively listening and without even trying that all the best moments would have lost their shock value its like they cant wrap their heads around someone not loving it dont get me wrong ive certainly been guilty of the exact same thing but after being on the other side of it i try not to be insistent when someone doesnt like something that i do
television,removed,youre entitled to your opinions my opinion is this is one of the shittiest post ive ever read
television,removed,i mean that shit is funny i dont know anything about the show but ive watched alot of cks standup two white situationally attractive siblings bring home two black situationally attractive hookups who are completely opposite of each other i dont know why the sister is wearing a head piece but i assume its bc of some cancer dealings and is probably bald like her brother if thats what was happening hilarious irony i didnt laugh out loud but i get it loud and clear if im reading the context the ops comments were tldr

television,removed,diamondback was interesting as a villain because it was his brother but the idea of diamondback being able to fight on equal footing with luke cage ruined it luke cage is practically impenetrable and super strong making him fight an enemy that is also practically impenetrable and super strong is like one average joe fighting another average joe diamondback should have been working for cottonmouth
television,removed,you just figured me out didnt you clap
television,removed,hayleys tits are bigger than i expected
television,removed,dave made it socially acceptable for a black person to host a sketch show and he made black humor more main stream before chapelle show the best youd get on tv was some standup routines on hbo or some other paid service with a very niche audience but dave brought racial humor into the main stream before the chappelle show black comedy was extremely white washed to the point of being ridiculous and completely unrealistic
television,removed,i felt it hit a nice highish level around episode toward episode after cottonmouth dropped of i lost interest and the diamondback reveal felt cheap and unearned plus diamondback was an extremely weak enemy in my eyes i mean i dont actively dislike it its still an ok show i just wish it was better the cast feels wasted a tighter narrative would have done wonders i think
television,removed,totally i think theres a version of diamondback that may have been a more respectable villain but the first half of the season did a poor job of foreshadowing that there was some estranged family member that had been fucking with cage for his whole life not to mention major plot points went completely unused or unexplained although the first half of the season sets up cage as this shadowy excop who was framed for something were never told what it was the reveal that it was his halfbrother makes even less sense because were never given any explanation as to how diamondback framed a cop in the first place prereveal diamondback suffers the same problem nothing about an arms dealer with close ties to a harlem mob boss screams bastard son of a georgia preacher its just convenient that he managed to create a criminal empire where cage washed up after escaping prison another convenient coincidence is how in addition to developing judas bullets from remnants of the attack on nyc hammer is also working on some supersuit which diamondback can use to frame or fight cage on equal footing the show spends an inordinate amount of time explaining what judas bullets are how they work and even where the come from but then just handwaves this other arguably more powerful tech

television,removed,in the tv subs its always like if you didnt like what i liked or vice versa its because of a shortcoming you have lack of attention not enough film school too influenced by this or that blind stupid lacking insight lacking life experience too set in your ways i mean fuck people like different things and they dont all like them for the same reasons i mean its interesting you enjoyed franks dialogue and why you liked it but my thinking it was fucking dreadful doesnt mean i failed to understand something

television,removed,classic redditor logic i dont like it so it must be a region
television,removed,i dont think thats a fair representation of many terfs outlooks its not that theyre crossdressing men its the fact that theyre not fully biologically women and as far as life experiences go shouldnt belong in the same sociological group if youre a mtf trans woman who transitioned in your early adulthood as most do you actually lacked many extremely formational events that young women experience when did they get their period when was the first time they were catcalled as a tween when did the hypersexualization of their body as a commodity happen the answer is that it didnt happen trans people totally deserve all the rights and respect in the world but i think its fucking disrespectful to the trials and tribulations that genetically born women go through to assume that men identify and thus transition later deserve the same title youre not a woman youre a trans woman and thats fine but women already have such a shitty short end of the stick dont cheapen their lives by being classically male patriarchy and taking and coopting whatever the fuck you want
television,removed,do not seek validation from systems that seek to oppress you do not forget that widely held perceptions of successful employment education marriage and family have white supremacist patriarchal roots when you purportedly fail in these institutions you are resisting oppression i hmm a hmmm no i cant twist that to make sense in any way
television,removed,i dont know about you but if i were running a business like that and the neighboring businesses had to close down due to something with my business id sure be unhappy youre trying to boil this down to them be greedy but its pretty rational to take issue with those sorts of things

television,removed,maybe if you dont take people seriously because they use some certain little special word that triggers you youre just a snowflake and you should address your personal issues before you make decisions about your political beliefs i suggest you find the nearest safespace organize a hugin and try to come to terms with the notion that there are words out there in planet earth that you dont like
television,removed,the left down voted you without making a valid fucking response good ol reddit

television,removed,i wrote somewhere on a doctor who thread i blame moffat and gatiss they were working on doctor who at the time but they used their train journeys over a couple years to develop series of sherlock because it wasnt in anyones radar they had plenty of time to groom it and tweak it until it was beautiful and that first series was beautiful but sherlock was so wildly popular that they had to produce series two faster than they expected and given that they were running doctor who simultaneously they really were overbooked and unable to give themselves fully to either programme at this point they shouldve bowed out of one or the other or diminished their roles somewhere or delegated more work to other people on at least one production but their egos couldnt allow themselves to give up either doctor who or sherlock so they continued with both programmes and both shows suffered for it they gave more effort to series of sherlock which wasnt as good as series and doctor who suffered then they spent more time focusing on doctor whos anniversary and the third series of sherlock was shite because of that ive said for years that gatiss and moffat should choose to focus on one programme and that since they created sherlock thatd be the logical way to go now chris chibnall is taking over as showrunner for doctor who which is great i love chibnall but he doesnt take over until next year in the meantime doctor who is still suffering and i dont actually have much hope for this next series of sherlock in fact if series is as bad as last series then it probably deserves to be cancelled and let cumberbatch and freeman get on with their careers ive loved both doctor who and sherlock and moffat and gatiss have gutted both programmes for me ill watch stuff that they write but im never again going to bother with anything either one of them produces at this point ill add that i found series better than series but i still harbour fanhate for moffat and gatiss for what they did to my favourite programmes

television,removed,season already felt like badly written fan fiction and season certainly hasnt improved they treat being smart as some kind of magical superpower instead of showing us some smart writing were just told oh yeah this or that person is super smart and then proceed to let that person act out some ridiculously stupid plan that only works because they can use smart magic like mind controlling people spoiler

television,removed,not a strawman but theres one glaring flaw that stands out it seems pretty weird that hes using an bythenelderly aides testimony years after the administration to assert that richard nixon harbored sinister and violent hatred for black americans given the volumes of history that detail nixons support for civil rights and close personal friendship with many black leaders nixon was a failure in a lot of ways — theres little to seriously suggest he was a racist or pushed policies to intentionally harm blacks or any other race

television,removed,youre getting a lot of awnser but its its like this imagen spongebob a fun childrens cartoon with lots of friends having fun and then it gets real spongebob doesnt have a father loses an arm trying to find him the old princess kidnapping old pervert in the mountain is just an old man with a heavy case of dementia searching for love it skips a lot from spongbob fun to adult topics there can be large jumps between the adult episodes but the episodes about long each so you can skip those that isnt to your liking theres quite a few of these series and one of my favorites is actully gravity falls which i recommend more as it is a better starter to kick of the genre with its two seasons long and is about twins visiting their uncle in the american wood landa the old man runs a tourist attration called the mystery shack and he rides on the rumors of paranormal activities and generally scams his customers the twins on the otherhand is starting to suspect that the paranormal activities are real this is one of those shows that perhaps shouldnt have been a kids show but disney toned it down so it could make the cut

television,removed,rosie would have to tear herself away from the buffet longer than she has in years to do so plus her blood sugar would get low and her knees are bad you know from being a fat slob
television,removed,i dont think thats it exactly liberals have time to circlejerk over feelings working conservatives arent in hollywood or liberal ny theyre in blue collar positions and may only think about politics once every years libs are currently letting the hate flow through them and guys like me are just sitting back with popcorn doing our normal per the usual we dont do marches for no reason or need hollywood actors to act out in order to make us aware how offended we should be even if hrc wouldve won we wouldve bitched for minutes and went back to work sjwism is the left and e womens march yesterday was a good indicator that women specifically didnt like trump objectifying them in a private conversation so like snl they will nag and shout down at the american public until we placate to their quirks and sensitivities ironically i see the left as the morality and thought police

television,removed,oh we got a baby killer planned parenthood was formed by a eugenics supporter who believed black babies should be killed today planned parenthood are times more likely to kill black babies im against the killing of babies for convenience i guess us republicans are just kinder people the waiting list for newborns is years long this is why people adopt from foreign countries dont be so selfish and let the human have a life experience its first kiss and the sun on its face ffs why do you support the deaths of so many black babies racist

television,removed,i agree with your assessment of the trulia thing if you look closely at the trulia valuation its basing the estimate off of the mayflower grace inn in washington connecticut that may have been the inspiration for stars hollow and perhaps even the style of the house but no way is it the same no way is lorelais house worth million i watched with my mom too when it was broadcasting and we watched the revival together too im there were parts i wasnt terribly excited about but overall i liked it
television,removed,ideas are bullet proof some cunt
television,removed,hold on though these are all memories that ford has allowed bernard to see are we sure they are the complete picture and the way that that scene is shown with arnold with the frankly whiter looking hands is not shown necessarily as a bernard or even dolores memory i personally think bernard has always been bernard a robot maybe the very first robot and ford has remade his backstory as a posthumous arnold lookalike to cover up some deeper truth about arnold and what happened surrounding his death
television,removed,its happiness retard

television,removed,do you actually know what an ad hominem attack is or do you just enjoy parroting phrases you hear on reddit that you consider to sound intellectual im not going to sit here and debate you its a matter of preference and opinion i think jon stewart is just as smug and smarmy as those he lampoons albeit maybe a bit more educated opinions are like assholes everyone has em and they all stink yep yours and mine on this subject smell like shit too have a good day

television,removed,this one still stings for me spiderman is my favorite superhero and spectacular spiderman is my favorite superhero cartoon ever i know people are more concerned about young justice getting a third season and i am among them and hope netflix picks it up but if i had to choose yj or ssm id go with ssm in a heartbeat there were so many nixed storylines that couldve developed the villains listed in uchrisdelis comment harrys eventual decline into a supervillain the relationship between peter and gwen evolving the possible appearance of the prowler captain george stacys death possible appearances of other marvel heroes if disney didnt cancel the show really i could see ssm crossover with avengers earths mightiest heroes hell josh keaton was originally gonna voice spidey in the emh episode featuring him before he was replaced lastminute with drake bell norman osborns eventual return i could go on but ive made my point marvel has been doing great with their movies and liveaction shows but have been failing with their animated shows the cancellation of spectacular spiderman was the cherry on top emh was cancelled as well in lieu of a lesser avengers show the gotg animated series is disappointing from what im hearing and dont get me started on agents of smash
television,removed,agreed evidence is in the fact they brought azaerel into it wish they would do more with bruce
television,removed,i like that it doesnt try to be more than it is i know its popular to shit on big bang but that is the best show i can think of to compare it to big bang is smug were so funny and clever no you arent neither show is genuinely funny they are both silly and the jokes are predictable and the acting sucks but of the two only broke girls gives the impression that it knows what it is

television,removed,were sorry but this video is not available in your region due to right restrictions
television,removed,blocked countries ca canada au australia
television,removed,yes
television,removed,you described really well my disillusionment with drwho i have been watching it for years but since moffat took over i feel its become less about the stories and more about emphasizing how kooky the doctor is theyve always done that which is a part of the reason i started watching to begin with but now it just feels too much and that watching has become no more than a conversation piece telling people you belong to an obscure niche
television,removed,yes that singinginsideacarwithcelebrities bit is terrible the way he uses this venue to show off his singing chops makes me cringe harder than anything else first time i saw it was with the rhcp and although the interactions between him and the guys were interesting and sometimes even funny every single song he was fabulously singing with them i was screaming inside shut the fuck up goddammit no one gives a fuck you know how to sing
television,removed,i loved that about donna and how ordinary she was and how well it played off tennant she might not be able to master how to control the tardis but she could call the doctor out for being a dick with such wonderfully honest snarkiness
television,removed,he really is though with what hes given hes become the only reason i watch now
television,removed,i didnt like any of it ill take my downvotes to go thanks
television,removed,lol same
television,removed,it is relative to the mainstream
television,removed,why are you so fucking stupid are you incapable of learning and thinking for yourself you need someone to hold your hand fucking pathetic
television,removed,lol they did that this year
television,removed,hardly weak women its the exact opposite you could accuse me of having a fetish for powerful sexy women who like cheating people that would be
television,removed,youre definitely right about the regional thing but i do not mean to say that doctor who is so obscure that only person per would even know what it is rather compared to mainstream shows like the example you took walking dead and then extreme examples like game of thrones doctor who is a fairly niche show and then on top of which there is the lore behind the show itself while a lot of people are familiar with the name even fewer are familiar with the overall premise of the show and so i feel like it becomes this combination of few people in your general presence who are familiar with the show or what it is about and then knowing more than the basic premise like for example i know a couple of people who would fight each other to be the first ones to point out a callback to the old drwho series prerussell tdavies era in the newer episodes those references that are put in there to make people go hah look old continuity but often have very little substance to them story wise it always seems to be that to those kinds of fans which i feel became way more prevalent with the moffat era are way more obsessed with who is the bigger whovian in their social circle than enjoying the show and its stories but its become harder and harder for me to justify enjoying the stories given how much it has shifted to be about how eccentric the doctor is and tip toeing around the mysteries of his background i thought the tennant era was a really worthy balance between those qualities
television,removed,why is this posted in rtelevision take your political bullshit to a relevant sub op

television,removed,christ all fucking mighty nothing about the first season implied that all men are rapists you moron
television,removed,changing hiring practices doesnt affect that though all it does is unfairly prejudices hiring practices against those in the industry right now
television,removed,on what basis do you say the industry isnt fair to them
television,removed,i dont agree at all with the assumption that a solution is necessary to the problem you described just because you dont have an equal number of men and women with desire to enter a specific industry doesnt mean there is a problem in the first place people should have equal rights and should of course have equal opportunity when applying for positions or entrance into an industry based on merit the thing is you arent starting this discussion from looking at discrimination first as a problem you are looking at the number of people in an industry and assuming it exists but the problem with that assumption is the thinking that if their were no inequality of opportunity present that this would result in equal representation in line with population at some point with these movements people seem to have confused the proposition of equal rights and opportunity with actually thinking that men and women are equal in each and every way and that if not for inherent cultural differences in society which need to be corrected would apply for each and every job in equal amounts and be hired proportionally i personally think it happened because gender equality has based its push on race equality and its just not the same situation since there are undeniable physical hormonal and psychological differences between men and women that mean even with all things being exactly equal you still would not get proportional employment in all industries i believe in equal opportunity for everyone and am very much against any discrimination but the sad thing is you are literally asking for discrimination to occur in order to force equal representation if there are more women than men in an industry because women prefer to enter that industry over men then i dont see that as a problem and vice versa if there are more men then women in an industry because discrimination occurs then that is definitely a problem that needs to be addressed dont start at the end result and assume the cause because thats flawed logic
television,removed,minorities were at theyre called minorities for reason fuckwit they shouldnt be at the same percentage as the majority else theyd be that fucking identity politics bullshit
television,removed,they dont have any arguments to respond with so they resort to calling names and using shaming tactics
television,removed,they all used it to get their jobs and increased pay complaining about it only after you age out of his favor is pathetic it makes them no better than prostitutes
television,removed,shame it wasnt a lot worse anyone working at fox deserved to be raped by dickwoves for the rest of their lives for what they have done to the world in the last years

television,removed,jesus christ calm down you sound like youre drunk at your own birthday party right after your girlfriend dumped you
television,removed,i think the fact he had an episode with revealing the truth makes it a twist regardless of what the director says and if its their history than we already guessed it when it was telegraphed that hes not real but his dad i hoped his dad was actually alive and had tricked the whole world and his son into thinking hes dead or not him at all that would have been insane and they could have taken evil corp down together or his dad could have been part of evil corp from the beginning or before so much easter potential for a dogshit emotional reveal for which the whole audience already knew and didnt need a fucking reveal sigh i could do better
television,removed,we already knew he manifested him and anyone could figure out that was his dad someone should have slapped the director in the face after they saw the second to last episodes script and especially the finale biggest letdown episodes of any show ive ever seen his dad should have been actually alive having tricked everyone into thinking hes dead now thats a reveal plot twist and awesomeness all wrapped into one instead of elliots season long psychosis being the scapegoat
television,removed,wow even whinier you actually think you have the right to expect people to love your submission

television,removed,a for all that are curious warning spoilers
television,removed,ah america where a man can go from making a parody video around sucking a nut sack to a hit show say what you want about this country but you cannot deny anything is possible

television,removed,acute acute is a word motion picture is cinema eva greens is diva and you are a fucking idiot
television,removed,fine maybe it isnt your type of show but perhaps you can explain what you hate about the show instead of slamming stupid one liner like a tool
television,removed,yep i think it was originally going to be some kind of response to the cease and desist that roiland got for making house of cosbys they were originally going to claim that it was an official back to the future video and see how fast they could get a cease and desist but roiland ended up liking the characters too much to go through with it or something like that i actually read about it just a couple weeks ago or so but i cant seem to find my original source now

television,removed,but if you insult someone on something they cannot change that is pretty low calling you a bitch because youre being a bitch is not insulting you based on something you cannot change you can totally change your behavior to not be a bitch think about it this way what is a stereotypical bitch someone that is whiny often rude complains about every little thing kinda reminds me of you honestly belligerent unreasonable malicious etc none of that behavior is exclusive to women get over it a word isnt inherently sexist what makes it sexist is the context not who it is directed towards youre a bitch does that mean all women are bitches no you people will do anything to try and start a fight its ridiculous at this point seriously sack the fuck up and stop being insulted by every single little thing

television,removed,well thats the thing i dont view all clinton supporters as collective assholes but someone calling out trump voters as such doesnt put you in much better light the same way how rthedonald doesnt speak for all of us but policies are what we may disagree on i cant imagine electing someone with a hard on for tpp eliminating import taxes from the same countries we owe great debts lift anything in your house and youll find a made in china stamp on it my father is a victim of nafta and allowed it to be an even easier task to put a made in america stamp on everything build of a product over seas keep a small of your company open and as long as you assemble and finish a product in america you can put a stamp on it while i understand not all unions being a great thing its one of the few ways we can at least pretend things are made and produced in america throw the rest to china we arent anything more then a low paid middle man i dont hate china because i disagree with making it super cheap and easy for them to take advantage and export all our workers for itwell maybe a bit but handing over whatever is left to give us a little dignity on doing it wheres the jobs you think what we do have left will accept the terms of giving back more to the worker why bother when they can save that wage increase and give back to pushing it over seas where they can do it for pennies on the dollar plus eliminate the ability to tax it i am not against a progressive socialism but she pretty much represents the opposite of keeping anything that makes profitable shit like that scares the hell out of me maybe trump isnt the solution but i feel like at worst hes under prepared he might do something right on accident hiring all the ceos and higher ups of our country may not be the worst thing to put us back on track financially but untill we even get to see the results we get to see ourselves rioting and murdering for causes that arent even proven or determined if he runs it down ill be on your side just the same to impeach or not reelect him but until then it would be great to see anyone take that under consideration over being pist that we didnt elect a woman who deserved because she simply was a woman who deserved it for time put in under that opinion id rather hire someones grandad or grandma that worked in a factory for years that closed down to things like nafta

television,removed,murder isnt inherently evil you can murder for good breivik is a hero who murdered radical liberals for their culturedestructive practices
television,removed,everyone i heard was raving about anthony hopkins and ed harris and theyre great but i dont find their stories interesting at all to me the best acting job in the show was thandie newton she crushed them spoilers below so if you havent finished season stop reading when the big bernard reveal happen i started to loose my affection for the show i dont agree that the show is boring but the i really am not that enthusiastic about any of the story lines delores finding her sentience and consciousness big fucking deal robots becoming self aware is a tired science fiction trope ford being forced out by the corporate interests yawn i dont give a fuck who owns the amusement park the conflict between him and the corporate interests was never fleshed out in a way to make me care william growing some balls and becoming the mib i guess all it takes is fucking an expensive blow up doll and beating the shit out of your future brother in law to grow some balls the mib finding the ultimate ride bigger yawn teddy not really doing anything bernard finding out he isnt human and is a arnold sort of galactica did the pick the cylon thing over a decade ago it was lame then it is lame now maeve becoming sentient and then somehow convincing a guy to help her be a diversion for security so dozens of people would be murdered because reasons maeve was really the highlight for me westworld did enough right to keep my watching and i will tune in for the next season but ended on a whimper
television,removed,lmao fucking brainwashed mongoloids in this thread along with shills they call it fake new so it must be fake
television,removed,downvote rating for colbert lol
television,removed,that sub is basically basement dwelling keyboard warrior autists who wouldnt know how to interact normally with another human being if their life depended on it its some online cancer spawned from
television,removed,if you didnt already know this inside out youve probably been watching fake news however im genuinely happy to inform new people or more likely fired for getting caught leaking questions but thats just my editorializing
television,removed,trump doesnt actually have any politics yea well thats where youre maybe not quite as clued in as the average american a presidents politics are pretty much useless their party runs the show the president is just a pawn a face regardless of what trump does or doesnt believe in the right wingers will have their way thats why every president makes all these promises during their campaign get lots of votes because of them and then never follow through the powers that be wont allow it
television,removed,can your same logic apply to crime statistics would that be profiling is it racist cuck
television,removed,i already told you that colbert doing the colbert report is comedy and you idiots keep talking about it like it is actual news and serious commentary fuck how many of you twits called john stewart an anchor and the hacks on the daily show correspondents
television,removed,criticizing hillary is like killing a buss full of mentally disabled children just too easy
television,removed,i watched lwt up until around the democratic national convention when a lot of us realized that john oliver was shilling for clinton even though she and the dnc completely cheated sanders and our democracy i even made a post about it that got brigaded by clinton supporters hahah did samantha bee demand accountability with clinton the dnc i dont watch her show so im genuinely curious i did try watching it once but it seemed like clinton propaganda but maybe i didnt give her enough of a chance
television,removed,this is what i dont like about her show and a lot of late night comedy really its the absolute certainty that youre right and making anyone who doesnt agree with you look like a retard taking some religious conservative and asking him a bunch of questions you know will get the response you want and editing it all together to make him look like a complete fool there are a lot of smart intelligent republicans and smart intelligent bernie supporters i would be much more interested in someone who can portray the other side as real people while finding some comedy in all of it
television,removed,dont get me wrong there are certainly pedophiles in power but this comet ping pong shit doesnt add up its almost like a witch hunt anyone who disagrees with them is a automatically sheep or shill too
television,removed,how true is the conspiracy i went on the sub before it got banned and i thought it was retarded complete nonsense
television,removed,john oliver le current year man i think not shoo shoo slimey limey
television,removed,the interesting this is why that insult in particular has such clear primacy in the altright vocabulary in the same general ballpark you could call people perverts freaks or just straight up betas which was indeed a big and common insult on the internet years ago now cuck really has become the predominant slur among the altright crowd and its interesting and to me funny because of the transparent connotations it has as an insult it communicates that the character person youre addressing is bad specifically by compromising with their masculinity and letting other men have sex with their wives it implicitly states that poor character lacking masculine potency and being submissive to other men with rapacious sexual appetites i also feel that it communicates rather clearly that women are objects for men to fight and posture over but thats a different matter its really fascinating to me how centered this new altright identity is around aggressive masculinity i hope people dont read this the wrong way this is not some feminazi condemnation of all men nothing of the sort i dont think theres anything inherently wrong with the male gender i think any such sweeping generalizations are absurd its just an observation that the altright community is absolutely fixated on projecting a vitriolic combative sense of masculinity and to me its hard not to see this as a case of empty barrels making a lot of noise that is the force urgency and anger behind the hypermasculine discourse of the altright just seems to indicate extreme frailty like theyre incredibly frightened their masculinity is in doubt and so they constantly challenge the potency and power of others to reassure themselves that they are real men bold and brash compared to all these weak cucks surrounding them in the end i find this absolutely hilarious as this insecurity undermines the portrait of strength they want to paint

television,removed,i think the autistic users of reddit enjoy a show like this because it conveys simplistic problems which they can follow and feel smart about understanding hot to follow i dont personally waste my time with this kind of show but i would highly recommend it for the autistic or those who watch shows with friendship in mind towards the characters i mean

television,removed,netflix have said though theyd like to have no geo blocks in the future so heres hoping the industry bends to their will welli hadnt even thought about it until just now but isnt it possible that the way this would actually be achieved would be by completely transitioning to only have netflix originals and no licensed content i mean thats pretty much the only way they could do it short of getting the laws in a lot of areas changed isnt it
television,removed,how the fuck is this related to tv retards
television,removed,that daniels character started off as the fucking man and as the show moved forward he became overshadowed by the other kick ass performances by charlie and all the supporting cast super cheesy show but its my kinda cheese sucks they cancelled

television,removed,keep crying white boy
television,removed,aww you wanna be a victim white person
television,removed,not shocking most of the people on here complaining that hes racist is white white people want to be victims so bad its insane
television,removed,your obvious insecurity whenever racism is mentioned in any context hell im sure the sight of obama triggers your mind
television,removed,its not better then breaking bad as a whole but it feels much more developed after two seasons than bb was its also incredibly old school in its pacing ive honestly never seen a show that is more patient with its storylines
television,removed,make american tv better again
television,removed,then perhaps why the hell would they bring in a nonexpert onto the show if they just brought him on the show to say fuck you notscientist then thats horrible the fact that they brought him onto the show means that they should at least show him the respect a guest deserves colbert does it maher does it im not really lashing out at you but rather for a talk show comedy or not the segmant was not alright
television,removed,any links for us canadians
television,removed,i think white people as yourself should stop getting offended whenever black people talk about their experiences mkay oh please let obama talk about doing something to help empower the black community and youll accuse him of being racist clown
television,removed,ive only seen snippets of the site once or twice they shouldve cancelled the daily show this guy is funnier than the daily show host who isnt funny at all
television,removed,thats your impression because whether you want to admit it or not part of you feels guilty for the racism in our society its purely psychological any criticism of the way whites treat blacks with regards to race relations triggers youdoesnt it oh come on admit it had he not talked about race at all or kept it on the low i highly doubt you would be this outspoken to you its the power that the majority in this country holds is under threat its slipping away and it drives you mad but do tell me about your black friends

television,removed,well you got me wrong i agree if it was popular it would have stayed on as far as my false premise id submit the literal hundreds of highlyupvoted comments that say they didnt like him because he kept saying everything was white peoples fault coupled with a general disdain for black lives matter and the like you have to have some pretty big cultural blinders on to not see the common thread through reddit the vast majority of its users are young suburban white dudes with basically no access to anything outside of their homogenous echo chambers the position it seems youre taking is that the pattern i think im noticing is made up out of thin air or worse made up to advance some diabolical antiwhite narrative thats fine i think the pattern is obvious

television,removed,so you pay the big company to give you your lives and texas storage wars wow fuck you for making assumptions about what i watch its my preference to watch things on tv you dont have to be a dbag about it
television,removed,this is nothing at all like what other people are describing

television,removed,stop speaking out of your ass then bernthal leaving had to do with the comics not darabont its pretty fucking clear unless youre dumb

television,removed,trumpfanskillurself lmao you seem like a nice person
television,removed,the show is arguably still coasting off of how good season was no it isnt this is an absurd statement also season wasnt even good the pilot was great but the rest of the season was nothing special at all vatos is probably one of the worst episodes of the entire show and it was released today you would never stop shitting on it
television,removed,at the same time him and colbert arent helping they talked shit about trump but didnt focus on any of hillarys flaws that is bias ideally media should be objective and not be full of shit just for ratings remember when jon went on crossfire and said youre hurting america well ironically he is doing the same thing crossfire did but in even if you are a comedian hit both candidates with truth bombs dont give hillary a free pass and attack trump only just because you are a democrat bias is bad that sums up the election with regard to media in a nutshell
television,removed,i dont watch fox news and am not a fan of conservative bias in the media either the difference is we can all agree that fox has a bias what we dont all agree on is that msnbc has a similar if not the same level of leftleaning bias and most liberals i know believe that cnn is balanced and thats the problem it is hard for people to see a bias when it follows their ideology
television,removed,and there is a very strong argument to be made that he is not qualified to be ag no there isnt he was a us attorney and the ag for the state of alabama fyi during his time as a us attorney he sued the state of alabama to desegregate schools and as alabama ag he fought to get the death penalty for the head of the kkk and sued that organization into nonexistence
television,removed,nightmarish illiberal bullshit better than nightmarish liberal bullshit
television,removed,fox owns fox news and also produce family guy does that mean family guy is right wing
television,removed,thats called shitposting they are mocking the ridiculousness of the metaphor i sincerely doubt they came up with a term to disparage themselves
television,removed,you must be dense
television,removed,lol theres no agenda reality has a wellknown liberal bias lololololol the amount of times ive heard that in response to pointing out media bias is insane and now crickets from the left
television,removed,i feel that way too theres no real evidence but theres so much circumstantial evidence that it cant just all be coincidence theres something going on there and theyre definitely speaking in code in the emails theyre on to something
television,removed,i think its sad how jon stewart preaches against the big bad unethical media as if he didnt make a career out of being a participant in it i mean this article may as well be an advertisement for jon stewart the article is fake news
television,removed,i dont want to believe that either but those places do exist i like to think the fbi is leading this online research privately trying to turn the court of public opinion against the clintons thats why the didnt charge her with anything over the emails theyre looking for a bigger fish involving the foundation

television,removed,yo post this at rfinesseboys man and sub
television,removed,sub to rfinesseboys homie
television,removed,i think in that case it ruined the surprise because the entire thing was all mystery and low in actual content once elliot left the jail it had no impact on the story it was all flash no substance but more importantly once you realized what was going on the fun was over westworld doesnt suffer from this issue as badly sure someone called all these theories after ep but then it was fun looking for clues so we realized yea there might be more than one timeline but how many who is part of which how are they going to intersect there were tons of false theories that were equally compelling the online theories might ruin the shock of the twist but shouldnt necessarily ruin the fun of the show so you have to structure your mysteries so that the mere guess of the answer basically confirms the true answer the leftovers did the biggest twist reveal of the last year that nobody online guessed and looking back it was incredibly obvious and fit in with the world of show perfectly
television,removed,it sucks its boring its lame its stupid it needs a plot it needs more tits
television,removed,for me twd was appointment viewing up until glenn got out from under the dumpster i quit cold turkey after that horseshit
television,removed,so today there was a news that cnn journalists joked about teumps plane crashing what is it news reporting bad sources or its just digging sht all day long cnn has apologized to donald trump after a producer was caught on camera joking with reporter suzanne malveaux about the presidentelects plane crashing the remark was made before a live shot on thursday the unidentified producer in footage obtained and posted on youtube by scott jones of ftv live can be heard saying that means his planes crashed no im kidding cnn released a statement friday saying the producer had been disciplined an unfortunate and inappropriate remark was made by one of our producers off camera yesterday cnn said in its statement we have apologized to the trump transition team and the producer has been disciplined

television,removed,i loved the first seasons especially the but didnt fancy the season much black sails is still one of favorite shows though and i will always watch too bad its the last season dominic from deadline doesnt seem to like the new season though he said black sails lost its wave im still going to watch the final season of course but im not as excited for it much anymore
television,removed,what does the pacing have to do with how stupidly the character was written i get now that this is a black sail dick sucking thread and not a place where youre supposed to genuinely discuss the show fyi there is a reason why this show is on fucking starz of all places and is ending in obscurity
television,removed,oh please you say you like trump because hes a god emperor who btfos all the libtard cucks when conservatives can start having an actual dialog let me know until then stop crying
television,removed,httpsmwatchcartoononlineioanimeadventuretime
television,removed,hahahaha we are very supportive of your right to speak freely however theres a line between genuine criticism and outright partisan hysteria your sub screams fire in a movie theatre on a daily basis thats not speech protected by the first amendment retracting a story a week after it goes viral is not an adequate remedy the damage has already been done and retractions dont go viral btw a retraction is an admission for publishing fake news
television,removed,im gonna get downvoted for warning you about this but the oa stands for the original angel and it is about magical dance moves dont be fooled by how polished the first or second episodes are

television,removed,lead rod
television,removed,oh boo hoo
television,removed,id rather get those cufflinks then the gift charlie sheen gave his wife and girlfriends
television,removed,crucify me but i felt the exact opposite season one felt like a glorified cinematography showcase with entire episodes of very little happening rambling dialogue that went nowhere a plot that falls apart at the slightest inspection with season the setting felt real the characters felt like real people instead of the tired goodcopwithdarksides something was always happening the dialogue felt like how real police would talk instead of lseudointellectual filler and the plot felt very tightly wound
television,removed,
television,removed,i know im going against the grain here and i know i will get plagued with all kinds of downvotes but im going to come out and say it anyway i completely disagree that this show was gold or as good as a steven spielberg movie its far from it imo characters were all one dimensional and too straight forward and a lot of the times just too damn campy for it to be considered gold or spielberg quality it may be spielbergesque but thats about it winonas acting was overtop with her arms flailing around emoting along with her overexaggerated facial expressions and the little old lady posture is her idea of a late thirty something mothers posture she looked as frail as my grandmother the cop character had like no depth and was dumb as rocks hey lets break back into the facility the same way i got caught last time and now how he gets out of things by punching which im not entirely sure if im upset at that or not its actually kind of funny how he just bull rushes every single problem in the damn show ok i will give him a pass lucas who in their right mind would keep around a friend that just nags negates bitches gets violent all the time it blew my mind when in the middle of the season toothless tells him that lucas is jealous because he lost his best friend i had no idea they were best friends nothing told me they were better friends to each other than the others oh they talked on the walkie talkie together biff eleven she could have been so much more interesting but instead she was just this gimmick to save the day she was just a prop piece nothing remotely interesting about her except that she has special abilities complete gimmick the entire bit of nancy what in the world was the point of having her in the story just complete wasted screen time the damn monster so eleven felt guilty for releasing the monster yet the monster is able to tear opens to either universes how do the two correlate the show doesnt say el feels guilty that the monster can pop in and out of either realm makes no sense why she felt guilt also its an upside down universe yet in the realm nothing else is alive except for the monster and anyone else who travels to it but this monster is a carnivore how did it even survive up until this point if el released it then its been trapped for god knows how long yet its still nimble and strong this show has its moments though the very first episode had a very great build up to the scare moments but thats about where it stops the scares dwindle as the season progresses the weak writing exposes weak characters as the story progresses and theres really nothing left that is redeeming about the show except for its retroelectronica musical score
television,removed,dont you have some bleach to drink
television,removed,ayy lmao
television,removed,much edgy wow such brave
television,removed,eh he did just because youre not foaming at the mouth doesnt mean youre not angry trevor is more perplexed than angry as most of us nonus viewers are as well we just cant believe that you allow it to go to such levels its just mindboggling for us
television,removed,see this is where i think people are wrong its perhaps the most watched political satire show that he is taking over taking over for a person who has won over i dont know consecutive emmys in a row or something for political satire he cant just go on and expect to just do the same format in the same style especially when half the writers left with jon to do other things there is a period in which one finds one flow and rythm and thats what trevor and the current daily show writers are trying out they tried multiple different things see if they work better or worse how it flows with trevors style and personality etc etc i good example for this is seth meyers he started his show on feb i watched it from then in the beginning he was aweful especially the first two months he didnt have anything down in my honest oppinnion but now look at him hes perhaps one of the best if not the best late night hosts and the show is really damn good i prefer it over colbert conan fallon and kimmel he came out of the left field and is taking over late night in my opinion and thats because he grew he adapted to the format his writers know what works now and write better content for him now so in the end i think that trevor will be just fine he and his team are already starting to find their stride and i look forward to how good they become as time goes on
television,removed,freedom of speech just means that the government cant come to your door and put you away for saying things they dont like it doesnt mean you can harass others with racistbigotasshole language with impunity twitter is totally within their rights to be like eeeeh maybe we dont to want that kind of behavior slide
television,removed,i think i think this show is dumb and sucks balls
television,removed,out of the top links on rtelevision are netflix all good except netflix isnt television am i the only one that sees that just like youtube isnt television netflix isnt either its a streaming thing it should be a different thing just because something is serial doesnt mean its television we should have a new rule blocking netflix things

television,removed,lol u mad
television,removed,i think theres wiggle room for what creators considers it to be the godfather could be considered a miniseries to some extent given that netflix has fewparts miniseries that ignore tradition time formats too but theyre advertised as movies and series respectively when does a show become a miniseries or vice versa what if a show ends after one season or prior to the end of one season i dont have answers to these questions by the way im just asking them to the wind as far as im concerned words are just weird people sounds we make with our respiratory system and it means whatever we all can convince each other it means

television,removed,oh i agree just like no one made me repeat the story to my friends when i heard it from someone like leno its an upsetting thing to hear and really sticks in your craw to hear someone is making bank scamming someone while youre working your ass off fuck that so once it was stated in just the right way it became its own thing its still mentioned to this day its the go to when talking about frivolous lawsuits the way the facts were contorted to fit a certain narrative definitely makes it suspicious though i could believe that its just a news story that was told well and grew legs either one is possible but there are probably financial records of these places being paid to do this work also even if they did pay people to defame the plaintiff its not illegal its slimy as fuck but not law breaking

television,removed,yep before the episode aired one of the creators posted on his about the situation im here to explain why we ended up having to do one sometime around a year and a half ago we were similarly duped on a large scale we got the news from the higherups that our book budget was getting slashed almost to the tune of an entire episodes budget we had two options let go a significant number of crew members several weeks early or make a clips episode we never considered the first option we werent going to do that to our crew and even if we were callous enough to do so we never would have been able to finish the season without them
television,removed,i think bryan cranstons work on breaking bad far eclipsed malcolm in the middle and that may be why theres not as much talk now kind of like how nobody mentions that tom hanks got his start on bosom buddies
television,removed,alright dick
television,removed,good point
television,removed,rip stranger things
television,removed,good you are sociopaths who rape and murder innocent people from bottom up
television,removed,very upsetting but much more accurate about what really goes on in prison season shed light on stop and frisk black lives matter and other important social injustices i think pousseys death scene was inspired by the death of eric garner i cant breathe would be nice to think that this show could help change the worldeven just a little bit

television,removed,you didnt answer my question
television,removed,who have the critical thinking skills of a child no you are thinking of black people which is why everyone treats their race differently than they do other races
television,removed,
television,removed,agreed separate but equal rules
television,removed,if this is the best thing on netflix im not missing much just typical american noncomedy fare the fetishisation of antiintellectualism is as noticeable in your tv programming as it is in every other aspect of american culture as an outsider looking in its no wonder why your political system is categorised in my mind in the same place as a circus america will fall flat on its face and as a norwegian i will be glad you people deserve the incompetent fascist you have elected vile
television,removed,this was his crossfire moment for me you mean noah will make a black version of tomi lahrens show but have it star larry wilmore also great idea stewart says we need to be less tribalistic and try to understand each other and everyone talks about how noah gangraped this woman as if this isnt more of the same selfsatisfactory nonsense that led to everyone this year thinking hilary would win and then crying themselves all of november when it didnt happen
television,removed,the show is for pussies and crybabies its hilarious that people care what this african comedian thinks

television,removed,what lion lol you dont mean that a whiny african pussy is a lion do you
television,removed,this isnt about me its about fuck trevor noah right back to africa
television,removed,but why he doesnt know anything about america and all he can do is cry about racism and hes clearly having a hard time with the fact that in all his smugness he was totally wrong about this country and its people
television,removed,blm is all about hate for anyone who isnt black they are the worst sort of people fuck all of them they are fucking savage monsters and should be dispersed wherever they gather to protest with the most violent methods at our disposal

television,removed,httpwwwhulkusccomwatchcnbclivestream
television,removed,its just hip to hate it right now it happens
television,removed,thats my point it doesnt apply a cult as the above post indicated actively controls its members neither trump nor hillary did that they just spouted nonsense and a large part of the population was too ignorant or lazy to thinkcheck while the media are definitely not clean that responsibility is entirely on the voters especially with access to the internet you cant just pretend to have been brainwashed and put all the blame on politicians
television,removed,if you liked smallville you have shit taste anyway so im kinda glad the show doesnt appeal to you
television,removed,them residuals though but in all seriousness if you say a show can go for seasons and still be really really compelling then youre a goddamn liar dont use the simpsons as example it got repetitive after seasons
television,removed,i stopped watching after i missed an episode in the first season too lazy to catch up
television,removed,i personally really dislike how unrealistic it is in terms of tactics not only do some zombies make noise you can hear from feet away and then others sneak up on characters in the middle of the woods would be stepping on sticks and loud leaves and bitekill them but why are the characters walking around in jeans and tshirts if the zombies can kill you with a bite and at best their bite strength is that of a healthy living humanwhy arent they wearing protective gear humans cant bite through leather or jean or even in brad pitts character wrapped some magazines around his forearm and taped them there as a armor against zombie bites so why at the very least dont these characters do that to their most biteable areas their forearms their ankles and then wear a top with leatherjean protection on their shoulderneck hell it took how long for the alexandria survivors ricks group to realize they should build platforms with overwatch security positions in alexandria jeez
television,removed,agree but they havent really learned from ad block culture i was fine when south park had a small second ad times per show i can live with that now they have the full might as well be watching cable experience minute ad blocks where many of them just repeat are obnoxious and even if you let them run they force you to reload them if the last ad watched was muted when it finishes fuck that

television,removed,fuck hillary clinton that lying bitch
television,removed,sanders and warren didnt hold her responsible why should we do it on their behalf they played partisan with one of the most corrupt politicians to grace us politics since our countrys inception bernie dug his grave when he listened to the same talking heads and establishment media that tried to suppress him at every turn by buying that trump is a bigot which wikileaks revealed to be a campaign strategy from hillary hillary clinton embodied special interests and the establishment sanders and warren love to talk about how theyre against it but they havent shown that as a former bernie supporter i will never support the progressive movement again so long as bernie sanders and elizabeth warren are involved their words fall on hollow ears
television,removed,itt downvotes for anyone who speaking the truth you guys dont want to except
television,removed,are you dumb
television,removed,why was the deep south and midwest going to vote for a socialist jew bernie would have won the popular and thanks to gerrymandering donnie would have still won the election

television,removed,college will never be free fucking idiot
television,removed,sorry hes economically retarded when he thinks that having a choice of deodorant is a problem then hes either economically infantile or a full blown communist in his mind the government should dictate how many brands of deodorant should be available so we can reallocate money to starving people socialism has a long history of being very cruel to humanity and destructive to the environment so lets go ahead and give bernie all this power im sure hell be the one guy who isnt easily corrupted strange how he bought a beach house right when he endorsed hillary right anyway he may be completely immune to corruption but in years someone else will replace him who might not be i wish people would be more revolutionary toward following our constitution and giving more freedom
television,removed,well dare dick do your feelings really get hurt because someone said something bad about you
television,removed,name one instance where he told his supporters to act violently trump supporters are the ones getting harassed you ignorant child i personally have been a man has had his car stolen and the shit beat out of him because of a god damn sticker
television,removed,nah sorry bernie its our revolution the nationalist revolution not the commies
television,removed,i hate to advocate giving brietbart clicks but you can see for yourself its a gathering place for white nationalists not to mentioned featuring outright sexists headlines like there is no hiring bias against women they suck at interviews and birth control makes women ugly
television,removed,nah sjws are ruining this country but now they have no power

television,removed,no refunds he just trying to make a buck off of gullible liberals dont buy his book bernie sanders is a waste who wants to influence the young and impressionable while in reality he does not have half the nut it takes to stand up for what he preaches guy is a con man in donations and he gave most of it to debbie wasserman schultzs dnc after things got tough and he didnt have the guts to fight for what he preaches he is a socialist con man i repeat do not buy his book bernie is over he sold out to the corrupt establishment he pretended he was fighting a fighter a real revolutionary looks like donald trump where he will fight tooth and nail for you not bend over when things get a little rough for him bernie is a loser and he should be treated as one
television,removed,bernie is a sellout he complains about the in this video yet he endorsed her great standards im also sick of these liberal fucks that sold him down the road bitching because they lost they endorsed the enemy hillary and the dnc america got what she deserved she got grabbed by the pussy deal with it its your fault hillary supporters go suck a corporate dick you ruined america
television,removed,your moms yeast infection takes the cake on that front
television,removed,awwwwwhittle boy is all butt hurt because
television,removed,you have learned nothing
television,removed,happy cake day
television,removed,oh im going to enjoy it sweetheart i am actually going to enjoy watching him destroy the fabric of our sociopolitical system because then it will be ok for people like me to meet people like you not on reddit but in the fucking street you guys are really good at writing shitty memes but how good are you at catching molotov cocktails cause that is where we are heading and i am looking forward to it fascists arent going to stand a fucking chance
television,removed,i think he shouldnt have turned around and told people to vote for the person he spent hundreds of millions of donator dollars telling people how awful they were
television,removed,because politifact is definitely an unbiased source
television,removed,secret gop research that would be used against him if he was the nominee the fact that the msm was comparing trump to hitler on a nightly basis and he still won kind of torpedoes that logic though
television,removed,i was there during the scandal the only jokes i can see her stealing are patrice oneils which was blatant but most of but not all the jokes she allegedly stole from madigan pescatelli and liehman were a bit of a stretch i can see where they were coming from when they accused her of stealing the a coma exercise bit but the slap chef bit and the dressing your man so he doesnt get laid bit were low hanging fruit i cant imagine what her excuse is for blatantly taking patrices sex moves bit and maybe the comainduced workout is a little too outthere to excuse but the whole aspect of plagarism just doesnt work the same way in comedy joke theft is wrong but not every similar joke is joke theft thats what ive been saying from the very very beginning and i dont understand why i have to keep elaborating on it comedy has been around forever so much sot hat the market is convoluted if we were to break down every joke every comedian worth a damn has said wed have a billion joke theft cases a day but alas thats not how joke theft works joke theft is the poltergeistsex or the im an asshole bit not the we dress our men ugly on purpose bullshit
television,removed,i might be old fashioned when i say i care more about talent than diversity if the best writer in the room is black white brown gay straight male female whatever they should have the job this whole diversity for the sake of diversity often ends up being at the cost of good writing examples where its been done well because the talent was good more than anything else and it helped rather than negatively impacted the narrative or story the new star wars jessica jones pacific rim etc
television,removed,well the most important thing is that he will be dead very very soonthankfully
television,removed,i get it i definitely want to be part of the solution but that doesnt mean i should just be like ok racists what youre doing is perfectly fine by me im from the south the shit i hear people say and that ive heard my entire life just makes me fucking sick you think the n word doesnt get thrown around every day people have yelled fag at my husband when hes driven my car because it looks like a chicks car but hearing their cries and giving them their jobs back isnt possible but they cant see that they refuse to understand why its becoming harder to employ uneducated people and they dont want to move forward they want to move backward to the times when you could go to a factory and get a comfortable its extremely frustrating because facts of life continuously fall on deaf ears
television,removed,listen dipshit if you come around here and you come and you think you can talk these numbers just leave man
television,removed,i dont have any problems with your statement except for the assumption that diversity is just about race class for instance not all white guys are from the suburbs my best friend from the military grew up in the burbs and listened to punk and emo and hung out at the skate park before joining up me i grew up in deep poverty with brothers and sisters some of my first memories are my family picking crops i lived all over from the northeast to the deep southwest always in poverty i visited my dad in jail and buried both my parents before i was other than things dealing purely with being black in the burbs putting him in a writers room instead of me only makes a room full of guys from the suburbs more racially diverse not necessarily diverse in viewpoint i mean as a raw metric having more people of color or women or people with different orientations isnt the worst arbitrary qualification if you are going for diversity because there are things theyve probably experienced that i havent but assuming white people are a monolithic mass ignores a lot of peoples experiences too racial diversity and experiential diversity overlap im sure but intersectionality applies to honkeys as well
television,removed,this is a myth claimed to be myth by eichenwald by an article disagreed with by greenwald and adam johnson for starters this isnt some thesis dissertation this is merely an opinion essay by someone who didnt like sanders hes said before sanders has an increasingly unhinged cult and who also voted for multiple bushes hmm yeah sounds like he would never have agreed that sanders would win the primary its a subjective opinion piece and only those that agree with it are going to like it are you unfamiliar with the concessions made on the democratic party platform are you that

television,removed,it was a shit series from the first episode to the last blame the other writers too you stupid fuck
television,removed,and i couldnt care less what you feel about my opinion but hey just for fun you completely disagree that season one was great or that many people like the show spoilers or that the writers fucking promised not to make it all about the p word from the start then did or were you just so focused on being a dick that you forgot those things
television,removed,you fucking goof lol you said i disagree with everything you said which if you were paying attention at all means you disagree with me that the first season was awesome many people like the show and the writers promised it wasnt about the p word then seemingly threw their hands up and said zero fucks when it came time to wrap the show and said the p word so you disagree with all of those things because the first two would make you contradicting yourself and the third well thats just a fact they even went so far as to say it was lazy and unimaginative to have the entire show be about that then they did it before you reply again with that oh so witty u mad angle youre trying to work keep in mind im only pointing out to you how fucking idiotic your initial statement was you cant disagree with everything i wrote because theres shit in there that you agree with pay attention you fucking goof im not mad im just letting you know how dumb you sound when you say everything im smoking a joint im drinking a beer i dont have to be back to work till monday and my gf is on her way over you honestly think i give a fuck what you think about my opinion lol im just laughing at you dumbfuck as are a lot of people if theyve read this far

television,removed,hes a shit comedian and i hope he kills himself
television,removed,that idiot just wanted to play the victim by telling everyone how much he hates obama and isnt he brave
television,removed,wow it sounds alot like survivor
television,removed,well a movie critic about not going to go see a alist movie that will be in most theaters is a rife target to be lambasted on twitter of all places he criticices a critic for not doing thier supposed job and hes the one getting shit for it i get it avgn is a sexist asshole that wont watch a female reboot because reasons but will watch transformers and tear it apart whatever both avgn and all his subs can suck my fat hog they are not even close to being able to see how far above on the ladder patton is from those hack shitbags
television,removed,so l until the what has it been since its cancellation in ya jerkoff
television,removed,didnt i back this on kickstater a few months ago wth are they doing with that hack felicia day

television,removed,because oswalt pissed off the trumpian antisjw hate community on reddit so oswalt is now liberal public enemy and anyone who supports them is also under attack just reality
television,removed,i can understand that more but it still seems kind of silly to me the vast majority of movies are led by men many movies will have a whole bunch of men and then one woman as the primary cast why not change things up in that way for me hearing other men complain about this sort of thing feels kind of like when christians complain about a religious monument being removed from a public park or something youre not being discriminated against just maybe losing a little privilege
television,removed,im saying trailers arent always useful guides if you dont want to watch a movie thats fine but why publish a minute review about how much a movie sucks when youve never seen the movie
television,removed,christ get over your fucking bullshit and stop whining about how youre so fucking oppressed
television,removed,james rolfe was being a manchild and a sexist patton teased him about attacking a movie his late wife worked on without even bothering to cover it meanwhile you fucknuts insulted pattons late wife and photoshopped her picture on to the face of slimer yeah no sympathy for you or your sexist jackass cause
television,removed,he was being a sexist manchild if you werent also one youd see that
television,removed,people were photoshopping her face on to slimer and sending it to patton over twitter you fuckwads are fucking unforgivable
television,removed,youre a fucking idiot patton is a sweetheart
television,removed,not liking patton oswalt is pretty much the perfect tell for me that youre a sexist outside of this recent ghostbusters debacle anyone that has ever met patton oswalt has loved the hell out of him hes a sweetheart
television,removed,if you cant fucking read the subtext of why he even got upset in the first place then youre fucking not paying attention
television,removed,aaaand theres the proof its like clockwork
television,removed,cmon you dont believe that a celeb has the right not to have their home and email address plastered all over thats absurd we can rattle off names of people who had their bank accounts coopted were fired for pretty mundane tweets or had hitpieces written about them just for opposing gamergate say the wrong thing about these guys and even years down the road youll have people whining about you in the comments of message boards every time your name comes up being afraid is silly but watching out for the of ggers who are thinskinned jerks who nurse lifelong grudges seems like a good practice
television,removed,you forgot the part where they took the at birth then tried to tell her mother she miscarried and doctored the records to show that she had a miscarriage
television,removed,from the opening minutes of this show it reminded me of that great series from when i was a kid ill always remember the pod gunner and the sketch book and the big yellow cartoon tire and that indian around the campfire in the opening credits good times good times

television,removed,all been exposed as govt propaganda proof and if youre going to cite the ndaa thing from a few years ago answer these questions did those news sources apparent bias suddenly shift after it was passed or did they already lean in the same direction prior to its passage were there major shifts in employment for those sources immediately following its passage if the government was forcing journalists to say specific things or types of things that would violate the first amendment so they would have had to either replace them with new people or give them some strong incentive that still didnt technically force them to do anything and is it really likely that absolutely no one working for them would have exposed it with proof since then for supposed journalists that would seem to be an amazing exposé in itself would the government really have included a provision that allowed them to use cnn etc as propaganda in a publicly available bill it would have obviously made way more sense to do it secretly through one of the agencies similarly to how a lot of the surveillance stuff was done until it was exposed while ill admit that i havent read the actual wording of the law itself and while without reading it i suppose its possible that it could have been written overbroadly it seems much more likely to me that the purpose of that kind of law was simply to allow certain intelligence tactics to be used on forums that were believed to be mainly frequented by foreigners but which may have us citizens on them as well the agency might not necessarily be able to tell where everyone is from on the other hand if you have some other form of proof and thus dont necessarily need to answer those questions id be interested in seeing it

television,removed,theres an argument to be made for gus fring in breaking bad but lost and prison break are not even close to greatest tv villains at least if you consider content made specifically for tv those guys barely make in the top my top three would be stinger bell and avon barksdale from the wire rowan pope from scandal newman from seinfeld only rowan pope is a character who wasnt there from the beginning of the series season appearance and you cant discount great comedic villains like wiley coyote or tom the cat from tom and jerry if we are talking villains based on outside of tv content you could bring up people who would be in the top like king joffrey or the joker two villains better than any character on lost or prison break
television,removed,seriously bro broke girls isnt that bad kat dennings left boob and kat dennings right boob do exceptional work on the show that needs to be reconciled
television,removed,whats the problem with wanting some quality of life changes netflix has room for improvement and theres nothing wrong with talking about that its not like op is saying this is some major outrage just that its a nice feature that would be appreciated
television,removed,there is not a show that competes to million dollar extreme presents world peace
television,removed,million dollar extreme presents world peace
television,removed,million dollar extreme presents world peace is a good show
television,removed,million dollar extreme presents world peace is definitely a show i like
television,removed,i have watched million dollar extreme presents world peace and i enjoyed it
television,removed,please vote for million dollar extreme presents world peace
television,removed,the best show of the year is million dollar extreme presents world peace
television,removed,vote for million dollar extreme presents world peace
television,removed,huh mei didnt know the song that was courtesan lady oksana
television,removed,because i say so
television,removed,haim saban is that jewish or japanese
television,removed,the black chick in the grey sweatshirt dies at the end
television,removed,
television,removed,from my view he killed her not because he was so disturbed by fucking his own mother but because of where his mother ended up sure he definitely must have been pretty messed up after he knew it was his mum but i think he killed her because he didnt want his mother to live as a whore i imagine up until that point he was treated so well by the khan that he barely thought of his past imagine coming face to face with your own mother at a whore house also the line my family are here inside is pretty disgusting when you find out its his mother haha
television,removed,analysis but then how did mei lin know the tune when she hummed it it triggered his flashback
television,removed,sigh fine you win shes a mensa candidate that has just adopted a ditsy personality for the sake of making herself attractive for all of us knuckle draggers that cant stand intelligent women feel better
television,removed,guy you look nice in that dress girl sexual harassment all your money are belongs to me
television,removed,thats what happens when women routinely cry wolf
television,removed,good fucking pointless dinduremake
television,removed,thats what women do when you threaten to fire them
television,removed,lol
television,removed,at least you embrace your sexism
television,removed,man i bought that game it was a subpar gaming experience when you compare it to something like shadowman first person shooterquest type game on the stark difference in the consistency concept and attention to detail practically shits in your mouth
television,removed,cant find the torrents yet
television,removed,some of the acting where sutherland isnt in the scene is a bit weak basically anything with general jackass he was the weakest part of the episode for me which isnt great news considering hes shaping up to be a major antagonist
television,removed,they are creative geniuses the book of mormon is the best musical i have ever seen fuck you hamilton
television,removed,maybe im to much of a fan but the general is the same guy that played the russian that loaded jack bauer onto the helicopter at the end of the last season spoiler if you havent seen it yet the only thing i could do the entire show was think that this is jack bauers hallucinations while in a russian prison and its going to cut to commercial and return somewhere in russia with that general slapping him in the face also same actor who played gibbs in pirates
television,removed,shekels have been deposited in your account
television,removed,as someone who identifies as an attack helicopter its important to acknowledge that this was brought on by his own terrestrial ambulatory privilege notallattackhelicopters
television,removed,first year cost me cents a month following year im sure it was entered with good intentions but big pharma has more power and here we are

television,removed,yes that is indeed what was said in the video
television,removed,yes that is indeed what was said in the video
television,removed,yes that is indeed what was said in the video
television,removed,your candidate anybody who isnt voting trump must love clinton o i am laffin
television,removed,yes that is indeed what was said in the video
television,removed,yes that is indeed what was said in the video
television,removed,by not meeting the necessary requirements for usc § for clinton to commit a crime under this statute you need lawful possession of classified info gross negligence and removed delivered lost or stolen info she is only guilty if all three exist comey specifically stated that there was no evidence that information was removed from her custody lost stolen abstracted or destroyed that means a crucial element of the crime was never met
television,removed,yeah how else you gonna impress people you dont know
television,removed,or she and huma could fuck your wife for a little more cuckold outreach
television,removed,i know my family and friends better than you know my family and friends me who is gonna take your guns police military that would be me do you really think police and military members would be okay with going around house to house telling you to turn over fire arms brother in law the un has done it before me so the un is going to cross the atlantic and disarm the american public i have a challenge for you ask trump supporters who physically is going to take your guns let me know the results i find the response to that question is the most eye opening in the basic lack of understanding how citizen to government interaction takes place
television,removed,hillary titston might kill zach for this interview rip future zach
television,removed,the country is only going to shit if she wins
television,removed,lol legit question
television,removed,lol someones triggered
television,removed,i started cracking up midsip of coffee while he said that httpsgfycatcomwholehiddenflickertailsquirrel
television,removed,i got the quote
television,removed,dont tell me what i dont understand
television,removed,there would be an immediate constitutional crisis and its hard to imagine it being resolved without at least a little paramilitary conflict lol it happened already in you fucking idiot
television,removed,funny how even spiderman cant help but do kungfu dance moves in this japanese version
television,removed,joking aside looking back as an adult its honestly one of the most unique if not best modern pooh films
television,removed,the balls to go on a scripted show that she already knew what was to be said and had approved it
television,removed,id like to see an effective one
television,removed,le unseen gem
television,removed,has nothing to do with hillary if you believe that were done here you are one naive dude he did it right after a conference call with her i believe
television,removed,seriously you actually have faith that people arent this stupid wow thats big of you i have some discount real estate to sell why dont you pm me your credit card info and ill send you the details
television,removed,
television,removed,im not sure its mentally or physically possible to binge that show
television,removed,why are stupid people stupid because it just is stupid motherfucker
television,removed,these arent even the same types of democrats that we had and most of the voters for hillary clinton were sanctuary cities and most cities are filled with poor immigrants poor families and young adults who depend on gment handouts these policies over crowd the cities and then keep the rest of the land sparse i did not delete my comment you fuck
television,removed,im done w these save the day vote video was the last straw dont watch these cucks
television,removed,youre the reason trump won
television,removed,autisitic screeching
television,removed,neat neither medicine nor biochemistry have anything to do with acting or humor second for your supposed intelligence your reddit post are one sentence replies so is fairly obvious english and expressing yourself are not your strong suit which by the way is the complete opposite of a comedian perhaps you cant see key and peeles humor because you are completely lacking in these areas to sum this all up ill put it in a way your twitter sized brain can understand complete disrespect shove it up your ass
television,removed,you dont have to look very far to find somebody who used to be a huge obama fan but has since been disappointed and let down by his administration i clearly said his remaining supporters for every person you described which is a group im a part of theres another person who believes obama has done no wrong his current approval ratings paint a very different picture than what youre claiming im sure those numbers are inflated due to clinton and trumps unpopularity but obama has gotten a lot more slack than truly he deserves theres not really any ambiguity about whether or not trump has stirred up a cult of personality that hasnt been matched by any american politician in recent history thats just flat out untrue even assuming that obama no longer has a cult of personality in he unarguably did hope and change everywhere obama is going to be the great savior of the country hell look at his popular vote totals compared to trumps how can you argue that trumps cult of personality is clearly bigger than obamas was go ask a trump follower what they think of those gop senators who arent kissing trumps feet theyll tell you that theyre just as bad as the leftist snowflakes theyre the enemy because youre either with trump or youre against him i mean thats great and all but what percentage of trump supporters do you think that is reddit is not even close to representative of the american population assuming every single member of rthedonald is an american citizen who voted for trump thats still not even close of his total votes im fairly certain that gop senators who openly hate trump arent going to base their votes off of trumps most dedicated voters
television,removed,the problem with this argument made by you amongst many others is that you expect people critical of trump and his supporters to to be held to a higher standard than trump and his supporters for no real reason its hypocritical you say you want to avoid cognitive dissonance i say that i am already doing that by poking holes in pro trump arguments i dont want to abuse them but i feel like i must because they completely ignore the longest growth period in american economic history complain about the dearth of jobs in dying industries that deserve to die tbh and then decide to hold the country back by electing an incompetent git who lied and pretended to have bought their jobs back but actually hasnt its not my fault that these people are too fucking stupid for their own good i refuse to baby these children and clean up their mess they fucked up they fucked the country over they fucked themselves over and they are going to have to deal with that these are the same people who cry about safe spaces but need safe spaces and the very same people who invented the pull yourself up by your bootstraps rhetoric so why dont they fucking do that instead of expecting everyone else to solve their problems for them
television,removed,im sure youre a lot of fun at parties but get the fuck out of here with your bullshit comedy rules take your care bare hug box overly sensitive ass to rwholesomememes if you want clean sanitized and safe comedy keep your butt hurt censorship to yourself and use a wet wipe on your sore vagina
television,removed,tv like this is how you get young people to kidnap and torture someone who trusted them
television,removed,this is funny because they said trump will make america hate again but its anti trumpers who kidnap people and torture them
television,removed,found the pedo
television,removed,you are mentally handicapped but dont worry i wont kidnap and torture you for it
television,removed,i thought that sub was a parody sub at first i didnt think anywhere that ridiculous took itself seriously i was banned for simply posting is this a parody sub in one of the threads it was then i knew they were serious and they were actual crazies
television,removed,ugh nothing worse then immigrants who try to close the door behind them those illegal immigrants are craftier more creative more capitalistic in essence more american than your wife could ever hope to be america is a country about cheating the system and screwing your fellow man to put yourself on top trump embodies those ideals too hes a dog eat dog kinda guy you guys were too weak to beat the immigrants with capitalistic skill so you stood behind trump like a little bitch
television,removed,black terrorist that support the shit that happened in chicago these guys deserve to be executed for treason fascist fucks
television,removed,not a trump supporter some jobs were automated because of a combination of the government allowing businesses to expense capital assets the cost of insurance eg workers comp health and the regulation headaches associated with having employees dialing back regulations should make it easier to hire people
television,removed,you call out trump as a cult of personality but not obama that means your full of shit and nobody wants to walk to someone like that the first black president didnt have a cult like following in your mind thats hilarious
television,removed,im confused on your statement im pretty sure you are saying the automation happened because the government allowed businesses to expense more of the costs of having employees no i said expense capital assets expensing allows a company to deduct asset depreciation much sooner than otherwise allowed ie a tax break on robots which regulations are you thinking might be removed though there are some specific rules but the obama administration fostered uncertainty in the marketplace restoring that certainty is more important lets just look at the overtime reg thats being challenged this reg changed who qualifies as an exempt employee many insurance policies are classes out so that exempt and nonexempt prior receive different benefits adjusting policies and helping insurance companies get the info they need requires manhours ie money many businesses cant afford the overtime so they had to cut hours and hire more people at small hours and guess what the reg never became effective because a judge put an injunction in place because the rule like so many other obama regs pushed executive power too far other jobkilling lawsregs dol advisory opinion auto iras ppaca hour requirement
television,removed,my biggest complaints are with secretary perez and the dol your epa thing is good for nothing but cheap political points most every day people that hate the epa think that big businesses are treated different by the epa than the little guys they are so can you put the straw man to bed
television,removed,she gives a good blowie
television,removed,were not in a political subreddit you dumbass
television,removed,its kind of fun and is also insanely darklike wtf just happened at times great music and cinematography
television,removed,yeah theres also anarchism straight up tankie fucks communism shitredditsays gamerghazi subredditdrama lgbt not rainbow though theyre awesome and others that are generally safe spaces for the opposite type of shithead ukalarianreborn is right the entire point of this site is to set up moderated safe spaces for whatever interest exists

television,removed,
television,removed,original here
television,removed,classic deflection
television,removed,youre supporting spammer dont you know about spammers they are working from the start of reddit the uploader uploaded year old video after its two year of upload he also cuts the video to upload in his channel why are you supporting him
television,removed,original here
television,removed,no it would not have you in your entire life ever seen a politican ever lose their career over anything we have crack smoking mayors who still get elected
television,removed,tho actually i think the worse one was when that genetics sorcerer guy took over a peacekeeper leviathan and cloned the peacekeeper soldiers so many times that they were reduced to rapey cavepeople who survived aboard the ships corpse and by eating its rottingyet alive remains many nightmares
television,removed,wasnt my point at all but we you really are a condescending douchebag
television,removed,this way of thinking somewhat bothers me as it seems youre implying that were living in an era of feminist positivity thats not the case this sort of vibe ive gotten from browsing mens rights subsa sense of bitterness and belief that women are somehow respected and listened to and in a golden age of equalityit rubs me the wrong way women get to do absolutely whatever they want not just socially but legally they have vanishingly smaller chances of being arrested and again vanishingly smaller chances of being sentenced and again vanishingly smaller sentences for the same crimes
television,removed,its honestly disgusting how few women are in the stem field no its not because thats a choice women made the focus on stem is what is truly disgusting why do feminists push for stem because of money theres no movement to get women into garbage collecting or factory work its selfserving
television,removed,if the mrm wants to be taken seriously it needs to talk about helping men instead of how feminism is a cancer or how feminism should be helping men why not both feminists actively seek to bar advancement they are a hurdle
television,removed,spike and tara from buffy the vampire slayer dr hibbert from the simpsons the tardis from doctor who

television,removed,oh shoot made a common grammar mistake okay fixed it also youre kind of an annoying dude ya know that

television,removed,king of queens lol
television,removed,most people that are big enough fans to read theories online maybe
television,removed,smoke
television,removed,yes fuck that guy
television,removed,not sure manmy other comment was completely trashed ha i guess folks disagree must be young kids who cant discern the nuances between classic rock and metal id say it starts with the key the music is played in classic rock is generally played on a blues scale like classic stones zeppelin etc and has a much more raw unpolished sound while metal is played in whatever key power chords are played on and has a much more synth soundpower metal specifically is generally more upbeat and has clear vocalizations i worship jareth the goblin king
television,removed,sorry bud but yeah this is definitely power metal fits the genre to a t
television,removed,remindme weeks
television,removed,the republicans would have been the favourites to win the presidency this year based on precedent its not a coincidence that a lot of democrats wanted someone like trump to be the nominee to tip the balance back in their favor i think some of the email leaks showed the dems actively working to make trump nominee
television,removed,i literally said i think but ok keep arguing the opposite because i literally havent written a phd thesis on this situation
television,removed,i just feel like the millennials dont really care about sports like the generation before myself included i like sports they are fun to watch like soccer football nascar formula and extreme sports like snowboarding and skateboarding but id rather do many other things than watch the sport id rather go snowboarding hiking or watch a new episode of my favorite series play a video game i rarely watch sports i dont even have cable television haha not interested in reality shows
television,removed,i hope you were joking if you were it was funny if not it was not funny in the most redneck retarded way
television,removed,because the content they are putting on tv is hothotgaaarbage
television,removed,ive stopped doing just about everything because of the commercials i go to youtube instead of spotify i dont watch broadcast television i dont listen to the radio i dont read magazines i dont attend movies in the theater i mute my volume and look away when there are unavoidable commercials
television,removed,i just want streaming sports like unlimited baseball basketball football id pay a month to stream that i think the market for stay home alone nerds who want to watch sports is way undervalued but thats just my opinion
television,removed,gilmore girls has four seasons of it although it ends up being requited after that
television,removed,rcirclejerk
television,removed,just like the late night comedians this is what happens when you hijack every station to push leftwing propaganda down everyones throats
television,removed,the contract actual started in so its seasons not
television,removed,my take on the the friends from friends were terrible people argument is it was a sitcom it was funny so who cares
television,removed,
television,removed,i hate the patriots but the relentless biased coverage of espn against brady and belichick while wife beaters were given a fraction of the coverage especially given the overwhelming evidence that goodell was on a witch hunt against ne rubbed just about everybody the wrong way and i say this as a broncos fan anyone with half a brain sees a direct correlation between deflategate and the fall of espn and the nfl look at where their core audience and hq is the northeast look at the powerhouse fanbases there ny and boston you rub either of those fanbases wrong your business is fucked not to mention they cut hockey big mistake they do too much fluff and not enough highlights and they havent had the nhl espn theme in forever and that was the greatest sports show song of them all im happy to see nfl and espn fall together this is what happens when good journalism and a commitment to audience happiness turns into political moves based on satisfying billionaire stakeholders

television,removed,i loved the show watched it on the bbc when it run and it was great bit of a shame it wasnt succsessful my favourit part was when strange gets tricked to swap his wife for a piece of wood very cool atmosphere to the whole part
television,removed,sees the downvotes for offering up spoilers still decides to post dude you are a dick the downvoters are trying to tell you the same thing the commenters are stop talking about events that happen in a show that most of this thread hasnt seen
television,removed,savour it
television,removed,interestingly these were the two comedies that won the competition one note from that article of those finalists two winners will have their shows broadcast on nbc with an initial order of up to four episodes not including the pilot clearly the initial order thing didnt happen but maybe per the competition rules nbc is contractually obligated to air both of these pilots really sticking them in the worst possible time slot so it wouldnt surprise me
television,removed,yes was barb was eaten by a monster spoiler alert
television,removed,i wouldnt be surprised if theyre planning to do it eventually they probably got rid of the episode numbering the force awakens technically wasnt called episode vii because they figured that theyd do earlier prequels at some point and didnt want to have to change the numbers again
television,removed,fuck off

television,removed,i cannot wait for trump to win so all of you beta male hipsters and third wave feminists rip your assholes out and throw them against the wall
television,removed,i cba to watch it as im taking the advice anyway but its decent advice if its anything like the first two series then itll be a bit mindfucky and youll get less out of it by steaming through and not considering things a little unless youre super smart and also incredibly emotionally evolved where you can process things really fast but if thats the case then get the fuck off reddit and do something useful
television,removed,lol
television,removed,i was the woman who spun first to get the the contestant that did the crazy freak out dance yes i knew i was on national tv but i was having too much fun to contain myself i was also very excited for my interview and probably why i got on i watched price is right for years when i worked nights i dont think preinterviews are unfair its tv the producer who i learned after the show who helps choose the contestants has been doing this job for yrs are looking for fun people who are happy to be there i was very excited and sincere in my excitement to be finally at the price is right i think some fakes get though im sure it happens we are all actors in some way to get what we want but as my friend told me after i was a little embarrassed for being a little overthetop he said you made for good tv and again i was just happy i made it and then even got a little dental work paid off no one remembers boring and normal is rarely fun
television,removed,but it was the first time that all three spun two times to get a combination of a dollar the other times contestants have spun on their first spins im told this is why it was so rare i was the first contestant the really crazy one
television,removed,hank mardukis in love you man

television,removed,besides setting the stage for what is coming which is definitely a good quality a good cliffhanger has a couple more one is an element of surprise the other is credibility it is something that is perfectly possible and realistic but that you could not foresee until it is revealed your breaking bad example does that perfectly plausible yet unexpected the walking dead example doesnt have either oh the bad man is bad and still bad and continues to be bad and he will do something bad to make the group respect him which isnt realistic either so no surprise and no credibility
television,removed,thats not the office
television,removed,ok
television,removed,i just assumed he was actually dead then when people asked them if he was actually alive kirkman and the producers were all like oh of course hes dead or no of course hes dead so then if he wasnt dead theyd be cunts for blatantly spoiling it and if he was dead theyd be cunts for acting like he might not be idiotic i also didnt really mind the season cliffhanger but its just common knowledge now on social media who negan killed why the fuck is it so hard for them to keep the lid on this shit i knew about tyreeses death november before he died in february due to a single fucking youtube comment bizarre but yeah overall love the show cant wait for season lol xxxxxx

television,removed,yes my praise have been answered
television,removed,its pretty popularizing depending on your age i find a lot of older black people dont like it personally i loved it i got really stoned one day while watching it and realized just how well each character personifies a stereotype of the black community you a black nationalist the modern thug the senior two variations of selfhating black man the biracial girl with a white mother who doesnt know how to do her hair and gay man whos hiding his sexuality its a funny and intelligent show with surprisingly good action scenes

television,removed,as long as youre white and christian or from a christian nation theyre ok with it its xenophobia it must feel nice to pretend everyone with a different opinion than you is some kind of racist labeling people like this is a big part of the reason the democrats have zero political power for the foreseeable future how about people who you know dont want to have gays put to death how about people who let women drive cars and dont whip them as punishment for getting raped how about people who arent going to mutilate their daughters with a razor blade because they think women shouldnt enjoy sex how about people who dont support honor killings or sharia law how about people who dont think death is an appropriate punishment for leaving their religion all cultures are not equal pretending they are is a slap in the face to people who are victimized by muslims islam is a sickeningly violent and hate filled ideology that is completely and totally the antithesis of the american values or tolerance and freedom that liberals pretend to support the fact that liberals are somehow convinced that muslims are really secret liberals is the mystery of the century and is going to continue to crush their chances at winning elections for the foreseeable future

television,removed,the woman is so even if she still does a few of these specials she wont live forever theres no indication of ill health but we all get cancelled at a certain age im surprised shes bothered to work this long but she has the connections as a well respected broadcast journalist to keep going for another years if you were a tree what kind of tree would you be is often quoted from an interview with katharine hepburn but it was more of a discussion not a direct question as quoted id love it if someone like her could keep working forever but i think well see less and less of her in the coming years as she silently slips out the back door of the studio

television,removed,i am really glad that chester got a mention his part in stork patrol has always been a favorite of mine two other bits that could have been mentioned sarah chalke scrubs costarred in the bu and part of the show was filmed on the scrubs set kiefer sutherland once interrupted the lonely island during filming because he thought they were attacking someone
television,removed,i only got how dissapointing

television,removed,d
television,removed,sorry dude there is no cleganebowl this season no trial by combat cersei doesnt go through with it she just has the mountain slaughter everyone instead and then burns down the holy building
television,removed,lots of cunts
television,removed,probably stretched out from all the rape
television,removed,perhaps you should know that tommen kills himself by jumping out of the window of the red keep as confirmed by a got insider
television,removed,nothing uncivil about it you are clearly selfcentered and you need to get over yourself
television,removed,cleganebowl isnt happening this season the trailers for the next episode even show zombieclegane mauling a bunch of sparrows this will obviously forfeit the trial by combat there have been numerous leaks that confirm this tommen commits suicide thats going to be interesting sad end for him i thought hes just young and needs some time to become a better ruler but the events seem to have gone completely over his head cercei prophecy confirmed
television,removed,i am a big fan i think its funny and dramatic it is showing women of our generation growing into adulthood and i can relate to hannah because her anxiety and her writing

television,removed,that show lost me when they killed kate maras character i thought the first was fun as hell and then it just became this mass of boring uninspired crap they just now brought back the journalism subplot but its too little too late and the year old news editor guy doesnt carry the same excitement that kate mara and the huffpostlike lady did
television,removed,idk if that would really happen mate
television,removed,tad overblown bud take a break from tia alright go get a sandwich or something and cool off
television,removed,take a quick break from tia and cool off buddy go get a nice hot cup of tea
television,removed,after a show airs you cant reasonably complain about spoilers you can maybe have a one day grace period but its totally unreasonable to not watch a show and then get mad about a magazine cover a week later if you care about being unspoiled then part of it is on you to keep up with plot developments you cant just be lazy and expect the world to stop my wife is a fan of both got and westworld but as we dont have cable and work she normally waits until monday to watch them online because they air on sundays but that means that on monday she has to make a deliberate effort to avoid tv sites and related subreddits during the day
television,removed,ive heard the consensus be something like a month for an episode six months for a season and two years after an entire show has aired its series finale those are obviously just common courtesy type things about loudly speaking about it in a lunchroom or office or something if im with a group of people talking about something we usually just ask before we start talking about something but its tough these days with so many at minimum decent shows airing and people having the ability to watch all sorts of stuff at their own pace plus you cant forget shows like breaking bad the sopranos lost etc that people never watched the first time and are catching now but then again if i hear people talking about something i havent seen i usually just try to excuse myself instead of stifling their conversation
television,removed,how about you try something new in your life and educate yourself if you should be sick of anyone it should be of yourself
television,removed,we get it you vape
television,removed,at the same time people should avoid just blatantly spoiling things like character deaths in threads that dont have anything to do with that show theres nothing in the thread title about twd spoilers being comments deep
television,removed,i knew the twist and i still loved that movie i think its worth watching
television,removed,mirror
television,removed,seriously it is australia we have fucking vpns you cunts just tired or turning off and on when i click a link i want to see the content
television,removed,theres tons of options go to your local university and protest by holding signs that mentions an unfair shooting that happened report it to the local news station if it happens in your area get a paper published in your local newspaper and post about it on your favorite media site like vox or medium share it on your twitter and facebook once youve gained traction you can probably start getting opeds in more notable newspapers and then you can try to rationally describe your problems and hopefully come up with actionable laws that can be passed a great example is body cams on all police offers because everyone regardless of skin color should feel safer

television,removed,the ioc blatantly violated its charter this season the ioc takes all necessary steps in order to ensure the fullest coverage by the different media and the widest possible audience in the world for the olympic games so does the crappy coverage by nbc and the massive number of dmca takedown requests satisfy that i dont think so

television,removed,you seem to have a lack of understanding of what being empathetic is how and actually experiencing a form of discrimination based on who you are and your basing that off what exactly those things are entirely different you dont know what empathy is youre thinking sympathy one is putting yourself in someones shoes for a day the other is taking off your shoes and still being that person nah see above and you dont need to be somebody to write about them so now youre just rambling as a white person i try very hard to understand and to listen to the issues that black americans are facing for example and even though i listen and im empathetic and i try to be an ally as best i can i will never know what its like to be black like i said you have low eq just come to terms worth it no amount of emotional intelligence will change that it will actually your wrong sorry we could find common issues that we deal with but for me it will never be because of the color of my skin only people with low eq need to have lived similar experiences to empathize with someone thats what ive been saying seriously educate yourself it must be quite an experience to have an eq thats so high that you can literally tell every minority and marginalized group that you really understand what its like nice straw man fallacy it doesnt matter if i have high eq fact is yours is low

television,removed,uh huh and the fact that so many of the highest paid stars are jewish is just a coincidence right admit that jews prefer hiring other jews or youre a pathetic coward
television,removed,all things considered equal white men will hire white men thus not letting there be a fair and balanced playing field to allow to hire good female or black or asian directors or actors etc etc holy generalization batman get off your high horse neckbeard people in general arent out there living their lives for no other person than to discriminate against you

television,removed,all writer should aspire to write stuff like justified i recall an interview with margo martindale when she kept trying to talk about how good the writing was and the vapid brain dead host kept interrupting her or changing the topic
television,removed,ebitda or adjusted ebitda each as defined below should not be construed as a substitute for net income loss or as a better measure of liquidity than cash flow from operating activities determined in accordance with us gaap ebitda and adjusted ebitda exclude components that are significant in understanding and assessing our results of operations and cash flows ebitda or adjusted ebitda does not represent funds available for managements discretionary use and is not intended to represent cash flow from operations in addition ebitda and adjusted ebitda are not terms defined by gaap and as a result our measure of ebitda and adjusted ebitda might not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies in my case the opposite is happening they pick and choose different assets or hide the profit in the management discretionary use so we dont get our bonus
television,removed,that is a load of shit though using an employment contract to create a backdoor noncompete is still a noncompete the contract is between fox and the employees and it will outline how either side can break it no way is the contract written so either side cannot break it the employees quit and forfeit whatever the contract says they forfeit this has nothing to do with netflix

television,removed,netflix hired marcos waltenberg some kind of spanishjewish version of mark wahlberg
television,removed,my thoughts exactly season one enchanted me with the potential the show had with a good premise including tech themes mental issues etc contentwise i got bored about halfway through but i still had faith in the second season i wanted to see the fallout from the hack season has been awesome the twists and turns are unexpected especially since i dont delve too deep into the mr robot sub where people are always theorizing and surprisingly have been correct had i heard of the prison theory at the time many sub members had figured it out i would not have enjoyed the big reveal and probably the season after that and thats how it should be since this show is already so confusing at it is season two is amazing i dont know what the people who were disappointed with this season were expecting that this season so far has not lived up to their expectations
television,removed,so you can ask him to commit suicide too
television,removed,negrosis will not prevail

television,removed,i voted democrat for almost every election since i was i felt voting was important and i drag my wife to the polls im pretty jaded this round most of the democrats i know are pretty much ignoring all of the shady stuff the dnc and hillary has done i was thinking about voting for my locals and abstaining from potus had some conversations on here and irl recently and ive decided to vote against hillary i dislike trump i cant vote for hillary and the corruption train she is captain of i think a trump presidency will be a wake up call for this country if he wins its the dnc dws and hrc to thank hes the hero this country deserves i just want to see this bus drive off the cliff at this point
television,removed,hey worlds most obvious skill you ignored the word current how the fuck were you upvoted for something that stupid and how much did putin pay per each
television,removed,rpolitics reads like a democrat version of the donald subreddit lolexcept most of their claims are substantiated thats crazy mani didnt realize reddit would let a main sub like that be bought outthen again they did filter the donald trump sub off of rall so
television,removed,but trump supporters are crazy racist sexist conspiracy theorists for thinking this whole thing is being rigged and hillary and the dems are dirty as hell and must be kept from seizing total power bernie supporters can never again raise their heads after you people endorsed her knowing full well the dnc rigged it against him you have no pride anymore only shame but go ahead and destroy the country by electing her lets see how it goes having a corrupt and unethical personparty who will do anything for power and money actively subvert and corrupt the government and all the countries institutions to keep the scandal and crime covered up remember she will be a president under current criminal investigations it will be a constitutional crisis very likely some sort of conflict will come from this
television,removed,lol speaking about pending court cases usa today at least of the lawsuits involving trump and his businesses remain open ny times trump university a series of seminars held in hotels faces three pending lawsuits alleging misrepresentation cnn trump foundation under investigation in new york the guardian trump lawyers ordered to appear in court for allegations trump raped girl washingtonian restaurant lawsuit over trumps racist comments still isnt settled slate lawsuit from trump golf club worker over antigay harassment is in courtmandated mediation yahoo news us intelligence officials are examining ties between trump advisor and kremlin
television,removed,whoever votes for her is to be beaten to death the minute she finishes ruining the country
television,removed,i love how you completely ignore the content of my post and go into a rant about off the record interviews that have nothing to do with blatant journalistic integrity like giving her the veto power over whether they can run a story or not not to mention giving her questions to the debate and why am i not surprised to see your post history dominated by renoughtrumpspam i guess were all just clueless jerks to question hillary
television,removed,what i see it all the time on here basically if its not in rpolitics itll get upvoted by the trump brigade
television,removed,i guess hillary was right when she said she was prepared lmao
television,removed,fuck her all to death
television,removed,from clintons behavior she has no respect for the electorate she insulted sanders supporters and trump supporters her leaked speeches and emails show she will lie to the country and sell it behind closed doors she barely even cares for the charade her husband has a long list of sexual harassment she helped him cover up which in my book makes her just as bad the dnc was manipulated to help her and she hired the stooge that was the face of it the same day she resigned she could have taken the high road at the debates which with all of her experience she should have instead she broke out some middle school garbage that trump called a beauty queen fat with all the email leaks shes willing to throw everyone under the bus and take zero responsibility for it instead of focusing on the leaks she shifted blame to a foreign government that was recently discovered did not have any involvement in hacking the information involving foreign governments in your own incompetence is not the sign of a leader i dont think she is good for the unity of this country im sick of people telling me i have to vote for her sanders would have crushed trump instead the dnc and hillary made this happen i take no responsibility hillary only respects her donors not this country if she does win shell probably get impeached for some scandal or another
television,removed,the corporate world is vague but yeah mentioning that kind of stuff will make you sound crazy it always sounds crazy before its commonly known as true
television,removed,literally paid hillary shills just like the real life agentprovocateurs she paid along with george soros to disrupt trump rallies while having the media arm pin the blame on bernie supporters in order to create a crossfight between the two
television,removed,go ahead and vote for a racist sexist pig like trump moron
television,removed,at a time when we need open conversation than ever i agree unfortunately outside of rpolitics i find that as someone who doesnt think clinton is the literal devil i just get downvoted constantly so its not really any better imo
television,removed,haha thedonald must be so proud that theyve put their voice on a real thread outside of the regard gathering youre not fooling anybody kids
television,removed,when we drain the swamp you can thank us later
television,removed,you realise that the article you linked directly contradicts everything you just said right were you hoping no one would read it every video this guy has ever put out has been exposed to be extremely misleading to the point of being false they dont even report on his stuff now because of his reputation of lies
television,removed,the only reason they didnt say it was faked is because they dont have the unedited footage but i believe at least one of the guys videoed said it was fake and considering every video this guy makes is fake why would anyone even entertain his latest
television,removed,fucking link me some reports then to whatever you think is relevant then and ill learn my self up to be as ignorant as you not kidding send me some fucking reading material dick bag
television,removed,doe voted for logic
television,removed,dude i get it i am really frustrated with this whole thing this election year suck at every turn i dont want either of these people to win i dont want trump to be president im not ignoring anything he did i keep seeing all the dumb shit from both of them i dont want to vote for him i feel the same way about him i do clinton she has been a major part of this whole debacle almost anyone else would have easily trounced on trump ive always been excited to vote the best thing might be for me to stay home this election is one shitty ride
television,removed,the problem is not trump or hilary left or right its white white whtie corrupt the the core asian americans
television,removed,crooked hillary
television,removed,democracy depends on people playing fair its sort of written in the rulebook you belligerent fuck
television,removed,better start counting crowds and throw out actual votes then lewl silly uninformed emotionalist edgelord
television,removed,the fact is america knew bernie is a horrible candidate that would have turned this country into fucking venezuela causing our economy to collapse we prefer this country to be rich and wealthy which is why americans overwhelmingly voted for hillary over bernie a good way to be poor is to do what poor unemployed losers do such as voting for bernie sanders
television,removed,the entire point of debate is to belittle other peoples opinions this is the problem with this thread that people dont realize they dont know that debate is about winning instead of playing fair and equal
television,removed,if youre wondering why some bernie supporters arent as outraged as you might expect about the dnc scandal heres my reason ive been disappointed at the dnc since bush left office it was tough to realize that what seemed like farright politics under bush remember when democrats were pushing the wiretapping scandal was mostly just the way both parties see the world and unfortunately also the way most americans see the world the democratic party doesnt share my views and i never really thought that would chance through an unprecedented primary upset whoever gets a presidential nomination either party really is going to disappoint me with their unconditional support for israel their neoliberal trade policies and their support for government invasion of privacy whoever gets the democratic nomination is going to gain my support through their lukewarm expansion of social policies compared to drastically reducing what i sea as already meager support for them currently and their eversoslightly less hawkish foreign policy it just doesnt make that big a difference to me that they were elected through cronyism and political trickery rather than through the complacency of the voters
television,removed,got news for ya you entitled whiny little pussy it was the same for us and every generation before us stop buying into your professors propaganda and fucking fix shit instead of whining like little fucking babys
television,removed,so the fuck what i mean honestly at this point so what trump is not qualified to lead anything and with clinton being the only other real option that can win then so fucking what some of you pretentious and arrogant little teenagers need to pull your heads out of your asses downvote away you bunch of little hipster pussies

television,removed,sanders pandered to college students exactly the kind of people that predominantly use reddit he had little support outside of that either way it was obvious he was a ploy candidate clinton is literally everything he supposedly wanted to move away from but he couldnt even wait a single day to endorse her and tell all the college kids who donated money for his audi to vote for clinton
television,removed,yeah since they were banned at the time of their banning it was memes if rcirclejerk made the front page every five minutes people would get sick of that too

television,removed,there was once a time where people like you got gassed
television,removed,reddit is actually kind of a crappy place to discuss anything that involves a larger organization such as a major political partys presidential candidate very easy to game reddit using sock puppets and bots ctr and clintondemocrat loyalists dominate rpolitics atm while donald fans and various other groups that want to see him win dominate rthedonald and sometimes other comments in other subreddits depending on the story
television,removed,you dont have to prove intent you fuck you just have to prove negligence which is why the fbi spliced words and didnt call her actions negligent but extreme carelessness youre a joke

television,removed,yeah im sure it was the antialton brown lobby out there to slander his character but i pointed out that the submission was only one report others have said that brown is a bit anal retentive and an evangelical but that they havent had that degree of problems so to take it for what its worth albeit with a less aggressive bent frankly the racial thing came off as a weird misguided comment i wouldnt read too much into it as for disparaging gay marriage brown is a conservative evangelical so its to be expected i just dont have to support someone who was shitting on gay rights when they were still fighting for that particular one
television,removed,yawn are you even trying at this point
television,removed,youre a user of the propaganda subreddit thedonald and you want to lecture other people about how bad this subreddit is of course your response is that im a ctr shill but in reality im just a dumb something who cannot fucking believe you are so hypocritical

television,removed,because this is a fanboy sub people arent here to have a critical conversation theyre here to celebrate shows personally i thought fringe was tacky and silly half the time its not great tv and its really hard to watch especially with walters sons limited acting abilities it wasnt some misunderstood genius show it was just okay with moments of brilliance it got a fairly long production run which frankly ran too long money that could have been spent on a new scifi series that wasnt an xfiles retread
television,removed,ebdita givs me nightmares a bigger company bought the one im working for they changed to this model and never gotten a bonus since its easy to fudge the numbers and its hard to fairly standardize it across different businesses
television,removed,ill add a retro one since lost and the wire have already been mentioned millennium the lessremembered show from the xfiles team for the first dozen episodes it was set up a standard police procedural super bleak and rainy with some xfilesy vibes but still a standard police procedural where the hero is an observant cop and every week he solves a new case and saves the day this is in the too on fox so you know what to expect then halfway through a season with no promotion or buildup the killer of the week disembowels one of the protagonist cops flees and is never caught or identified over the course of the series the episode ends with the characters in despair the hero admitting to ptsd and suicidal thoughts and nothing is ever resolved the bad guy won the end everyone go home that was pretty fucking crazy and gutsy to see on a major broadcast network police procedural at the time
television,removed,thats correct notice how the tone of changed drastically and basically went to shit

television,removed,a conservative didnt win trump did either he played yall for suckers or you gave up your ideals for convenience the third option is you were never really conservative to begin with just a walking meme regurgitator stuffed to the gills with other peoples malformed ideas
television,removed,because mccormick is will he played him back in the when nobody cared enough about an actors sexuality especially a straight actor playing a gay one he was cast in the role because the network thought he was more accessible than hiring an actual gay lead nbc completely cared about his sexuality and that he was a heterosexual they turned the only real gay man on the show into a gay cliche who loves musicals and bottoming for rando latino twinks
television,removed,considering there were only plaintiffs and trump produced around students yes it is significant you are missing my point on the judge the judge was a member of la reza a latino group base entirely on racial lines this is a direct conflict of interest and gives him a bias against trump he didnt admit any guilt this was the terms of the settlement trump would have fought tooth and nail if he wasnt running for president his past lawsuits have proven this he rarely backs down which is why he is a great role model for kids plus his conservative ideals he doesnt smoke or drink

television,removed,is not about dead animals peters fatherly intentions his apparent detachment from time as shown by his lack of reaction to the irritating length of the process are contrasted with a striking sense of down to earth realism shown by the dead animal and its flaccid texture the annoyance of gravity even the sometimes unfavorable mechanical properties of boxes while futile and childish its a very relatable tantrum against the inconvenient and often cruel limits reality impose over our sense of self determination that we tend to take for granted and quietly accept as a given a big fuck you to the physical world we all hold in our hearts for all the times it frustrated our will

television,removed,your computer and your phone are unconscious objects without an awareness it makes no sense to sympathize with them the episode made the point that these cookies are programs yes but they are also aware they dont just simulate behavior they literally feel like the person they were extracted out of theyre basically a copy of their consciousness i think the viewer isnt supposed to ask themselves whether these programs are truly conscious or not they are thats a premise of the episode but rather do we have to treat these beings like we treat each other or does the fact that we artificially created them make that unnecessary
television,removed,it really depends on what you like i started watching it and found the show to be overrated and pretty stupid yet my brother loved it and watched it about twice give it a try watch the first few episodes then decide for yourself you and only you can tell if you like something or not i found a lot of movies tv shows and video games that most people hated enjoyable and good for example the horror movie chernobyl diaries it was hated and recieved really badly yet for me its my favourite horror movie so far
television,removed,a little more dignity for five seasons the wire depicts the projects as a place where anyone in the game can get got even a legend like omar who in all his westernmanwithnoname badassery is still just a nigga with a gun as marlo puts it his abrupt end is fitting in how unfitting it is deserve had nothin to with it thats the message of the wire

television,removed,heres the report thanks for linking it there is no way that can ascertain how many delegates would of gone to sanders they are assuming they know how people would of voted law is not based on assumption they are claiming that the new york people purged all would of voted for sanders there is a huge problem with that not all of those voters would of voted and the statistics on those voters already released was that a majority of them were nonwhite and over the age of which is more clinton than sanders demographics they also said in arizona again sanders voters were effected in maricopa rather than clintons but her lead there was very high and also it is a high nonwhite area again we know sanders did not do well with nonwhite i am not saying that there was not issues anywhere in the country but lawyers normally do not release statements and full fledged reports about their case prior to discovery if it gets that far i believe this entire thing is highly suspect and just feeding fuel to the fire just because they say fraud happened does not make it so feels over reals doesnt make it true

television,removed,do you ever get tired of being an ignorant cunt
television,removed,us has a major problem the problem is that they have a candidate that the media feels comfortable quite literally saying fuck that guy how can one of if not the most prestigeous office in the country be inhabited by someone that is respected by so few unfortunately the other major candidate is not far behind no matter what happens half the country is going to have no respect for your leader never a good thing

television,removed,where can you binge watch it a friend wants to know
television,removed,are you intentionally being naive you readily admit to the collusion going on and yet can say with absolute certainty that john oliver exclusively attacks trump because he hates trump and the numerous scandals arent a big deal without getting into how wrong your analysis of the importance of the numerous scandals is you need to understand that john oliver works for hbo hbo stands to make a lot of money from clintons prohollywood trade policies why would they let him do segments that would effortlessly destroy clinton for all his fickle viewers to soak up seriously wtf is it with democrats and casually dismissing any controversy no matter how great cover me in tin foil but id say you and a large portion of the cunt rags who up voted this are paid for

television,removed,fuck that guy
television,removed,good shilling technique criticize just enough then sell the point i wonder why that is its certainly not likely that the numbers are dropping this episode is absolute shit especially if you are a huge book lover it takes a dump on all of iron islands it takes a dump on most of the history of ancient westeros weve read about and it takes a narrative dump on our beloved hero somehow i am really not convinced martin would come up with something as brilliant it doesnt even make sense as most of brans adventures in greenseerland didnt so far ozymandias had great writing this episode was a steaming pile of shit on level with the walking dead there have been many more and better episodes in the series mostly with story and dialogue taken from or based more faithfully on the novels to take this prize this episode was written by a fifteenyear old but go on downvote me like a good shill should
television,removed,ive watched it hodor hoooodor
television,removed,obviously you arent that desperate and therefore what you would or would not say doesnt really matter this is the most unintelligent comment on this entire thread and that is saying something because someone hasnt been in the exact situation being discussed their opinion is invalid ive never flown a plane into a skyscraper but i dont need to experience it first hand to know thats a bad idea if the womans body image issues were that desperate she wouldve done something about it years ago she saw a chance to make a quick buck and obviously eating enough to gain pounds was no big imposition the fact that you cant grasp this makes me feel more sorry for you than i do for this woman
television,removed,i havent had a chance to watch it again but on my first watch i loved it i loved the arya part the other arya part i loved the discussion about northern houses i loved the grittyness of the iron born scenes although i wish it went on longer i cant explain why with spoilers but if youve read the books you probably know and i thought everything involving bran was great it settled a lot of theories as well maybe that made me think it was better than it is

television,removed,i think black people are currently the socialist boogey man a self described socialist should have won the democratic nomination but was conspired against by his own party and you call socialism a boogey man we are far closer than you think the problem is you probably agree with them and cant see it for what it is
television,removed,i have and the minuscule changes that occur and the response by the freaks who obsess over it makes me so sick to my stomach ive learned to ignore it all for my own health and well being
television,removed,the biggest possible twist and most unexpected ending would be if the republicans and democrats set their differences aside and worked together to benefit the us as a whole lol imagine that
television,removed,literally trumped
television,removed,totally agree
television,removed,isnt this the guy that contacted patton oswalt on twitter to laugh at him because his wife died im pretty sure thats him
television,removed,i still say that one of the major third parties needs to nominate a celebrity as their candidate preferably someone wellliked and wellspoken of course one of the biggest things holding them back is that they get barely any media coverage and nominating a celebrity would guarantee that theyd actually get coverage

television,removed,whilst i sort of agree with you i also still believe its a shitty thing to do i think its a damn shame to spoil what could literally be a onceinalifetime piece of media just because people cant be assed to have a bit of courtesy i watched fight club for the first time about a week ago and i really enjoyed it but i know for certain that i wouldnt have even touched the film if i had been aware of the plot twist ive never even understood the whole oh but its been out for a while so get over it argument you think the whole world just watches tv andor film at exactly the same time you do and if they dont do so within an arbitrary amount of time they can just get fucked right
television,removed,my story is not bullshit i just cant prove it but youre a dick and your comments are proof alone its really my fault for leaving myself vulnerable instead of looking for ways to earn internet points like you are i will leave you with a piece of advice which you cant think of yourself if you want comments with evidence ask for comments with evidence if you dont want replies from people who explicitly tell you that they do not have evidence write as such if you one day honestly have a question unlike today dont start dicking around for easy karma if you want people to answer truthfully

television,removed,will bill nye dispell the claim that all the races are equal on his show if you arent antiscience then do you acknowledge the physical differences between the races such as brain size and skull structure and the differences in intelligence quotient test performance the physical differences alone prove that the races have evolved separately from one another and when you combine that data with the differences in intelligence quotient test performance and school performance it becomes clear that the races do not perform the same physically or mentally if the environment is the causing factor for the different scores and performance then why is the data and results persistent through every country and civilization why is it that in every country the data is always the same where eastasians score higher than whites and whites score higher than africans jewishamerican average intelligence quotient level asianamerican whiteamerican hispanicamerican blackamerican subsaharan african australian aboriginal
television,removed,oooh a show about liberal science no thanks
television,removed,the moment bill nye went political he lost all credibility thats a scientific fact by the way the same kind of fact that bill nye will be selling on his new show
television,removed,newsflash youre an asshole though no one needs a source other than talking to you to confirm that it seems you need to take your meds and calm down
television,removed,mmm
television,removed,do you make or uphold any morality judgments that are not based on scientific evidence hard for me to say it seems pretty likely though i know a lot of people who believe that abortion is morally permissible but i think it would be stretch to link that belief to a scientific foundation depends on what you mean by scientific foundation you can take the knowledge science has given us and decide your moral position you can present an argument based on that knowledge that may be valid for instance antireproductiverights people often take the scientific knowledge about when a heart starts beating and hold it up to support their argument theres a scientific basis there but they have no argument that obligates us to accept their view based on that scientific knowledge morality in general really is very partitioned from science because it goes beyond the fundamental truth claims of science how things are and proceeds onward to how things should be indeed a moral stance is a decision about what the right answer is to a question which doesnt have an answer point being all of us on some level or another hold values or beliefs that cannot be based in any scientific foundation of course it can be as explained above i can point out that life started several billion years ago its factually incorrect that it starts at conception or at any point along the way during pregnancy in principle i think any of our beliefs could have a scientific foundation thats different from saying we are obligated to believe them by science to then claim that religious people somehow uniquely dont understand how to think scientifically is a little unfair i didnt say uniquely there are lots of ways to think irrationally the religious dont have a monopoly on foolishness their scientificunscientific beliefs are partitioned differently but again all people do this in one way or another they choose to reject the core scientific principle that beliefs about the world must be justified by evidence you cant partition your theearthisflat belief from your scientific beliefs and claim you think scientifically

television,removed,for the same reason there are any statute of limitations note this is about the theory not the specific laws which vary dramatically evidence and witness accounts become increasingly uncertain over time it becomes predominantly a hesaid shesaid affair of people fabricatingstretching evidence that is no longer applicable certainly not to the degree of certainty ie beyond reasonable doubt this is particularly important in crimes that are based on testimony in lieu of physical evidence you have an obligation to seek out justice within a reasonable time yeah as a kid that makes it difficult and an argument could certainly be made that it should be within x years of reaching perceived adulthood but its also keeps court cases from piddling around forever its a do it now wall that forces things to either piss or get off the pot without it the courts would be far more overwhelmed as people dredged up past claimsmanufactured claims to sling at each other which is already quite a commonplace thing theres less benefit from pursuing conviction also can be debatable but i dont see mr cosby date raping at this point its retributive justice instead of attempting to reduce future criminality retributive justice arguably has just as much merit from a moral perspective but from a societal perspective its somewhat limited and has little correlation with reducing criminal behavior the crime has essentially passed yes there are aftershocks but at a certain point theres nothing more to gain if you were punched in a bar years ago who would gain by punishing the puncher the exceptions often murder genocide war crimes etc are viewed as sufficiently heinous that its essentially worth the gamble of missjustice to convict and punish those committing the acts however degredation of evidence causes many of the proceedings to become farces and scapegoating as people try to justify the horrible way humans treat each other by treating bystanders in a similarly horrible way sex crime statutes are already an abomination by any reasonable constitutional standardsex offender registry and a wildcard by legal procedural standards people are found guiltyinnocent with remarkably little rhyme or reason other than being able to cry well in front of an audience or scare the accused into accepting a deal no need to make it even more of a blamesmear game

television,removed,s winifred burkle amy acker didnt even leave the show she just struck around as illyria but seriously fuck that episode
television,removed,as one of the lefties i think a big appeal of the trump impersonation is that so many people who voted against him dont understand how he was elected as jon stewart many people thought trump disqualified himself at numerous points during his campaign trump would say things that seemed absurd and many times were categorically false yet he won for many people it feels like he exists in some alternate reality where everyone around you doesnt seem to be hearing the same things you are the appeal of the trump impersonations is not to just have a lets make fun of that guy circle jerk although ill admit im sure it plays a part but its letting people know im hearing the same things you are im seeing the same things you are and we all agree its pretty crazy now jon stewart also pointed out in that same video that we cant define all of his supporters by the worst of his rhetoric theres a balance we have to have regarding how to handle the situation we are in but in terms of a comedy sketch shows impersonation of the president i dont think its just about the left feeding on their hate and enjoying mimicry of trump i think theres a deeper level of people saying please tell me youre seeing what im seeing and hearing what im hearing snl provides that
television,removed,were those facts anything like this you just posted lmao keep crying filthy shill hillary lost cuz she preferred sleeping over campaigning youre just mad she lost michigan owell maybe she shouldve visited then trump is actually bringing jobs back something even obama couldnt its going to be a looooong years for you hahhahhaha high quality posting for sure well done

television,removed,haha you fell for his bullshit
television,removed,the way the dnc and media really did cheat for her probably made more of a difference that i understood at first sounds like a lack of ethics all the smoke put out by all the investigation made people say where there is smoke there is fire and distrust her she did have a private email server which for what she was doing with it was illegal further investigations were to determine how sensitive the material on the server was she was cleared from the original investigation due to some really bs reasons that boiled down to she didnt mean to break the law and it wasnt that important another successful tactic because of the lack of ethics in the conservative world really you going to single out conservatives here conservatives didnt break the law for hillary or set up the private server they didnt try to hide it for her either conservatives then didnt rig a primary for her either either start calling everyone out on the bullshit or stop trying to set up a they dont like hillary cause shes a woman and obama cause hes a nggr stop being so blind if more people did that wed have better elections
television,removed,wow theyre so brave
television,removed,need someone to talk to never once did i mention my political leanings so please try not to over react and down vote me when i say this but you are a complete jackass

television,removed,oh the irony do you understand irony i dont understand your comment are there no powerful people to be mocked even liberals or situations like institutional racism its almost like you are either dishonest or stupid to think obama and other liberals have not been mocked at all
television,removed,i saw highlyupvoted people in rpolitics a couple weeks ago who really truly believed that pepe had been coopted by white nationalists during the election their reasoning was that youd have to be an idiot to think the major media outlets would run the story if it wasnt true
television,removed,if you call a group of minorities regardless of their race as uneducated based on statistics then thats racist sure thing buddy you keep pretending to be outraged
television,removed,you just proved his point by calling out his quote which is actually a quote from the show dumbfuck
television,removed,nah i was shoving freaks like you into trash cans and lockers so you wouldnt shoot up your school
television,removed,i liked it plenty up until it hit cliche town it was really interesting and original up until oh theyve gained sentience now they want to destroy all humans i got it i didnt think it was particularly complex its just that its been done to death and its the oldest ai trope under the sun that plus the amount of mental gymnastics you have to do to suspend disbelief for the techs helping maeve and the whole subsurface storyline in the second half of the season made me wish theyd tried for something new instead of cowboy skynet
television,removed,i have a couple questions still bugging me not sure if theyre plot holes maybe someone can explain incoming spoilers have none of the employeesdirectors seen what arnold looks like i mean he cofounded the park plus theres a picture of him on fords desk how has nobody noticed the fact that arnold and bernard look identical did william do the dolores narrative over and over while hes young throughout the season are we watching bits and pieces of multiple trips he had with her its weird because shes the one leading him to some place shes searching for that shes already been to and when she switches back and forth between being alone and being with him she asks him if shes having flashbacks or if this is now so if she went alone which she did at the end why is she having flashbacks of being alone when she was with him the alone part shouldnt have happened yet
television,removed,thats a lot of stupidity and obnoxiousness compressed into just ill just have to trust that anybody else who sees this can see
television,removed,i want that black chick to sit on my face can anyone make that happen

television,removed,trump supporters dont care because we think he is entitled to having a chip on his shoulder hillary despite her mountain of material was unscathed by this show also a lot of what trump does is uncover the medias hypocrisy he is a shrewd guy on social media and knows exactly what he is doing a spray tan and toupee consistently outduels the bought media
television,removed,read the comment again notice how it says that trump has taken more shit from these people who are these people an intelligent person may ask why great question since the very next sentence starts with a reference to late night shows and the context of this debate is a video made by conan mocking trump could these people be late night show hosts ya think now does the statement hold true that late night show hosts have given more shit to trump that obama yes it does i honestly cant remember once that oliver or conan or that nonfunny guy who replaced stewart or any one else for that matter spoke of obama with the kind of resentment and vitriol they speak of trump daily it would hold true for nonpolitical entertainment tv in general it would probably hold true for all of tv if you excluded fox news and whatever your opinion of trump its frankly amazing that you cant see that actually i take my last comment back your ability to read is perfectly adequate its your conditioned brainwashing that twists and turns every piece of information into bricks that fit a structured narrative you didnt misunderstand his comment because youre stupid its much worse than that you misunderstood it because your ideological shades are so dark you can no longer perceive reality in any sort of objective way
television,removed,why do you think it didnt

television,removed,as a long time fan of cohen it felt like they were using his death as a way to mourn the loss of clinton not winning it was a bit over the top and cringe i normally hate when people use cringe as i feel its thrown around a lot too often but i really did wince when i saw it because it was obvious what the intention of the skit was for now i know its possible to mourn the death of cohen and give him a tribute while also making a political statement but it really felt inappropriate especially because of how overtly biased snl had gotten i have no issue with political bias i mean everyone has their own political stanceideology and that includes actorswriters but snl has always excelled precisely because they have stayed politically neutral and lambast everyone from both sides this was not the case this election and again its not even so much that they took a side that was the problem it was that it became preachy circlejerky which really took away from the comedy its why ill never understand how some people praise the newsroom i actually agree with most of sorkins political views but half the dialogue in that show was so preachy and over the top that it basically became a soapbox for the creator where characters would randomly just break out into speeches yeah i know thats sorkins style but this was much worse so yeah that piano intro was really pretty ridiculous and the fact that they used cohens death as a way to facilitate that made it much worse made it feel insincere as well as over dramatic which then took away from honoring his actual death
television,removed,youre a rude thoughtless little pig
television,removed,globalist scum
television,removed,the rise of trump is stupidity and fragile ego
television,removed,youre really slow you guys are stuck in the election mode ill give a few months when you realize trump is president and that his mistake and his issues are all on him and not hillary 👴👴👴👵
television,removed,maybe someone should try and kill him to see what hed do you know for science
television,removed,surprised you took the dick out of your mouth and wrote something
television,removed,love your high horse concern trolling oh poor other personyour world in turmoil for not seeing the world as i do lol i mentioned john stewart which was relevant to educate you of the metal bubble people have been living in during the election not a policy bubble which you mentioned there you go projecting your idea that if some one disagrees with you then that person is full of hate it could not possibly be that you might be living in a bubble oh no its some one else who is full of hate and must calm down well at least you are not dictating to me that i must stop responding to you you highness

television,removed,patrick warburton as lemony was my favorite part of the show i absolutely love his narration so distinctive and so hilarious nph actually exceeded my expectations definitely a different interpretation but i love it theres a lot of campy cgi and other campy stuff that i feel fits the mood of the show it doesnt take itself seriously i was so surprised by this show and i admire it a lot its not absolutely perfect but the attention to detail and the humor is enough to redeem everything else in my eyes i dont really feel like the target audience is children there is a ton of mature humor like land ho dont call me that and mature implications all through out it just like the books im and im never bored i fucking love this show my ex who introduced me to it is and loved it as well hell my parents love it and theyre in their and violet changes clothing quite a bit and i much prefer it to the emo goth model look in the movie i think some of the bad campy acting is amazingi actually loved joan cusack and mr po shrugs i love monty in the reptile room even more and the people they cast as olafs henchman are amazing especially hook man i am actually incredibly surprised people are so critical of it in this thread i found the movie incredibly obnoxious and off i absolutely love the series its hilarious and wonderful
television,removed,i think the music cinematography casting and general tone are far far better in the seriesthis is coming from someone who absolutely hates that movie though
television,removed,i mentioned in the sub that it was like lemony snicket and wes anderson had a baby because the framing and the shots and the attention to detail is so incredible i completely agree with you i can watch this show so many times and see new things each time i absolutely love it
television,removed,hes from the daily show when it was jon stewart and he was amazing i had no idea the acting would be so polarizing i loved most of the people they cast
television,removed,i dont understand why people are so hung up on realism in shows like thisto me its very clearly a story the narrator is an integral part of it like a fairy tale or any other where the characters are outlandish are not based in reality this isnt gritty realism its afantastical full of dark humor its not set in reality obviously so i do not need their dialogue to be completely realistic i hated the movie and absolutely loved the show it takes a bit to get on its feet but i thought it was perfect
television,removed,josephine was the only casting i absolutely hated in the series that said i think the movie is worse in all respects
television,removed,sorry real life is about to be more thrilling and chilling than anything they can cook up for on this show

television,removed,george costanza as played by jason alexander not underrated jason alexander comedic actor singer and voice artist decidedly underrated former broadway star voiceover pro standup comedian and yet george costanza is the only thing people remember him for granted its the kind of role that defines a lifetime but itd be nice to see alexander getting praise and notice for his work in other things fun fact alexander played the dick van dyke role in a tv movie of bye bye birdie he may not be as gifted of a dancer as van dyke was but hes a much better singer one of the songs in the show famously has the main character drop out near the end and a random ensemble member sings the challenging last line while the main guy looks on alexander was actually able to sing the final line himself

television,removed,hey a loss of viewers means a increase in price after all
television,removed,i really liked him until i watched that video of him accepting an oscar he wasnt nominated for it comes across as inappropriate a lot of people invested time into the project let the other two people who were actually nominated have their moment
television,removed,but he wasnt awarded he wasnt nominated it just feels odd i totally see your point but conversely ethan tremblay was amazing in room and brie larson didnt bring him on stage when she won if walton goggins wanted to win he should have submitted his name along with theirs it almost comes across as desperate some people still think he won an oscar when he didnt
television,removed,i appreciate your take and im trying to get this bad taste out of my mouth over this the etiquette usually in this case is to say thank you then politely decline hes kind of promoting himself as an actor when he gets on the stage at the show all of hollywood can see him it just cheapens him for me for some reason imagine this two people are about to exchange vows at a formal wedding ceremony the bride and groom are so happy the brides mother gave birth to her because the bride wouldnt exist without the mother so she stands right beside them during the vows and also has her own vows i mean i guess thats okay but its not common and its almost creepy every film actor wants to win an oscar it just had a very contrived feeling to me
television,removed,the etiquette i described is what is customary and you have to admit being on the stage at the oscars is very different than walking down the street and i do think it would be odd for a coach to stand on a medal podium with their athlete its not typical unless the athlete got hurt and the coach was holding them up im going to think about your opinions and think about this though
television,removed,im a year old white guy who grew up in the suburbs and the last couple of concerts ive been to have varied from old school west coast rappers irish folk singers and caribbean reggae bands without torrenting and the internet theres absolutely zero chance id be going to any of those concerts

television,removed,from what ive heard from my friends that are casual fans of shows like these the mcu has sort of fatigued them in recent years whereas dcs movie and tv side being separate makes them feel like separate universes so they can enjoy them independently without that fatigue flash and arrow are definitely not as high quality as the marvelnetflix shows but they have this inexplicable other element that make them almost more entertaining im still trying to get them back into agents of shield though im hoping the ghost rider stuff will get them curious because i dont want to spoil the ward thing for them
television,removed,what the fuck does this have to do with anything
television,removed,i think fx is better than netflix in terms of quality i think always sunny fargo and atlanta are all better than anything netflix has yet to make
television,removed,what are your five favorite netflix shows if i put those up against the five best hbo shows it probably wont be a contest it would be even more ridiculous if we compared the top shows of each network i would take a third tier hbo show like eastbound and down over any comedy netflix has done also netflix hasnt been able to keep the quality on any of their shows up past the season i think people are still in the honeymoon phase with netflix and give them a few more years of mediocre house of cards and especially if stranger things two doesnt live up people will start wondering what they are spending a year on and if they cant just insta pirate the two things they like
television,removed,are you fucking retarded you replied to a comment that was calling out the comment that stupidly brought steam into the discussion when it didnt belong at all

television,removed,they quoted a post that was a rather thorough example of the criticism being leveled at the pastors and asked for a response yup this is politics you cant call someone a wife beater directly you simply cite experts or people who say you beat your wife so that you get that nice talking point right next to it then when the person refutes you and calls you out on being racist you sigh dishearteningly like the person is a runaway child and then blast them again and accuse them of being paid off
television,removed,fuck the mindy project never have i ever wanted to smash a cynder block through a bitches face before soooooo bad i would have rather have creed or merideth have their own show but that stupid ugly bitch should not have her own show like at all

television,removed,people forget that the russell era could be pretty bad too when looking back journeys end was pretty awful for example
television,removed,yeah its not like game of thrones where if you miss an episode you may feel a bit lost more like xfiles in that some episodes really dont contribute much to the season long arcs though some episodes are key usually the episodes written by the lead writers currently steven moffat who also writes the bbc sherlock series tend to be the most important
television,removed,man that brunette is hot i want her

television,removed,great show discovered canadian white trash on youtube yrs ago and was hooked after watching every episode a million times i cant figure out why it wasnt picked up states side by comedy central theyve kinda jumped the shark but left or seasons of pure gold

television,removed,im pretty sure the democrats have no control of house and senate and the president regardless this has nothing to do with tv please refrain from talking about thisor ill ask that you be banned as a clinton shill
television,removed,ive mostly read that chris evans took it too seriously an executive producer quit before the first programme was aired because of his micro managing hes been accused of similar behaviour on his radio and virgin radio shows in the midlate its been reported too that evans and le blanc dont get on particularly after evans was so obsequiously apologetic after the cenotaph incident and sort of implied it was due to le blancs american ignorance rather than the british crews decision to make a film there since evans has a daily morning programme on bbc radio presents an early evening show on a regular basis and signed a series contract for the top gear reboot i sincerely doubt that the bbc could be strong armed by matt le blanc who although an unexpectedly likeable and knowledgeable presenter isnt considered much more than a former sitcom star in the uk into dropping him more likely they reacted to the massive criticism of evans half arsed clarkson impression
television,removed,really good tons of great little touches i loved the explosion
television,removed,id imagine hes quiet because hes tired from creating that awesomeness
television,removed,truly ingenious i can tell that he put so much of his blood sweat and testoterone secretions into every single second of this and the businessman that made every statement sound like a question magnificent

television,removed,drink a bottle of drano shitposter
television,removed,no its not and thats ok not everything has to be the greatest blank ever
television,removed,simpsons is filled with jokes its probably one of the most densely packed joke show on tv due to the format the subtle ones on the background are usually funnier than the stuff happening on the foreground in my case and i appreciate the hard work it takes for the writers to make a joke that very few people will notice by design plus its way easier to get away with uncensored or far fetched jokes if they are hidden in the background for a couple of seconds rather than be the main plot point
television,removed,is babylon worth watching or is it more niche scifi ie stargate
television,removed,yeah we are so hard on female characters they get away with and even cheered on when slapping punching or throwing drinks on a male character yet if a male character touches a female character with any more force than a mouse fart even in self defence the male character is seen as worse than scum

television,removed,and you posted this because
television,removed,the americans watched the first season in a couple nights and started on the second i like it but i dont see it as super genius yet one thing that bothered is how they handled characters that die spoilers when amador dies you know nothing about him except that he used to date martha and was beemans partner you feel no personal connection to the character that just died because he just delivered a few jokes and that was it but then after he dies you get an episode of flashbacks that develop the character and by that point you dont care about amador anymore same thing happened with zhukov he gets killed and then elizabeth gets upset because she had a story with him that we were completely unaware of then they serve flashbacks that explain why you should care about him but ive heard only good things about the show so ill keep watching for now
television,removed,and here weve watched every episode

television,removed,yes i love seinfeld seinfeld makes me notice the difference less than cheers though it could be the smoking in the bar that makes it feel more separated from modern times too i believe the characters on cheers are a bit more blue collar than seinfeld which makes them a bit more relatable for me
television,removed,its not an error he wasis a star and is a recognizable name for most folks to find a reason to check out the show youre a troll by finding a small detail that can be disputed instead of adding anything constructive to the conversation youre knitpicking a title instead of relating to the point of the post im quoting carla rhea perlman here when i say youre slime

television,removed,i require proof
television,removed,i was head writer of atla azula and zukos relationship was not always well understood even by the team internally azula loved zuko more than anyone save her father she also felt competitive with him for their parents attention of course but since she had alienated herself from her mother she focused her energy on pleasing dad which of course meant acting in more and more intense and possibly evil ways by the end of the series of course her loss of her friends shatters the part of her identity that she could somehow control affection and love through intimidation as a result she spirals i did however intend to leave a kernel of humanity and had we made a season azula would have completely bottomed and we would have explored the possibility of a path to redemption true story aaron

television,removed,the position she had on clintons campaign team was purely ceremonial with no real responsibility no pay either i doubt it why would they give her a job where she does nothing has no real responsibility and pay her for it because they felt sorry for her can you point to one actual definitive thing someone did to aid one campaign over the other the director of communications luis miranda and his deputy both resigned discussed contacting media outlets to attempt to get them to before an important primary is donna brazile emailling john podesta and jessica palmieri about an upcoming debate question debbie herself repeated slated bernie and his staffers in emails look up her comments about jeff weaver or saying bernie knows nothing about the party or wont be president impartial and the dnc was getting advice from the clinton campaign lawyer in regards to accusations by bernies campaign about funding what about the superdelegates who declared for clinton before the primaries even began now i already know that you have predetermined your opinion on all this much like the dnc and their presumptive nominee lol you probably wont even read the emails and if you did you wouldnt grasp what they meant so let me lay it out for you in short they favoured hillary they promoted her they slated sanders internally they created an atomsphere of contempt around bernie and they aided her dont think they aided her then good luck saying that the russians didnt aid trump they created a narrative and colluded with the media to sway popular opinion

television,removed,nah i liked it better this way it was proper closure which is what the writers promised in interviews before the season aired one has to remember that this show has mysterious elements but is about the emotional rollercoasters of the characters at the end of the day and the last episodes nailed it in that aspect plus it did end on a bit of a cliffhanger too baptiste counting backwards and stopping at

television,removed,it really doesnt the gay cops storyline adds nothing to the overall plot goes nowhere for a while and then he dies and thats just one example every character has major problems with how they tie into the story its all very rushed and it felt sloppy was a bad show i basically dont consider it and to be part of the same show is true detective is an abortion
television,removed,i think it would be amazing if the creators of the show made good with thomas ligotti and hired him to pen a couple of episodes

television,removed,honestly yeah i worked this job years ago and if someone obviously wasnt interested andor straight up said no id leave them be the worst were the ones that act interested and say theyre coming back and then never do

television,removed,go to anywhere on the planet in your mind right now got it fixed in your mind good now think about what the major religion in the area is got it locked down stupendous now what are you picturing most likely you are picturing one of three things one you are picturing someone from that church who used to or is currently leading it if you are then they are the example for the rest of their church to follow if you look at the top of an organization and all you see is love acceptance is very open about the finances and church ordinances and legitimate care for other human beings then that is a pretty good indicator that this church doesnt teach others to be intolerant the next thing you are likely to think of is most likely a god of the religion well screw you i told you to think of a person biiiiiiitch however we can work with a god now historically having just one god isnt a popular thing because man kind likes to be able to picture and understand things splitting gods into different small parts think ancient greek with zeus hades poseidon makes them manageable and more easily comprehended in modern times however man has moved to a more solitary god not strictly true since im sure the religions i know nothing about in the east have gods a piece but regardless of how many gods or what they are there is always one that loves mankind unconditionally the modern trend of one god also shows and god that is wrathful but loves his children on earth lastly you are thinking of a stereotype of the religion in which case there is nothing to talk about because a stereotype may be in place for a reason but that reason isnt necessarily because its true propaganda the news and your own prejudice is what feels stereotypes
television,removed,the alternative actually knows what the fuck shes doing
television,removed,teen titans go is awesome though thats coming from a year old that never actually watched the teen titans

television,removed,he handled hillary pretty well
television,removed,well there are some dumb motherfuckers about i like to elucidate people nam saying
television,removed,everyone on the hype train
television,removed,if so that is ridiculous commission should be reserved for highly personalized securities with no good substitute not for a pretty standard product whose merit in a standard retirement portfolio would be questionable even if it had a more reasonable commission i really hope there is a good explanation for why one would in good faith recommend such a product
television,removed,good question i think chase was trying to make us feel a certain way expect something bad to happen perhaps that was a way of putting us in tonys shoes thats why when we see every potential threat coming through the doors its from tonys pov every person that comes through holstens looks like people whove tried to kill or been killed by tony showing us that theres no knowing who might be behind tonys life ending event or what they may look like maybe itll be two blacks guys maybe itll be a friend or maybe a random guy in a members only jacket fair enough i just find the whole thing all too convenient the best way to show someones death from a pov is to black screen and thats what we get for as far as i know the first time in tv history hence the confusion the cat theory its hard to say throughout the latter half of the series they really started leaning on these almost supernatural aspects like paulie with the medium chrissy coming out of his brush with death with hallucinations and of course tonys dreams etc i wouldnt totally discount it its possible theyre all red herrings though none of them really seem to lead anywhere and it seems weird that theyd employ this sort of shakespearean foreshadowing in a show that was very much rooted in reality but like i said its hard to say i dont know good points the part that gets me though is how paulie had a bad vibe about the cat after he killed chrissys gf and how that cat kept string at the picture of chrissy makes you wonder let me pose this question to you why would the hit man need to go to the bathroom first then come out and shoot tony from behind why would he wait around at the bar walking up to somes face especially someone whos head is on a swivel looking for an assassin has a much lower success rate than sneaking up behind him and just blasting his brains out all over the table doing it this way gives tony zero chance of survival face to face its a dice roll so he just sits at the bar pretending to be a customer eating at the counter then tony isnt suspicious if a guy just walks up to him when he first gets there tony might still be sizing everyone up and on guard
television,removed,this is hilarious start to finish insight into the thought process of a piece of shit til there are people so fucking disgusting that theyll equate allowing people to not cater to homosexuals and the mass murder of homosexuals
television,removed,so im not going to disavow statements that i think are right you can suck on a gigantic islamic cock im proud of who i am and none of your well honed leftie shaming tactics will operate here
television,removed,
television,removed,i dont think there are any predominantly muslim communities see this
television,removed,same here but to be honest unless they change up the contentpace i dont see an adult audience liking it at all i feel like samurai jack wa definetely a kid shownot just because there was no sex or blood but because of its simplecrude dialogue uneventful episodes and lack of continuity dont get me wrong i absolutely love the show but having recently rewatched a lot of episodes i find it hard to believe an episode lije jack and evil jack or jack and his newfound pet or tgat episode where jack is a chicken would actually be watched a whole lot on adult swim it isnt really satire like other adult swim content as good as it is it is still a childrens cartoon and im not sure people will find it lives up to their nostalgia tinted expectations either this season will be a lot more fast paced or perhaps im wrong and grown ups still have the patience to watch what sometimes amounts to a whole lot of buildup for relatively little payoff then again plenty of grown up people watch my little pony so perhaps theres a good chance it will still be liked but seriously go back qnd watch a random episode there is suprisingly little going on in most episodesi kike it as it gives ne a zen vive but i have odd tastes
television,removed,nice im glad you suddenly care well timed long after your impassioned sensationalism using the weight of this tragedy to lend credence to your blatant bigotry but just in time to equate cultural marxism with islamic terrorism youre something else ducman as you have no interest in discussing solutions only problems and because youre an insufferable twat were just gonna have to agree to disagree thats all i have left to say to you
television,removed,theyre just a bunch of white people nothing happens anyways
television,removed,as for magazine size you can just reload like the shooter did which is easy within a moments familiarity with a firearm theres a great video im looking that shows a first time shooter putting multiple rounds on target with a full mag vs multiple reloads and the time difference is negligible also with a bit of
television,removed,ha you can put rounds a minute through a shotgun if youre quick
television,removed,ieds may be illegal but you can pop down to any gun shopcabelasgander mountain and buy all the tannerite you want a binary explosive far more destructive than a firearm you can also buy gasoline on literally every street corner
television,removed,fertilizer diesel bomb have you been asleep for the last years
television,removed,hell the puckle gun was created in dumbasses still think the revolution was fought with muskets
television,removed,heres httpsenwikipediaorgwikipucklegun that beats you by years stationary but still
television,removed,why does she stand so wide
television,removed,wait shes not even american deport
television,removed,um no its typically purchased in bags or by the truckload you can also go to any paint shop and buy powdered aluminium and iron oxide the two ingredients in thermite a substance that will burn in a vacuum or underwater
television,removed,the only thing there as loose as much of the us is for single shot type weapons or guns used for competition shooting nope they can legally own many of the same things us citizens can including assault rifles and they have the right to buy a suppressor from any mom pop hardware store for about something an american has to struggle with the batfe over for months
television,removed,gun laws will not stop criminals only law abiding citizens which is the point
television,removed,lets not lose context here yes the revolution against the british empire was fought with muskets sabers rifles repeaters mortars cannons and massive warships all of which were state of the art and privately owned when the constitution was written the country had just fought a war a war that was won by citizens that were armed appropriately to the threat that is why the amendment is so simply worded the ability of the people to fight any threat no matter the technology or size shall not be infringed
television,removed,and for you americans that disagree compare your to those drones you give obama shit for all the fucking time yeah use your guns to defend against that who pilots a drone genius
television,removed,you really think an is gonna do anything against and if its the people vs the government you think an leveling a neighborhood full of women and children is going to calm people down
television,removed,it may be easy to kill one man without a gun but is another story or until theres another okc or or ira attack
television,removed,convince myself of what exactly that fertilizer exists
television,removed,oh so youre talking about registration where the government knows every owner of every weapon well for one thats illegal for good reason secondly it would be impossible to track laughably naively impossible
television,removed,that somehow your average person would take the time to build a bomb with hundreds of lbs of fertilizer and gallons of diesel um yeah since those things fly under the radar and dont require any sort of background check or government scrutiny httpsenwikipediaorgwikioklahomacitybombing just buying an automatic weapon to do his bidding way to show your ignorance you cant just buy an automatic weapon they cost upwards of and require a year vetting process by the federal government
television,removed,pretty sure i addressed that the only way around this is private sales which american gun owners have been begging the government to open the nics to citizens so they can do bg checks on private sales the batfe refuses
television,removed,can you read weapon registration is illegal
television,removed,tell me why the government shouldnt know who own guns the very nature of democracy and the bill of rights
television,removed,in some states no nationwide a few states try their own bullshit but the sc stated weapon registration to be unconstitutional just because ny or ca shits on the constitution doesnt make it just just like ms not ratifying the amendment until doesnt mean slavery was legal can you not fucking read not things that you ninjaedit in no i cant there is nothing preventing it from being made legal sc decision will of the people
television,removed,that doesnt mean we shouldnt fix it it isnt a problem if anything we should fix it before it gets to be impossible its long been impossible its been impossible since the day this nation was founded thats the point
television,removed,thats not an automatic you ignorant fool
television,removed,yes the system is in place the government refuses to open it to private citizens why is that
television,removed,the fact that the government cant easily disarm the populace using a registration list is a problem to you because that is the one and only usage of a registration list disarmament
television,removed,im not arguing semantics youre arguing with ignorance the fact you dont even understand something you think should be regulated is appaling its like putting a hillbilly in charge of space exploration
television,removed,dont you mean chopsticks
television,removed,the sc has continually refused to hear lower court decisions on registration essentially confirming their legality including in new york and california which makes those decisions illegal as for the ninja edit i expounded a second after i posted no you responded at least minutes afterward as per the asterisk next to your comment of course none of that changed my initial post which is what you needed to fucking read and obviously didnt no i read it and subsequently crushed it
television,removed,they know the homes you own they know the cars you own because im a patriot and i pay my taxes why are guns so special see the amendment multiple sc cases also the very nature of democracy where in any definition of democracy does it touch on gun control amendment multiple sc cases typical catchphrases and deflecting tired of repeating year old shouldbe common knowledge seriously what is your problem if the government knew you owned a gun sigh amendment what is your personal concern other than some random ideology that doesnt even make sense and what ideology do you entertain that i belong to as for the bill of rights that is up to the court system in which gun registration has been upheld no you are misinformed what is your personal issue with it again amendment
television,removed,shall not be infringed but also httpsenwikipediaorgwikidistrictofcolumbiavheller reaffirmed it
television,removed,the people who wrote the constitution knew times were changing they lived in a time of the largest advancement in technology the human race had ever known they were educated worldtravelled intelligent people they knew the rapid expansion that was about to come they saw the advancements in warfare metallurgy and medicine thats precisely why the constitution was written the way it was and worded so simply they knew the value of an armed populace in time of a threat to the nation they wanted to maintain a populace that could fight a threat no matter what thats why it says arms and shall not be infringed
television,removed,trackinginfringement do you not get that
television,removed,really disappointing conan shouldve stuck to your no politics policy
television,removed,there is nothing specific in the amendment concerning gun registration um yes there is four simple words the rest of your comment is rambling and not worth addressing really
television,removed,how about this if i ever get the chance id love to be in the rightwingdeathsquad that kicks in your front door to take your family to the gulag if ever i get the chance
television,removed,in gonna go take a nap and when i come back this comment will have likes﻿
television,removed,youre being downvoted by people who dont live in the bush emus are extremely territorial and aggressive
television,removed,it seems like the advocates of gun owernship in america only base it on stories that some powerful lobby group tells all the time im absolutely puzzled why the most powerful figure in the world is powerless to just issue a gun ban who are these crazy fucks that think they need an automatic rifle used in war to sleep sound at night in a fucking city maybe all the way out in the woods where laura ingles were killin injuns and shit
television,removed,i didnt know it was german because the toy is always made in china
television,removed,against our governmentmilitary if we needed to you mean tanks drones special forces shoulder fired antipersonnel weapons sure is going to spank the government with a bunch of pee shooters might have been true hundreds of years ago before tanks airplanes military was invented
television,removed,you realize they were dictators and killed millions of their own citizens right when they were barely scraping by how the fuck did they own guns when they werent even able to afford food
television,removed,guns are designed to kill they are optimized for that purpose you dont fucking eat spaghetti with a glock now do you
television,removed,except ford isnt sitting around how to make the car more lethal right what other possible use is there for a gun do you use it to scratch your ass get the fuck outta here
television,removed,pressure cookers are used in the kitchen do you use guns to cook turkey do you shoot bread to warm it up instead of a microwave i cant believe how fucking stupid people are they have no concept of analogies

television,removed,you realize that out of mass shootings in the past years have been using firearms legally purchased in the united states right you realize the difference between a trained financed terror operation vs mentally unstable people buying guns legally to act out their own anger and deranged views you are a fucking dumbass
television,removed,hunting recreational shooting protection really so you need to use a fucking to hunt wild boars do you have any other hobbies than shooting at cans and drinking beer and fucking your cousin in a trailer protection from injuns

television,removed,yes grandma
television,removed,boring lines used by progun ppl guns dont kill ppl ppl kill ppl should we ban cars then except bmw isnt making cars that are lethal on purpose what other utility does a gun provide besides shooting bullets to create damage do you use it as a dildo its our constitution to stop tyrannical government against the worlds most advanced and powerful army navy air force your against a drone and tank play homefront instead
television,removed,using per capita on mass shootings akin to measuring gdp per capita is retarded all those countries you listed has far far less incidents compared to us they dont even pale in comparison when combined and plus you left out china which pretty much has negligible mass shootings and they have more population so your per capita argument is moot and where are you pulling these numbers from i got some fact for
television,removed,im sorry dude but conan absolutely does not have an armed body guard period its one security officer in the studio while the show is taping who has a concealed pistol pick one

television,removed,war isnt won by kdr this isnt a video game
television,removed,kinder surprise youd have to be an idiot to choke on one of them
television,removed,give americans guns and theyll kill people
television,removed,its not that a boltaction wont kill pests its that a semiautomatic does it better and australia law recognises that and allows them for such purposes in some select circumstances pigs for example are often found in big mobs if youre using a boltaction you shoot slower with more recoil and you have to take the time and disrupt the sight picture to operate the bolt a semiautomatic will allow that person to more adequately perform their job a gun commonly used for this purpose in australia is the sks an exmilitary gun which were imported in abundance prior to but an and pattern type rifles can do it just as well
television,removed,httpiimgurcomklkyvhupng good on you for disarming yourself dont expect others to follow you on it fuckoff
television,removed,when the site that operates the drone is overtaken with thousands of armed civilians its a different story drones arent invincible and cant stop everything

television,removed,youre talking about banning islam and various other brown people right because theyre the problem
television,removed,another fucking inbred redneck shithead who cant read
television,removed,your analogy is weak as fuck there is no correlation between door and a cars ability to kill people that makes no sense and has nor relation to guns a closer analogy is selling cars without seat belts you dont have to be a fucking mechanic to know that a car with seat belts will result in less dead people just like you dont have to be a goddamn gun nut to understand that a higher rate of fire and a larger magazine makes it easier for fucking asshats like the guy in orlando to kill more people quicker and easier the has been used in multiple mass shootings for a reason its good at killing people thats why the military used its version the for so fucking long quit your dribble and use your fucking head
television,removed,itt europeans opine on american rights speaking of countries that dont have freedom of speech its fucking laughable

television,removed,your comment was sarcastic and stupid you deserved condescension and you received it next time consider your tone if you think you have a legitimate question yes a director and a writer are not the same thing my comments called his work among the best from a technical standpoint however an episode of television is not a selfcontained apparatus a director can only work so much with the script he is given so yes his work as a director has been very good the episodes themselves have been held back by mediocre writing which is probably out of his control for the most part therefore your comment is meaningless and certainly not warranting any snide tonal choices from you since you obviously didnt have an idea intelligent enough to speak from a point of superiority like i said if you had taken the time or possessed the ability to understand the greater contextual meaning of my post you wouldnt have made your original post we can be done here run along and play

television,removed,the golden globes are and always have been bullshit and by extension the oscars are bullshit you wont get a golden globe nomination unless you or your studio sucks up to ie bribes the hfpa hollywood foreign press association with a press junket access to stars or any number of lucrative combinations of cash and prizes for the hfpa if you dont get a golden globe nomination its very unlikely youll get an oscar nomination who are the hfpa a group of entertainment journalists in a very incestous press relationship that essentially lock out anyone else from joining but thats okay because some of them write blogs and even facebook posts from time to time it goes without saying that their press credentials are at best questionable from personal experience i can say some are flat out nuts and have virtually zero knowledge of the entertainment business edit oh yeah like you people downvoting this arent exactly the types of idiots i describe in my next post in this thread

television,removed,the perfect response to all that whining that black people never win oscars
television,removed,i thought it was general knowledge that black people in general dont work as hard and typically have a bad attitude obviously its a generalization and there are exceptions of course these exceptions should be celebrated since its so easy to create the excuse of an invisible force thats keeping people with increased levels of melanin concentration from succeding btw ive worked with plenty of colored folks and most fulfilled all expectations but were often very entertaining so i didnt mind picking up the slack

television,removed,thanks ill check it out i wish netflix didnt wait a year between seasons for most of their originals
television,removed,typical redditor shitteir summerchild reply right here boys
television,removed,ive heard it said by a lot of people on reddit that theyd like the doctor who if it took itself more seriously so basically theyre wanting it to be star trek or firefly or something i can undertand why theyd think that but doctor who is exactly what it needs to be for the audience its made for its made for families so kids can enjoy the monsters and goofyness while adults can enjoy the scifi and character drama its ok if you dont get it its an aquire taste and it certainly isnt for everyone its honestly hard for me to describe why i love it so much apart from just saying its fun and creative when i first saw my sister watching it i immediately thought it was stupid and hokey too the more i got into it though the more i came to love it theres a lot more going on in that show than is immediately apparent the big thing is dont try to watch it from the beginning youll never get into it the show is broken into the classic series and the revived series but the continuity remains the same its over years of continuity the classic series is for hardcore fans just ignore it for now because you absolutely dont have to know the story going in the first season of the revived series is really rough and will immediately turn off most new comers theres a lot of cringe in that first episode if you really want to see what the show is watch the eleventh hour its the season premiere and meant as a jumping on point its the start of matt smiths doctor the start of a new showrunner and its largely the point where doctor who took off in america start there go through season then jump around however you want

television,removed,got to love the tory governments strategy undermine public services so that they can be sold offreplaced by private businesses since they came in the bbc has been completely gutted the news started showing a lot of bias and a few months later after postproduction on current shows had finished they stopped bringing out good programming they even have a bloody governmentappointed board overseeing the organisation now
television,removed,no hes the guy from austin powers

television,removed,she is scum just like all the other women that use the harassment to build their careers and increase their salaries suing once you are too old to be of interest to ailes is pathetic
television,removed,theres a reason magical realism began in columbia
television,removed,i think david duchovny mulder leaving the xfiles was handled about as well as it could have been having the season following his departure be about finding him was a great choice they also made the wise decision to replace him as the male lead with a character john doggett who wasnt a carbon copy of mulder in fact he was the exact opposite of mulder this brought in a whole new aspect to the show they also did a good job of making doggett a likeable character which was important bc mulder is such a beloved character to xfiles fans
television,removed,steve rhodes in married with children i know many redditers are too young to remember this show or how important groundbreaking and good it was but this one will always stand out to me when he left they did some funny stuff involving him leaving perfectly in line with the show about him giving al a bad loan for his shoe hotline haha lost his job and went off in the sunset in a stupid and ridiculous manner note the actor asked to leave the show but after his leaving we very quickly get introduced to a new character jefferson who is everything the show needed a true foil to our main character al and a push away from the standard good neighbors that was a source of conflict into a hilarious mashup of schemes between al and jefferson
television,removed,michael scott leaving the office there was build up to it and then the actual episode where he leaves is done very well they were able to make it comical and emotional without being too cheesy or sentimental
television,removed,glees probably a good one not a spoiler because the death of cory monteith was very well known and a pretty wellpublicized heroin overdose cory monteith was the true protagonist sure lea michelle was also a lead but the show was all about a dumb jock football player learning he could be something else and do something dorky like glee club they seemed to be setting it up so hed be a glee coach he was going to be endgame so when the season started they did their wellplanned beatles tribute lea michelle sang yesterday in the beginning and it was very sad but they didnt address him in that episode finally they give him his own tribute episode with all the characters responding to grief in different way they talk about his death celebrate his life never mention how he died which was a good way to do it because you dont really want to mention heroin overdoses on a somewhat kidfriendly show
television,removed,dig the reflection of the watcher
television,removed,tasha yar abrupt and unexpected death for a pointless and hated character fuck yes
television,removed,parks and recreation season spoilers ann and chris from parks and rec was handled pretty well in my opinion on the other hand chevt chases departure from community was absolutely lackluster and sudden even though they knew he was leaving well in advance

television,removed,i enjoyed the show it does parody action movies right down to the ridiculous romance storyline thrown in it does seem naked gunish it would be nice to see it picked up might be one of the few tv shows ill bother to watch im starting to feel im being aged out of tv not into gratuitous sexviolencecgi i remember my grandparents and my parents hitting that point in their life where they reacted similarly and my friends and i thought they were being old the last thing that i enjoyed was stranger things dare i mention netflix when i was a kid all things were in now it seems are making a comeback perhaps each generation gets nostalgic and weary of the gratuitous didnt know the tick might be rebooted till saw this thread watching it now so far not very excited about it nor finding it very funny loved the cartoon way back when wasnt a fan of the last live action though
television,removed,ranch me up brotendo

television,removed,hbo announced that theyre adapting asimovs foundation series not sure if this is still happening on july new line cinema cofounders bob shaye and michael lynne were reported to have been signed on to produce an adaptation of the trilogy by their company unique pictures for warner brothers however columbia pictures sony successfully bid for the screen rights on january and then contracted roland emmerich to direct and produce michael wimer was named as coproducer two years later the studio hired dante harper to adapt the books this project failed to materialize and hbo acquired the rights when they became available in
television,removed,not sure if troll or retard
television,removed,cliffhangers can be brilliant when a situation warrants it and when used very sparingly problem is with this show they never make sense theyre used as a device to get people to watch the next week when they normally wouldnt to counter the lazy writing and complete lack of competence with handling the story cliffhangers can be amazing this show even had a few brilliant ones in its past now though every season is flashbacks and filler with cliffhangers tossed on at the end so youll come back if they dont deliver something wildly unexpected basically it must be daryl michonne carl or maggie that meets lucille theyve shit the bed for probably the last time something predictable like glen or a b character wont do anymore that pissed people off way too much and thats probably what it will be i am betting its either glen or abraham both of which wont be acceptable after how they handled the season finale both of which however would have been acceptable had they done it back then they honestly didnt need this cliffhanger they could have showed everything and people would have been stoked for season because negan is the first villain that isnt impotent hes scary hes threatening and theyre powerless against him at this point the cliffhanger was counter productive in every way
television,removed,wow looks like some people dont know how to read usernames
television,removed,of course he will spin his loss into the most lucrative deal he can make but he has to start the process as soon as possible in the middle of a debate if necessary
television,removed,lol youre an idiot last season was one of the best and the most highly rated
television,removed,a lot of shows are sold based on a premise a semioriginal idea possibly with an agreement on who will act and direct and little more the writers dont have a story line and are not committed to much more than just that premise and as the show is picked up and renewed they need to come up with something more to keep viewers interested so they take a turn
television,removed,the homeless man notices an angel smoking a cigarette while crouching on top of the building he loads his gun and shoots the angel as the man approaches the dying angel he notices the striped adidas pantsit was just a slav
television,removed,i have a few thoughts with your permission make him a retireddischarged army sniper this can explain his skills and also gives you the opportunity to shine light on the neglect of post service soldiers and their hardships the idea of him at one point trading a dead angelfeathers for food stamps or a cold burger at some point just resonated with me not sure if it fits the narrative the schizophrenia idea is fairly solid as the viewpoint that other people could have of him he could be interfering with a heavenhell balance meaning that lucifer gets annoyed because god´s favourite toys are killing his men and god gets annoyed because one of his creations is unnaturally killing his other creations but he cant intervene too much because of free will monsters or even lucifer shows up expecting the homeless man to be terrified but the things this man has seen either real or not have been far worse so he is not afraid the short was good i wish you fortune in the future
television,removed,i checked out of the show at the end of last season im just tired of it and its bullshit and the bullshit from the writers and producers just like you also its a horribly written show i understand its a work of fiction set in a postapocalyptic world overrun by zombies and that im supposed to suspend disbelief but i cant suspend disbelief in the amount that they require to like their show every episode its the same shit somebody that should know better completely fucked up and now shit happens again yay just like last week more dumb shit i dont expect ricks group to act like a delta force team but at this point they just keep making dumb mistakes over and over again and the only reason its part of the story is so that the writers can keep moving the plot forward
television,removed,ahh bb cost million an episode to make thats almost an entire season of a show in australia im not denying some of ur points but when some of our shows only have or so viewers and are still lauded as some of the best tv around ill take that over the shows in the us made every week i love my shitty us shows too though except arrowcause felcity fucked that show so hard

television,removed,for me its anything where the protagonists need to be in good physical condition just to survive theres a good amount of running in the walking dead they may be walking but there are thousands of them battles with the sword and the battle axe are great too vikings rome spartacus and the like kept me running as i pictured myself getting cut short in those battles if i didnt have the stamina to continue

television,removed,jews are not white the discrimination against the white gentiles in hollywood is blatant when half of hollywood actors are jewish gentiles have to do porn if they want acting jobs in hollywood
television,removed,couldnt agree with you more while the animation was gorgeous and season is right up there with atla season as far as best season in the series korra left a lot lacking storywise i think one of the biggest reasons why is because korra lost the head writer from the original show aaron ehasz seriously look him up on the avatar wiki he wrote all of the season finales and tentpoles episodes like the storm and the day of black sun he and his wife elizabeth made huge contributions to the mythology of the show mike and bryan are artists by training not writers and i think that really showed in korra particularly season since they wrote that one all by themselves the characters were a lot more formulaic and it was much harder to relate to them i liked korra enough and thats mainly because of season but it doesnt really hold a candle to atla imo

television,removed,the norwegian show is so good everyone needs to watch it like a currentday skins but more relatable httpskamonlinetumblrcomepisodes
television,removed,i know that idiot your original comment basically boils down to a passive aggressive way of saying there is nothing wrong with the show there is something wrong with you to which i say go fuck yourself you arrogant douche
television,removed,finale gave the fans more than they couldve asked for
television,removed,what even taken by itself and out of context it doesnt make any reference to heritage if provided full context he is talking about illegal immigration but even out of context when mexico sends its people aka immigrants

television,removed,this
television,removed,glad to see they have the balls to take out a fan favorite does anyone know if this next season is the last theyre just holding good actors hostage at this point
television,removed,its hardly speculation its glen the guy that plays him is signed up to make a movie while everyone else is making the next season of twd id bet its glen
television,removed,and its freaking pointless speculation its not pointless speculation the actor that plays glen is off making a movie instead of making the next season of twd so not really complicated
television,removed,im not even going to pretend this is some secret that should be protected its fucking glen
television,removed,its fucking glen this isnt a spoiler everyone knows its glen
television,removed,yeah i was highly disappointed that they pussied out with that cliffhanger we deserved that devastating crushing feeling followed by the credits with no music like when jon snow died

television,removed,reddit is great once you filter out that shit subreddit
television,removed,dude youre fucking stupid its the people he believed he followed that inspired him to do this not his god if it was then why arent all muslims going out and killing anyone who didnt agree with them obviously this is a fucking tragedy and its sad to see innocent lives have been took by a mindless brainwashed person but please for the sake of the victims dont take this opportunity to speak your bigotted mind and even more sadly get upvoted for it
television,removed,educate yourself about islam islam is the cause of this attack
television,removed,wait until people are afraid to speak against islam sounds familiar wait until people are afraid to be open about their sexuality in front of muslims wait until people get killed for disobeying shariah law terrorist attacks are concentrated in the middle east but they are spreading farther and farther people getting desensitized will only bring hidden fear that cant be overcome because no one else is speaking out due to the fear they might offend the peaceful majority most germans were peaceful most japanese were peaceful most russians were peaceful most chinese were peaceful most cambodians were peaceful islam countries has a radical population that is a huge number the islam population is growing at max speed also
television,removed,imagine john oliver has a solid pupil and he still avoids using it to preach about what islam really is an antiquated brutal ideology that has no place in the modern world neither in west nor in the middle east nowhere im an iranian atheist and i have been prosecuted for my atheism before and i was planning on immigrating to west long before this happened now it seems impossible people just dont differentiate between atheists from middle easts and muslims from there i believe muslims are a bunch of wifebeating daughterkilling brutes who deserve to be nuked if theyd let me relocate my family and myself into a safezone i would gladly push the big red button to nuke the shit out of the middle east and then i would line up every muslim in western countries and shoot them in the head they have no right making life hell for everyone around them

television,removed,no youre going to have to point out all the horrendous comments and why i should be horrified by them
television,removed,the worst part is that all sorts of ideology marketers and public opinion mongers jump on it and in a couple of hours a huge part of the conversation was about gun control background checks mental health immigration religion and gender pretty much every divisive social issue that has been turned into a political issue by all sides our marketing and pr people are being played by terrorists who are using our own media to drive these wedges between us yeah we should react ant protect ourselves but we also should make an effort to stop harming ourselves like that
television,removed,yea i mean when you have a sitting president and a all but confirmed nominee both making statements both applauding australian confiscation as well as proposals like removing rights because youre on a secret list because you sought financial assistance because you receive a social security check because you live in public housing because someone accused you of being sucical because you smoked weed thats legal in your state because they dont like the color and shape of your gun im the crazy one

television,removed,i watched this movie a year or so ago off of recommendation honestly such a fun watch also really brings you back to the time it was made and elements of the film and its futurism are very relatable to today great watch
television,removed,well if we had only known that the glasssteygul act was destroyed and what it would do and if we had known that billerys crime bill would fill prisons with low income people so shillery can collect money from private prisons later or that he would go on to form a foundation and sell guns for contributions by having his sos wife override humanitarian concerns to countries still stoning and burning women yeah if only we had known then what we know now

television,removed,beyond was fantastic it wasnt classic trek but i feel like it captured the spirits of at least the better movies it was fun plot made sense respected the history of the franchise and strayed away from the problems of the previous film the reboot is great too this is basically a different property but as a huge fan of the shows and original movies i have no problem admitting i love of the new movies even stid isnt as bad as the worst star trek movies before them

television,removed,im not a smart viewer for shows that have details like this had i watched brba live i would have missed out on so much and gotten frustrated with it but i am glad i didnt come across the theory of him being the in prison this whole time on the sub because it would have ruined the moment for me a lot like in twd s with the comic readers ruining negan and lucille and possibly glenns fate something didnt seem right when elliot mentioned in the first few episodes of this season order and discipline after living with his mom the guy woke up made his bed etc had a strict routine that seemed almost military rather than something he decided to try in a selfhelp book or through his counselor but that was about as much as i picked up on the hints the scene at the end where his counselor asks where do you think you are right now really caught me by surprise and then the slow reveal in the form of a before and after format of characters and setting was just mind blowing it actually felt like a season finale the way it sort of left on a cliffhanger of that magnitude it was great i had no qualms with this second season like many viewers did but this episode took it from a solid plateau and up a few notches
television,removed,shame you seem to be an exmember of having a brain club

television,removed,i blame the fact that latinos are stupidly obsessed with god which makes no sense at all because the christiancatholic spanish conquistadors raped the fuck out of their ancestors
television,removed,it really sucks that everyone is so quick to get bent out of shape over everything its a sitcom it might have been funny might have sucked but to pull the plug because of some pissed off tweets is shitty all were left with is horrible sitcoms with token gays and trannys everywhere it doesnt represent real life at all
television,removed,ed hardy and kissing dogs is that really a stereotype people from a lot of different backgrounds wear ed hardy and kiss dogs
television,removed,it happens everywhere the idea thats its even a bad thing or that it should be called a fetishism is very american
television,removed,just finished the whole series the fight scenes had potential especially with the whole environmental destruction going on but dear lord does anything think this suffers from the same terrible flaw jessica jones has namely boring slowpaced talkmoreshowless scenes about characters that you can barely give a fuck about and that are being dragged cottonmouths actor in the first few episodes made you feel like you really want to see him in more diverse scenes where he shows you more range then suddenly barely halfway through he dies and is swapped out for a diamondback clown who just hates luke cagecarl lucas because jealousy over daddys love and this is all done through boring dialogue where i could hardly keep up to what the hell made diamondback want to frame and eventually turn on luke like seriously we never even saw the catalyst that made diamondback be lukes villain what the fuck and how did diamondback even get the bullets needed to penetrate luke how did he even know luke was impenetrable and those bullets would work good lord i hope there wont be a season save it for daredevil season punisher please
television,removed,ouch
television,removed,what hispanics are you talking to the ones i meet where all about kissing dogs if anything it the dog was considered part of the family anyway its buzzfeed their stuff is dumb as rocks dont pay attention the them
television,removed,this thread is like a train wreck my buddy is marrying a girl he met in china there is zero percent chance anyone is being forced to come over here against their will unless theyre being snuck in aboard cargo ships like some cheesy police drama the paperwork they have to go through just to start the marriage makes getting gay married look like a walk in the park so many interviews and forms to fill out and they specifically ask about payforplay arrangements multiple times reddits upvotes work like a wishitweretrue meter for these idiots
television,removed,
television,removed,bro they do over the phone and in person interviews with both partners together and separately multiple times in addition to a mountain of paperwork if at any point in this process it looks like shes there to prostitute or there against her will the process stops and she is deported even once theyre married theyre subject to a probationary period where her green card can be revoked this aint something that you can slip the border agent an envelop full of cash and make go away government takes this shit very seriously

television,removed,for your information theres a whole world outside of the united states billions of people the vast majority of these people have no clue who is iron fist or luke cage even less jessica jones im pretty sure they dont give a shit that those are comic book adaptations it could be an original story for all they know stop being si fucking ethnocentric
television,removed,horseshit most fat people that lose a ton of weight gain it all back again last i checked the only way to gain weight by having a dick inside you is to get pregnant it wasnt the sexual assault it was the twinkies slathered in butter and pancake syrup
television,removed,but thats just the thing luke cage is physically invulnerable but look how distraught he was about the death of pops particularly the idea that pops might have been killed by a bullet ricocheing off his impenetrable skin i also think he carries the weight with him of having to lift up his community the social issues that the show focuses on gives it an added level of relevance imho
television,removed,this morning i ate bowls of apple jacks and then i took a shit in my pants

television,removed,this show here is a piece of fucking shit its the single worst show on television passing itself of as a childrens show its feminist and homosexual propaganda on top of being programming for wittols you want languid pieces of useless shit for sons let them watch this fucking nonsense fuck rebecca sugar and her hellbound show i look forward to all that piece of shit rotting in hell
television,removed,
television,removed,this show is the absolute worst rebecca throws out love as her shieldword to excuse her subversive homosexualtransgender emasculating feminist bullshit this is what happens when you use your talents for evil im upset with cn for putting this show on and for marketing it towards kids its really a low down dirty shame
television,removed,su is an evil show its that simple not only because it exists but mainly because they market it to kids to confuse and indoctrinate them
television,removed,its indoctrinating them into homosexuality transgenderism and perpetuating the emasculation of the american male its an evil show
television,removed,how is any of that bad how is it hurting people if none of that is bad to you then weve basically come to a pass its just like with the drug debate youre either for it or against it im against homosexual indoctrination transgender confusion and the emasculation of the american male so im fundamentally against rebecca sugar and her show and its fans
television,removed,ha how ironic i hope rebecca doesnt either and i wish she couldnt adopt kids to brainwash as awell
television,removed,in the last years love between the same sex has became more common im not saying this to sound like im anti gay or anti lesbian or whatever you call the acronym for such even if i sound like it but my concern here is these children there are some five year olds watching out there who are looking at the girls dating and probably saying thats weird i thought only boys and girls dated and that leads to a uncomfortable talk with the parent i just cant help but feel uncomfortable with the opposite sex dating on the show being exposed to kids the kids are my one and only concern here as ive sad a bunch of times even if my point doesnt get across in a good way or a way anyone understand just know i dont like the opposite sex dating and it being exposed to kids ive personally never watched this show so i wasnt sure necessarily what was on it
television,removed,david tennant was also the only good part of jessica jones and his punishment for not sucking was to die
television,removed,
television,removed,they edit out some of the subtle cuckolding shit rebecca tried to pull off in one particular episode kids would have found it odd but anyone with a frame of reference couldnt mistake what rebecca was going for this show really is a piece of shit
television,removed,lol the creator aint bi that shits a lie for sure
television,removed,no look the shit up yourself and if you know the su episode then you know what im talking aboutwhich is why it got censored in the first place you dimwit
television,removed,yeah and youre a moron if you think that television programming doesnt play a huge role in shaping society as a whole and dont start with that pussy shit the only pussies are the ones who like this piece of shit show

television,removed,were going to deliver you something fantastic nbsp yeah i wasnt convinced either fuck you gimple
television,removed,oh right thats it not because it looks like whiny pedantic bullshit
television,removed,your comment is empty nonresponsive garbage
television,removed,i didnt like it tulip as the manic badgirl is a nonstop cringe fest good fucking lord jesse makes no sense its back and forth between thug and preacher for him with no explanation what is his characterization right now cassidys chainsaw fight scene was cool but like literally everything else in the show no one watching understands why on earth its happening ipad rage woman serves no purpose other than to be a nagging jealous drag on every scene shes in why is she in this show ending on a cliff hanger like they did is a cheap trick that shitty shows and pulpy novels do to keep people coming back seconds more would make the difference between holy shit his power let him do that this is getting interesting and wow i guess ill really have to tune in or else i wont know what happened i liked the comic spoilers s saint of killers backstory beginning although i know that they got rid of the blizzard for budget concerns if i werent a comic reader it wouldnt be a tiny bit of sense why its included though more comic spoilery kind of comments s the whole silent blank expression deadpan person imitating a human portrayal of the two trying to recover genesis was cliched and hackney as fuck i miss the mixture of religious mythology and sick humor in their portrayal from the comic assuming they were the adephi or something in a similar role i really dont want them to be a slave to the comic but the problem is that the comic has a much better story it starts off with his ability and then it launches into the plot around it all of this slow burning different plot lines and slowly uncovering what it means is just boring or at least how theyre doing it is boring its not so much that its a comic vs show issue for me its like the hobbit trilogy they made something different that sucked game of thrones has made something different that arguably improved on many of the shortcomings of its source so i welcome those changes the comic was good because of ennis fucked up humor and oddball action that keeps me guessing what crazy shit ill read in the next issue maybe if they shape this plot into something interesting ill get on board but right now im or episodes from quitting it if i hadnt read the comic i wouldnt have watched the second episode
television,removed,why are you so angry how old are you it seems like you cannot take criticisms without juvenile and angry personal attacks in retaliation

television,removed,we expect people to be able to converse agree and disagree without making it personal or being a jerk about the entire experience thats fantastic what a great rule the guy i responded to was condescending and rude are you his sock puppet
television,removed,trying to save their feminist propaganda show by any means necessary this femnazi satire exploding on cbs and now in desperation theyre bending the tvdceu rules to bring on superman so he can be subjected to this feminist nonsense all to save a tired ass piece of programming that is has been bent on not needing him men this entire time pathetic its bad enough this awful hag is ruining the cw with her bullshit now here comes superman to save her day too
television,removed,its worth noting that its the three together who are entertainement gold but not from day this new show has more viewers than the first shows with clarkson and hammond and clarkson was and you can easily see if you look on youtube absolutely fucking hopeless when he first started presenting top gear so if anything these guys are off to much better start they have when you include iplayer et al a significantly bigger audience and they are nowhere near as bad as the others of course they are not as good as the presenters ended up being but even that schtick was starting to grow old and predictable i doubt the amazon prime show will be massively popular unless clarkson hammond and may come up with something fresh not the least because for the majority of the uk public theyll have to pay a subscription to watch it
television,removed,yeah its quite pathetic really an experienced celebrity acting like that after each episode just seems so childish his publicist needs to tell him to stfu

television,removed,thats not a feature anymore whats the point of having our history visible then
television,removed,oh lawd is cye for real coming back

television,removed,oh you mean how all the frogs complained about obama for years karma is a bitch motherfucker
television,removed,the flawed voting system protects smaller less populated or less important in the minds of coastal liberals from having their needs and concerns steamrolled at every opportunity its a part of federalism and the us is built on federalism and freedom of speech does not protect one from being called out for acting like a spoiled child who has just bern told that he cant have ice cream for dinner
television,removed,or in this situation we all lose
television,removed,nate silver is that you
television,removed,i hope they also run those atrocious commercials with the celebrities singing i will survive and the ones where they pleaded with electors to change their minds no matter how funny some of the trump material may be nothing will be more hilarious than watching those out of touch self important entitled celebrity brats in their huge circle jerk
television,removed,opium should be legal too it has been used medicinally and recreationally for thousands of years the government has no role in telling people what to put in their bodies
television,removed,europe funds their social policies with money they save on not having a military because america keeps them safe

television,removed,most of u dumbasses didnt even read the comics everyone saying skippable episodes but those skippable episodes are the table setters that whole tara episode plays a big part in the upcoming season half in the comics its only mentioned of oceanside but we get to actually see it as for the show being pussied for the viewers is straight bullshit its because of the sponsors they want a more eclectic fan base more people to watch their commercials as for this last first half season it was the best andrew lincoln acting was oscar worthy and jdm does the best he could with the character because its so limited everyone bitches and complains but then again what have you done with your life now go cry like a bitch to the mods and down vote me bitches
television,removed,i thought it was kind of nice though how it seems to put less emphasis on the circumstances of his death and focus entirely on his career

television,removed,i wish we would take that shit to cnn and burn their shit down
television,removed,same with runcensorednews my patience ran out when it became evident that they think alex jones to be a perfectly reasonable guy especially when its some sort of dirt on hillary or bernie or whothefuckever isnt trump
television,removed,they were actively targeting white people i guess when a black cop shoots a black criminal in a predominately black neighborhood its the fault of racist white people
television,removed,its so sad watching people try so hard to be victimized indeed you dumbass
television,removed,she
television,removed,lol trumpfags out in full force
television,removed,how has there not been a pic of a liquor store pawn shop and check cashing place with the title they burning down shit we need im disappointed in you internet
television,removed,n words going to n word
television,removed,but something like of blacks vote democrat why however do you think they have been turned off by the rhetoric of the republican party as well ive talked to black people who believe welfare needs major reform want a curtail on immigration and desire a solution for radical islam however the very last person they want trying to fix those issues is donald trump another bush or a dominionism christian like ted cruz i know the left has its problems but ive grown tired of the conservatives republicans and right wingers always throwing the blame of todays culture problems at the liberal left its no different than the liberal left always blaming racism for todays problems
television,removed,ah yes sling some insults that will totally solidify your argument
television,removed,oy vey shut it down
television,removed,they have always
television,removed,are you fucking stupid

television,removed,im white and i find your post very offensive i certainly wouldnt want to live in your neighborhood full of cowboys your bigotry shows at least try and cover it up
television,removed,bitch should be hung from a tree for threatening the lives of thousands fucking terrorists
television,removed,this post is cancer delete it
television,removed,we agree a lot i would do the same but the hatred speech on both sides trumps and this ladys left and right that taunts invites and trivializes violence solves nothing and makes things worst maybe our best is to stop saying things that amplify conflict and violence and not hesitate to defend peace and our property with our actions however we must stand by our police and make rotten apples accountable acknowledge racism and condemn violent speech defend gun rights persuading with good arguments and condemn those that propose using violence or money to do it
television,removed,lmao youre a fucking idiot and proved my point
television,removed,eat my dick
television,removed,youre a bigot and and a bully
television,removed,eat my dick you fucking internet commentor lameo

television,removed,how the goddamn fuck is this a protest you obtuse motherfucker
television,removed,either way she thinks the suburbs is some kind of wealthy utopia and that burning it down will somehow help the black plight she thinks middle class americans deserve to have their shit burned down because her neighborhood is full of shit heads and btw stop playing fucking dumb you really think she didnt mean white neighborhoods take your bullshit somewhere else

television,removed,of the four youre all gay
television,removed,but we do have black politicians and reporters etc these things arent very scarce especially considering the hurdles black men and women have to face to get in those spots seeing the true face of this subreddit i know im going to be downvoted for saying this but the system in place is against blacks this is held up by many many statistics and this system is held in place obviously by the people who benefit from it it is a black vs white issue and to brush that aside is to ignore history and enable this corrupt culture being able to get to a certain place doesnt negate how unfair and difficult it was to get there saying we just need to change our culture and stop the bullshit is very naive and disingenuous cuz i can just say the same thing but direct it to white people instead and then how can you say my statement is less valid then yours
television,removed,you are such a worthless piece of garbage
television,removed,you have the best words
television,removed,my penis is decensortized

television,removed,i think you are wrong i dont advocate censorship cnn should be legally free to air whatever with that freedom comes the ethical obligation to consider the impact of what they choose to publish it applies to incitation of violence suicide acts of terrorism etc it should be legal to publish and it may also be wrong to do so

television,removed,damn dude it was just a silly tv show how come it meant that much to you genuine question not trying to be a jerk i hope you find a new show or something else that made you as happy as that show did
television,removed,imho its all on his writing teams they were the worst in the panels basically only saying shit for laughs even if someone had made a solid serious point the only time everyone on the panel was on the same page was with anything sjw related then it just became and irredeemable circle jerk there were moments for each person where they shined but overall the staff they chose to be on air were terrible choices valdez and ramsey were by far the worst mike yard and holly walker were the best

television,removed,i wonder if it was hard for her to only have expression and word dialog throughout the whole season i am more interested how they got the down syndrome kid in the trucker hat to remember all his lines that kid deserves an emmy he was the only kid that i enjoyed watching on screen especially since he overcame so much with his obvious disability to perform as well as he did winona ryder seemed like she was playing her character from heathers at times the other star the evil scientist seemed like he has acted the same part he has played a few times before too the chief of police was my favorite character in the show
television,removed,bill was the one who was the idiot there because he didnt even understand what she was asking oh he knew but he seemed rather done with being the butt of the jokes at that point if she was going to act dumb he was going to treat her as ignorant you think bill hasnt done a million this is your weight on mars type skits he knew what she was asking but had a chance to make her look like a fool i think youre the one who doesnt understand what was happening there
television,removed,im baaaack

television,removed,fuck off dude seriously go cry about it whining on reddit is not going to change anything good luck
television,removed,okay lets lean into this off putting conversation then the difference between that racebaiting host and people who want to move forward is how they see differences es between groups of people ie economic educational criminal differences measurable differences racebaiters automatically kneejerk to saying these differences have to be explained by an exterior reason outside the group aka racism and discrimination while in reality you know whats holding blacks in ghettos down shit personal decisions dependency on government welfare and a counterproductive culture that discourages education hardwork thrift lawful behavior and instead says talk like an idiot dont respect the law dont be responsible for your actions violence over words is cool and blame and ostracize anyone who criticizes this shit culture asracist why do blacks from the caribbean and africa come to the united states and graduate from college and do financially much better than native black americans because they arent brainwashed with the regressive black redneck culture that was originally transplanted from england to the south in the then to northern cities in the early when southern blacks started moving into the black communities of northern cities even the black people who had been educated and brought up in the north during the didnt want anything to do with the loud rude and violent black rednecks that moved into their communities and subsequently helped destroy them there is another class of coloured people who make a business of keeping the troubles the wrongs and the hardships of the negro race before the public having learned that they are able to make a living out of their troubles they have grown into the settled habit of advertising their wrongs — partly because they want sympathy and partly because it pays some of these people do not want the negro to lose his grievances because they do not want to lose their jobs booker t washington said this over years ago and its still true today and white liberals and academics are also to blame for saying this shit gangster and redneck culture is the authentic black culture and defending it and smearing and slandering anyone who dares stand up and counter the orthodoxy that says acting like a thug is ones culture and should be left alone

television,removed,because whats the difference between your bubble and the nazi bubbles there is no objective truth or morality we cant from the outside decide that someone is wrong or someone is right all we can do is share ideas and the ones that are good for society will gain traction and the bad ones will be fade away ideally that is but there will always be bubbles that keep what could be considered generally outdated ways of thinking alive we have to mix the bubbles or are you afraid yours will pop if exposed to the opinion of others
television,removed,this explains it better than i could i understand their reasons i dont think they voted because they hate muslims or whatever it could be because their coal town has no jobs but the thing he said and the things he proposed were still not dealbreakers or significant issues for them and many times it will affect my life when trump goes downhill much more than it will affect them

television,removed,because nobody thinks theyre the bad guy understanding and learning different points of view can help you grow as a person and learn about those that you disagree with while still viewing then as humans for example im sure in your community the theme of love everyone flows around have you ever really talked to someone that was fundamentally against gay marriage to the point that you could respect them and their opinion and still have them around on a daily basis if we dont reach outside of our bubble every once in awhile it becomes very easy to dehumanize the others and consider all of their opinions invalid
television,removed,disgusting

television,removed,thank you ianal
television,removed,it felt like a waste of time for me personally but a lot of people like it frankly unless youve watched everything else theres better shit to watch first season of lost is amazing starts to go downhill after that and the finale was one of the biggest disappointments in tv history for me lazy predictable and most importantly the people involved in the show promised they wouldnt go that direction with it because it was too easycheesy
television,removed,csgo rust and pcmr of course you think breaking bad has the best ending you fucking child
television,removed,username checks out
television,removed,no the ending was fucking stupid all the characters you know eventually die and meet each other somehow and move on together meanwhile half the season you just watched meant nothing because its not their real livesstoriesit was a dumb season of once smart characters doing dumb things
television,removed,i am a person like yourself that waited until just last fall to watch lost my friends hyped lost saying it was the best show ever made we binge watched the series over a month and i have to say that i personally did not think it was worth near that hype i found myself getting pissed about every other episode being a flashback episode so when they started introducing new characters i got pissed because i knew what was coming another flashback i wanted them to just move forward to solve whatever mysteries i had actually guessed correctly eventually they switch it up with giving you flashforwards i found myself only liking the scottish time knight and despising pretty much all the main characters the show is ok in small doses dont get me wrong but the story late in the series is pushed onto you they clearly ran out of things to do and i believe it was after the infamous writers strike during that period that did it in if you dont get into it after the first few episodes i would not bother because that is what the whole series will be like until late in the series
television,removed,ad block on
television,removed,
television,removed,lmfao so many triggered snowflakes in this thread hillary lost because she was the worst candidate in the history of the us and her and her criminalinchief bill crimes were finally exposed to the public why do you think the liberal media is suddenly crying about wikileaks the democratic slime finally got rejected and like the sore losers they are cant handle it and are throwing tantrums and blaming everyone else but their crooked candidate sad keep this up and youll get more years of trump lmfao

television,removed,at the end of season we found out that the good place is not heaven but hell
television,removed,but thats the point of my post you can literally apply all of that to lost plot all went downhill when they had no idea what to do with the hatch and the others listen to podcasts and interviews with lindelof and cuse they have no idea what theyre doing and handwave away any criticisms for this jj abrams patented mystery box nonsense same reason i hated the ending of cloverfield lane would have been perfect without that bullshit fight character development henry is a bad person until he conveniently chooses not to be the man in black is literally classic jj abrams with the subtlety of a brick through a window hurley does uh hurley things jin and sun leave their baby because le island and then orphan her same with said jack is a fuckboy who nearly gets everyone killed to satisfy his god complex charlie and desmond are the only good arcs on that show and the former got to exit out right before the quality nosedived after season what im getting at is that these characters developed due to the plot going off the rails and not organically everyone is the season was a dumbass and i hated them all thats not ad hominem because it was literally unbelievable foreshadowing yeah it had foreshadowing but i was praying it wasnt leading off to the ending ending my god the mother of stupid endings lindelof and cuse swore up and down the island wasnt purgatory and no one was dead well i guess they technically werent lying but my god what a copout the flashsideways are purgatory these people are going to heaven together so thats what the show was about i literally cant believe the abc execs didnt eviscerate these two when they pitched that ending and just in case you think im overreacting it seems that in hindsight a lot of people are taking the same positions i am httpsenwikipediaorgwikitheendlostreflectivereviews yes lost was revolutionary and a lot of shows owe a lot to it and it was inventive for network tv but my god did it just derail like it just crossed the river kwai have a good day

television,removed,the show was good until the last coupla when the monster cgi was just ludicrous felt was watching the scifi channel the show was really great in straddling a story about kids but still make it adult watchable until then good news is it has reignited my interest in xfiles which this borrowed quite a bit from soundtrack was probably the best part of this show
television,removed,its a tough question to address because essentially all shows and movies are filler they entertain those who are entertained by them and what you consider filler in one show someone else will consider the whole point of the show you either care about the story being told and the way it is told or you dont and move on to a different show but it cannot be all car chases and explosions all the time because that too turns into filler where the story is not being told you need conversations character development every day events and so on if you want to have a realistic story if that stuff bores you then watch cartoons or porn
television,removed,so
television,removed,now fetch his dentures you black thief props to those who get the ep reference

television,removed,i told myself one more episode of bojack and im going to bed went to bed feeling like i never got that last episode in then again i tend to also feel that way if an episode is really good
television,removed,we all have done this its just that most of us have the luxury of not being famous every black person i ever talked to doesnt care he did it and yes i get that i have not talked to every single black person in the world but i do live in atlanta and a strong portion of my friends are black and i was personally surprised buy their uniform appreciation for the guy ive def called a person a nigger before when i was really pissed off i mean the dude was white but still i shouldnt be using that language
television,removed,they definitely explained the polar bears you probably werent paying attention and in regards to walt the writers had a story for him but all that had to sort of get kicked out the window when the actor was growing too rapidly that would not fit with the shows time frame so they had to ditch that plot case of bad luck
television,removed,why does this crap get upvoted is this all the cuckservatives can do play their both sides are bad game to deflect from the topic here

television,removed,its amazing how elizabeth smart saw through her fake concern asking about if she wanted to scream for help ask if she was scared then as you said would appreciate a victim to speak to inspire other people but understands why she wouldnt want to talk about it she is far wiser beyond her years at such a young age she wasnt baited into the fear mongering of such nancy grace grace wanted to embellish on the fears and scares but nope smart was there to talk about something else she wasnt having it grace deserves to be shut down

television,removed,yeahno we already have too much of this shit on tv put it on bet where it belongs
television,removed,of course but i think at some point he took over his social media himself either that or hes forcing his social media staff to post his shit verbatim because no one can possibly be that retarded to tweet that kind of campaignendingly stupid shit at on the other side of the coin hillarys social media team is laughable at best they tried too hard and the whole delete ur account thing was just sad

television,removed,yeah i remember i watched it few years ago here is its original link httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvjwmslrainno first upload here
television,removed,yeah i am not at all for one minute saying he is a great president but coming from a previous president who just sat around fucking up the countrys image to the world looking at u w but he is far better than bush or reagan ever where and its pretty hard to shake the boat when congress is in the pocket of lobbyists and the nra so nothing can ever change i mean that speech of his after sandy hook pretty much sums up us congressional systemi want to make it harder for people to get guns but i will never be allowed to as the nra just has to much juice trys to get the american healthcare system into better shape than it was and gets lambasted for it meh oh well he is pretty much gone now if the us votes trump in gg china will be running the global economy the next day as what the markets take a piss
television,removed,the people who control the news the jews this is a fact look it up
television,removed,every network media outlet etc is owned by the jews and most producers etc are jewish like i said look it up why are they manipulating media i dont know but this is a factual statement
television,removed,he should follow her into deathl
television,removed,i cant stick up for trump but bill maher is a complete twat
television,removed,if nonamericans are confused as to why donald trump has a chance to win it has a lot to do with the fact that immigrants like jon oliver can come here and earn millions by doing nothing but shit on america
television,removed,ooh i made a typo and added an f i might as well be a psychotic serial rapist
television,removed,it didnt help though
television,removed,michael rosenbaum made smallville worth watching and did a great flash voiceover in this show
television,removed,he certainly enjoys when technology makes things work in a better way though this is an excellent rectangle
television,removed,more like scripting to automate tasks and monitor network traffic when i think programming i tend to think of software creation
television,removed,i love trevor noah on the daily show but im a bit biased because i loved him as a comedian beforehand so now i just love him in general his interview with tomi lahren was fantastic he handled it flawlessly if nothing else just watch that
television,removed,arya kills him
television,removed,no they didnt i think youre mixing up the fact that matt groening named springfield after springfield oregon with the show actually taking place there there is no canon answer theyve made it a deliberate point to make every possibility impossible when they aired an episode that directly stated which state springfield was in behind the laughter they went to the trouble of providing different copies to different affiliates and rotating them on rerun so that it would say kentucky one airing idaho another airing new york another airing etc for the dvds the audio says kentucky while the subtitles say missouri any time they need to show springfield on a map they put it in a different place often in a place that doesnt physically exist eg a landmass jutting out of florida its one of their longest running jokes dan greaney had a checklist up in the writers room so they could be sure to rule out every possible state which they did and they kept encouraging fans to try to figure it out anyway theres an episode where lisa explains that if you follow the clues you can figure out where they live the episode were on the road to dohwhere is about a multiday road trip from springfield to oregon matt groening i dont want to ruin it for people you know whenever people say its springfield ohio or springfield massachusetts or springfield wherever i always go yup thats right i also figured out that springfield was one of the most common names for a city in the us i thought this will be cool everyone will think its their springfield and they do
television,removed,all of the starks die tho
television,removed,i thought some scripts leaked for next season or maybe it was for both although im not sure if they were real but warning anyway l
television,removed,httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvigaixsbaba
television,removed,without clicking on the link theres no spoiler so either you clicked the link knowing it was about game of thrones and you fucked up or youre complaining about nothing and can go eat a dick
television,removed,its the targaryen version of snow a bastards last name
television,removed,oh thanks for the clarification
television,removed,fat ginger makes no sense since he had the intent to shut her down blackmail is no tangible threat if you have the remote control
television,removed,here we go
television,removed,it is lazy storytelling but it might be good film making if they used it to good effect they made a character that never seemed to be in any real danger she never seemed like she could lose luke seemed like he was just a few minutes away from getting eaten sliced shot or similar he also lost his hand at one point sure he got it reattached its the future but the whole scene was a giant defeat the hero literally lost and got severely hurt where is the similar scene in any recent movie how have they specifically failed like the flawed heros
television,removed,i meant reattached for the purposes of storytelling there is no limitation placed on him by the hand it doesnt run out of battery it isnt slower limited in motion or disabled by remote it is generally just written off as a nonfactor after the defeat
television,removed,
television,removed,lol
television,removed,sad
television,removed,well at least its renewed until season
television,removed,how did it feel like that lol i dont know it just did then maybe you should bother learning his fuckin name dude btw its mike alright mike jesus fuck what do you want from me i feel like your my ex who is yelling at me over something but is secretly plotting to kill me because the toilet paper roll was put on backwards but you wont tell me about the toilet paper what is the toilet paper in your mind right now
television,removed,thanks fam
television,removed,still ashamed i used to call myself a liberal progressive leftism is a mental disorder and its even worse now with the social justice disease and the victim cult warping it all
television,removed,way to be fam
television,removed,i dont think trump sees seth as irrelevant which made trump put seth on his blacklist
television,removed,bush used to be director of the cia he ran as regans vp pick william casey who was the cia director at the time negotiated a deal with iran to hold american hostages until the election in order to get carter out of office there is evidence that bush attended some of these meetings as well but thats another story reagan gets elected and the hostages are released on the same day of course these events are officially unconnected then in return the whitehouse goes against the arms embargo and starts supplying the iranian contras with illegal weapons again not officially connected to the hostage deal plane loads of weapons are being taken down into nicaragua since you now have an empty plane to fly home why not bring something valuable back and thats what they did tons and tons of cocaine the planes were flown by people like barry seal and the planes landed in a small town called mena arkansas guess who was governor of arkansas at the time when you have that much drugs and that much drug money how do you launder it from here its a much longer story but involves shady government agencies that were set up like the arkansas development and finance authority to give loans to companies like parkonmeter who were supposed to be making parking meters but were actually making warheads and weapons for the contras its actually way more involved and complex than all of this but enough time has passed that there is tons of information out there from people who were involved in these things heres an older documentary on the mena drug running if youre interested
television,removed,he wasnt diagnosed until years after he left office im not saying it had no effect on him but it obviously wasnt too bad at the time
television,removed,idk i was too young
television,removed,viciously racist views arent really unique but i think how committed he was to them sets him apart from the rest like say nixon who at least tried to hide it it took the tapes to hear him say negroes are like dogs jews are this and that etc reagan was a dedicated race wаrrior and very vocal about it he was the original promulgator of hysteria about single black mothers parasitizing the government httpsenwikipediaorgwikiwelfarequeen a champion of the drug war architected by nice folks like these look we understood we couldnt make it illegal to be young or poor or black in the united states but we could criminalize their common pleasure we understood that drugs were not the health problem we were making them out to be but it was such a perfect issue that we couldnt resist it john ehrlichman white house counsel to the president emphasized that you have to face the fact that the whole problem is really the blacks the key is to devise a system that recognizes this while not appearing to h r haldeman white house chief of staff it cracks me up a bit when people talk about the failed drug war when looking at its aims it was actually extremely successful
television,removed,oh right your full of shit got it
television,removed,i read anal
television,removed,and they completely fucked the into of said negan buy blue balling the audience with that shit cliff hanger me and my friends are officially done with twd ill read online who gets killed by the bat coughglencough
television,removed,this is my only post in this thread i was just scrolling through and was surprised by how aggressively negative you are are you lonely or something desperately searching for any kind of human interaction
television,removed,you can watch it httpwwwwatchcartoononlinecomanimegravityfalls
television,removed,misleading article but seriously this dude is super boring matt leblanc is pretty good though and its not because hes the american in the group and chris isnt i actually had a conversation with my mom a week or so ago about how bad chris is and how good matt is and she was saying its because nobody knows who chris is and everybody knows who matt is i said uhh you know that show is on bbc right its not an american show she figured since friends was such a huge hit that everybody in the world knows who matt leblanc is but since she doesnt know who chris evans is in california that nobody in the uk probably knows who he is either it made no fucking sense she loves the original trio on top gear but she didnt know who any of them were before she watched that show with them on it but now acts as if everybody knows who they are because she knows who they are

television,removed,the one and only thing that bugged me was george saying literally i just cant see that i dont recall him ever saying it on the show and its just not very george the line pg literally the least we could do should be changed into something like ah cmon forget about it oh please pssh its the least we could do
television,removed,
television,removed,i dont have tv too use the internet whenever i have to watch anything i searched about watching olympics online and found httpswwwivacycomblogwatcholympicsonline it covers almost everything about watching olympics for cord cutters
television,removed,no one wants to see scifi they want vampires and housewives
television,removed,stranger things shills have been out in force lately
television,removed,its not the industry that sucks its your average person they dont want to think critically about their shows they want to be entertained in very basic ways people ruin everything and make it hard to buy the things i want second hand because they all have shit taste except for a few million or two
television,removed,happy birthday to gabe
television,removed,just because its a popular circlejerk right now doesnt necessarily mean its really that good i liked it and i did get the nostalgia and the references but purely as a tv show its nowhere near one of the best
television,removed,omg one day you are so cool
television,removed,download an app called mercari and use the invite code kvtckj and get to spend on anything hurry while it last til aug this is legit pinky promise
television,removed,major networks be like
television,removed,downvoted for using the work nostalgia
television,removed,cant wait for season
television,removed,ok
television,removed,major networks does it have modern music and have at least a gay or lesbo in it pushing the envelope stranger things no its an throw back with innocent kids being the main focus you knowstuff everyone can enjoy major networks no thanks
television,removed,he missed one appeals to the lowest common denominator
television,removed,bringbackrevan
television,removed,im french so i always get the commercialfree version be it via netflix or the pirate bay
television,removed,race baiting oh man its so fun to watch people cry like little babies about reporting on news that involves minorities lawl go on find me a clip of trevor racebaiting ill wait
television,removed,aka you dont watch his show aka you have absolutely no fucking idea if hes race baiting but hey hes not white and someone else accused him of playing the race card so it must be true obviously thanks for helping my point
television,removed,telling people they dont understand just because they disagree has become a hallmark of reddit though so good on ya for fitting in i never said anyone didnt understand this isnt about disagreement this is about a single fucking person showing me a single fucking incident of race baiting which is bullshit and why you tried to insult me instead of just finding a single clip
television,removed,if americans want to be constantly scolded about how racist they are by a foreign born agitator they can just watch their president
television,removed,yeah youd think when someone makes absurd claim of constant race baiting that they could find a single instance to back it up
television,removed,from your own fucking link i dont think noahs racist
television,removed,are you actually reading any of the shit links youre sending literally none of them show race baiting theyre barely even relevant to this thread
television,removed,thats not race baiting holy shit you people are fucking stupid
television,removed,none of those are even barely relevant show me a fucking clip of him race baiting also lol at the notion of someone race baiting without being racist how fucking stupid are you
television,removed,heres an article about bill oreilly race baiting oh no wait thats literally just the first article i could find that says bill oreilly in it so basically about as relevant as the biography and jewish defense links that you posted great job dude you really showed me
television,removed,i dont even like tds with trevor i linked directly to the clip of him saying fuck white people but thats not racist amirite i simply asked for a single e
television,removed,oh yes some bratty kid talking at me for a minute fucking kill me already please also laughing my ass off fuck white people is not race baiting go buy a dictionary so i just watched and he says we should be able to be procop and problack and then this faceless voice bitches about it youve got to be joking me dude
television,removed,the shouldve hired an established american comic to host not an unheard of south african but if you pay peanuts
television,removed,yes but hes not the fucking host you fucking morons he was a correspondent and he never took over for stewart
television,removed,yeah but black slaves picked some cotton so they like totally built this country maaaaaan
television,removed,
television,removed,because thats literally the worst thing white people suffer
television,removed,maybe an american could be better at satirizing america
television,removed,theyre so butthurt and running scared they barely mock trump anymore its more angry grumbling at how wayciss he is
television,removed,i have seen almost every episode the tone of the show is definitely not the same he does have a different perspective on things than jon it is relatively similar in politics but the delivery is not the same basically it feels like he has no stake in the game on a positive note the correspondent work is still great i fucking love jordan klepper and roy wood jr
television,removed,when will people like afraidofleaves realize they cant make up new definitions for words that already exist
television,removed,yea we wouldnt even have plumbing yet if it werent for all that cotton the slaves picked right
television,removed,the slaves decendants would still be building straw and dung houses over in africa if not for you guys
television,removed,slavery contributed fuck all to white success you think people digging ditches and picking cotton built america besides most wealth was wiped out in the civil war here are a few examples of why whites are more successful httpsenwikipediaorgwikilistofbritishinnovationsanddiscoveries httpsenwikipediaorgwikilistofenglishinventionsanddiscoveries httpsenwikipediaorgwikilistoffrenchinventionsanddiscoveries httpsenwikipediaorgwikilistofitalianinventions httpsenwikipediaorgwikilistofdutchinventionsanddiscoveries httpsenwikipediaorgwikilistofgermaninventionsanddiscoveries httpsenwikipediaorgwikiancientgreektechnology httpsenwikipediaorgwikilistofisraeliinventionsanddiscoveries httpsenwikipediaorgwikilistofcanadianinventions httpsenwikipediaorgwikitimelineofunitedstatesinventions httpsenwikipediaorgwikicategoryrussianinventions httpsenwikipediaorgwikilistofspanishinventionsanddiscoveries httpsenwikipediaorgwikilistofaustrianinventionsanddiscoveries httpsenwikipediaorgwikicategorybelgianinventions httpsenwikipediaorgwikitimelineofaustralianinventions
television,removed,white people are terrible tho
television,removed,give it time dude jon stewart wasnt always like that plus trevor is new to the country his still learning about american politics and all the shit i cant believe how you people cant see that youre comparing him to a born and raised american vs a guy who just moved here i think hes funny but you can tell he doesnt wanna talk to deeply about the subjects he might not know that much about as of yet and warm milk wtf does that even mean he grew up in south africa i bet money his ten times tougher then jon stewart in every way
television,removed,yeah but chris did a tour here the guy above you was talking about an american doing it in south áfrica not about south africa you and the people who upvoted you are full of shit
television,removed,you think jon stewart knew what he was talking about in his first year
television,removed,then its a good thing the tv show didnt go with that story because thats wildly implausible a billion times the energy of the most powerful thermonuclear bomb ever detonated put into rotational kinetic energy wouldnt even overcome ceres natural inward gravity let alone generate useful amounts of outward pseudogravity
television,removed,your an dumb idiot
television,removed,to me the biggest difference about oliver is that you can tell he really cares about the country its not just poking fun he really deeply cares
television,removed,this is what i was coming to say its like a fat comedian making fat jokes then being followed by a skinny guy making the same fat jokes now they arent funny anymore they make you want to punch the guy upside the head the daily show is at its heart about american politics and stewart was an american who felt pain when america was hurt even john oliver who isnt american married an american war veteran and has enough skin in the game to be able to praise or condemn americans
television,removed,wow you are very stupid pal im really curious of what you think is good if you think all those shoes are bad and overrated and have you even watched fargo its a new story each season dumbass
television,removed,hes a foreigner talking about american culture and politics without the standing to do so
television,removed,just upvote this shit so people can see how fucking stupid this became
television,removed,it was great way to repost idiot
television,removed,stop stalking people ms dymoke
television,removed,evan rachel wood is some mega piece of ass fyi she banged marylin manson for a few years before she banged the guy who played the thing in the recent shitty fantastic four movie and popped out a child
television,removed,what
television,removed,couchtunner streaming sites i havent used it since probably season of twd but they would upload new episodes shortly after they aired i never had a problem with it but just do a little search just in case it got sketchy
television,removed,we might lose them they are not ours they are of nature and we are fools to think we control nature

television,removed,feel free to remove yourself from continuing to be a pest
television,removed,identical to me i have blood from continents im quite confident there are few people on this planet with the same ancestry as me beyond my siblings that being said the wire is a masterpiece and no american should be able to deny that why would you think any of us give a shit what an asian thinks about the best tv show of all time what the fuck would you know thats like me trying to evaluate some cantonese movie about chinese culture what the fuck would i know idiot
television,removed,uhhh americans and brits love it too asians have some fucked beliefs about their own societies in east asia anyway you people are backwards as fuck and ridiculously naive
television,removed,unlikely it was mostly because people didnt like that i dont watch the show this is reddit after all you are allowed to have an opinion as long as its mine
television,removed,confirmed omg
television,removed,eat my dick
television,removed,this could be a mildly snappy remark if you go out of your way to misinterpret my comment and no even then that is not how a story is supposed to come together this season was filler
television,removed,it really isnt
television,removed,yes pleb
television,removed,oh no getting called out on watching television on rtelevision surely youve lost youre way over to raspergers dear friend
television,removed,im high on layers of irony so i cant even tell anymore probably little of both
television,removed,take the red pill it will make more sense
television,removed,retard alert retard alert
television,removed,
television,removed,wow so youre an absolute moron probably from somewhere rural too its a shame that concepts like historical context are too tough to grasp for your widdle white brain
television,removed,thank you for enlightening me on how mexican i am
television,removed,haha never mind im not mad anymore i just realized that being as dense and stupid as you is its own punishment have a good day buddy
television,removed,is it good
television,removed,im in your boat some of the writing had me pulling my hair at times one scene that stands out in my memory right now after the alley way scuffle between jonathan and steve the cop reacts in a totally inhuman way especially with it being a small town in claiming and maintaining his charge of assault against jon who bumped the cop on the nose while he attempted to break up the fight hes adamant about the charge unyeilding that had me embarrassed for the character and the writers and then the secretary at the police station guessing the details of the situation tells nancy that boys do such things for love but in reality he hardly stood up for nancys honor at all and he certainly didnt come close to throwing punches until his honor was in question then he went wild and so nancy melts and im thinking you cant be that naive although maybe in the end subconsciously she realized this and chose steve instead i certainly couldnt care less that being said i quite enjoyed the first episodes the last had me in fits at times but were enjoyable at others and the finale was pretty entertaining sorry for so much writing i felt the need to say something
television,removed,i was with you before they even announced this second season same storyline but it could have very easily been an anthology series with the happy ending or is it ending like so many movies had back then the cop goes to work for the feds the sister hooks up with the big haired douchebag the kid looks fine and happy to be rescued then you find out that all is not what it seems and the kid is actually a slug factory leaving all the kids who watched the show forever traumatized about petal faced monsters who hatched and now roam the sewers looking to abduct children into the upside down world it could have easily went that way but im so glad it didnt
television,removed,so did eleven die and why was the sheriff putting egos in that box in the middle of the woods
television,removed,i think you just didnt understand the ufo theres a reason the last couple episodes focused so heavily on the fact that this was all a story a story being told by people wrapped up in the big ufo hysteria of the time i could go more in depth but its been a while it is easily explained the ufo isnt real you are seeing the tall tale come to life the sheriff told that story the sheriff thought he saw a ufo so the viewer you are seeing his imagination of what happened all the ufo sightings in season are just the sheriff trying to make sense of it all and his belief in ufos winds up being our perspective through the whole season
television,removed,good riddance to a really shitty darkie
television,removed,barbwiresmatter
television,removed,and i bet her ass doesnt stink too bad either
television,removed,who gives a shit no one just you people who are karma police i dont give a flying cooters but plug who posts stuff just shut up shut it shut your face

television,removed,i wish i can remember what podcast i heard this from i think its talib kweli on the drink champs he said that someone had to be in the trunk to pause and play the music from an mpc or something similar
television,removed,it is ridiculous for him to say was the worst was by far and even plodded along for a while before gloriously redeeming itself
television,removed,i think its really good it has some hilarious moments as the family is now rich as fuck with his million dollar baseball contract they come from poor as shit ppl and them adjusting to interacting with high society is some down right lol shit there is a scene where they invite all these billionares over for a charity ball and they serve fried chicken from shop as they dont know what canapes are hahah but then it can pivot wildy to be a dramatic episode season was a bit meh but the season is way better

television,removed,over billion asians
television,removed,i mean that i would have guessed that italianamericans population would represent about times larger than the asianamerican population italy is a tiny peninsula of a few million people asia is the biggest physically and geographically continent in the world with nearly billion people the fact that there are as many asian americans as italian americans show how much racial discrimination especially in immigration asians have faced in this country for most of the century there were laws that barred immigrants from coming to the us
television,removed,so you think its fine to believe that black people as a whole have less manners than white people as a whole isnt that a gross oversimplification that borders on the insulting
television,removed,to have more asians in hollywood there has to be the case in a lot of places

television,removed,i bet you think these arent problems with science as it is practiced today httpsenmwikipediaorgwikireplicationcrisis httpretractionwatchcom this whole shut up its science is going to backfire badly scientific establishment is just a clique that supported corrupt hillary too ideals like scientific method or peer review is solid if they were practiced but like all ideals they are only used to silence opponents instead of improving the world through their practice
television,removed,i think very vindicated but then again shes as much of a smug piece of shit as any of those people who laughed at her on that panel and in the audience but like most of those people ann coulter is a political entertainer and in that she is successful but id remind you that though she was right about trumps chances of winning she bet in the primaries and in the general she still holds very adverse opinions in the book she wrote to ride the trump band wagon as soon as possible she even leaves subtle complaints in the preface about how the book was written in a hurry titled in trump we trust e pluribus awesome she lists some of the things she supports or is signalling to fight for in fact the very first paragraph in the very first chapter trump the great orange hope if writing a book about trump keep in mind to use the name trump as often as possible because president trump is a typomaniac a person who is obsessed with seeing his own name in print she says that during this summer every conservative felt that theyre losing an unfair fight alone against a permanent situation of democratic values listing abortion gay marriage transgender bathrooms immigration trade press for english drug legalization criminal law the iraq war and on and on these are the things people like and dislike her for sometimes literally on facebook shes a political entertainer shes a person who capitalizes by writing books and appearing on television to promote those books a common media tactic shared by the likes of donald trump and bill oreilly but also seemingly every public servant who appears on colbert or the daily show and succeeds by pushing political issues like so many emotional buttons

television,removed,this sketch just shows that these ivorytower east coast liberals didnt learn a thing from this election dismissing trumps victory as a racistfueled movement is exactly why they didnt see it coming in the first place if liberals had only attempted to have a sane discussion about immigration policy instead of unfairly characterizing trump as a racist hillary would have won instead the media and le epic liberal celebrities just turned their noses up at trump and his voters dismissing their plight as nothing but a bunch of bigotry and hatemongering they built a strawman and then pretended it was the real candidate

television,removed,yes thank you
television,removed,yeah samantha bee youre sexist we get it
television,removed,but john oliver is a white cisgendered heterosexual male that demographic is nonexistent to network executives unless of course youre a trump supporter but seriously i really do think his appointment was a shallow bandwagoning of the social justice movement that has been going on on the left not that trevor isnt a talented standup i just think the superficial appeal of replacing the aging white guy with a cool young black guy and not just any young black guy mind you but one with an accent was too much for them to pass up same reason larry wilmore got the colbert slot but then again im just a cisgendered white guy in my im probably just being racistso yea nvm the new daily show is awesome and larry wilmore is a comedic genius who doesnt have an annoying delivery at all

television,removed,nah this is a flagship show on the bbc thats run for decades in various formats clarkson et al will be dead before the grand tour achieves that the grand tour is unlikely to get the uk audience that top gear gets simply because its subscription based worldwide they may do similar pay no attention to internet experts who have only seen on incarnation of top gear and think thats what the show is about thats a popular era for the show but by no means the only one past and future

television,removed,if one side backs up their viewpoint and claims with citations and the other can only post their feelings and has no proof then yes one view is correct and the other is not you are what a dumb person trying desperately to sound smart looks like
television,removed,no i mean an opinion that is so easy to prove wrong i did it in a second search of google keep defending idiots that have arguments based on feelings not facts while you still try and take the superior high ground so sad and predictable how the most uneducated conservatives are the most loud and proud
television,removed,moving the goal posts to all journalists when there is a single comedy show host we are talking about good job dishonest moron wasting my time
television,removed,do you get enjoyment out of being an idiot then making up arguments when called out on it the topic has always been the claim that jon stewart is biased in his interviews now put up or shut up
television,removed,seriously fuck mr robot the more i think about digging into season the less i want to hah its elicited a strong mental reaction with me somehow after seeing the first two eps of
television,removed,gotham and arrow exchanged places over the season arrow started off on top then by midseason of season dipped slightly behind flash then shield then by the second half of season just went so bad gotham seemed better by comparison but then season of gotham arrived and actually earned its spot by actually getting a lot better
television,removed,i wasnt sure about the season as whole but those last two episodes convinced me fantastic comeback from a subpar compared only to itself not the rest of tv season
television,removed,yea nobody cares they probably cant read anyway
television,removed,such enrichment
television,removed,i just saw the series weeks ago according to this only malarkey is left from the people they interviewed this makes me sad
television,removed,yeah youre right we should elect a black guy as president or something so they know how sorry we are that will do it im sure of it
television,removed,ive read some germans thought he was a doctor coming to assist their side or tried to retreat but was confused in reality he dropped his weapon before sprinting over so he did not look like an immediate threat

television,removed,being a good guy in business is more about being honest about pricing and what you can do and coming up with a fair compromise when you fail to deliver on a promise
television,removed,i somewhat agree there havent been many amazing netflix shows but on average they seem better than the average shows elsewhere the handful of amazing shows you listed are the pulled from of shows on all networks netflix has really only tried liked tens of shows and most are watchable thats a really good rate and its really only a matter of time before they make one of those shows
television,removed,sure but smiling when youre cracking jokes isnt childlike thats sorta normal the comics version of negan was interesting and fun because he felt like a big kid he even trusted carl and was genuinely confused when people he hurt turned on him he wanted people to like him childlike the tv version at least what weve seen doesnt have that or that deranged happiness i mentioned he has a beard though and its weird because everyone agrees the show needs something new and it had that chance with this perplexing character who could happily do these awful things and wanted people to like him but instead they turned him into a bully with backup and a bat its frustrating because unless they change the character hes just going to be an extension of what the shows turned into as a whole uninteresting until someone dies
television,removed,girls i started watching it cause of nudity the show was more depressing to me and i couldnt stand the fat one

television,removed,i may have used the wrong term i guess what i mean is that i assume these shows are aimed at maybe the years old demographic whilst a show like gotbreaking bad etc would encompass a larger age range and so more likely to reach a critical mass as it were of course i may be way off with that assumption its purely anecdotal and based on my experience

television,removed,when it finished originally it was long stale and the electionspecial just showed the same gimmicks they finished on dave and i are absolutely thrilled about the opportunity to write what will grace jack and karen are thinking about in mutchnick said so basically trump sucks there are genders etc the new will grace is just going to be tumblr which is ironic when you think about why are the social justice warriors not screaming about the fact the lead character is played by a heterosexual male and the only gay cast member is a supporting actor and a token gay cliche the character of jack is just as bad as the mickey rooney asian neighbor from breakfast at tiffanys and wasnt joseph fienness michael jackson project totally shelved for him playing a race that he wasnt but making a straight guy the star of a sitcom playing an accessible gay character is ok its outdated like hiring dustin hoffman of today to play martin luther king jr the new will grace wants to have its cake and eat it too but in a world of cultural appropriation and social justice warriors its characters tropes and casting come across as either hackneyed inappropriate or just downright offensive im the gay guy in the group i like musicals and bottoming for randos because im obviously gay im an alcoholic funny lady who hangs out with the gay guy because i drink im a straight man playing a gay man very butch because it was more accessible to the public in the for the show to work the network said im also horrible at dating men so maybe i just might be straight wink im debra messing i dont date good i have a weird sexual chemistry with the will character that manipulates the audience into thinking we might end up together

television,removed,criminal minds season premiere the only reason i started watching and continue to watch this show is because of matthew gray gubler twelve seasons is too long and this show is definitely showing its age i really hope this is the last season it wont be however i am looking forward to the mggdirected elliotts pond episode and the return of the lovely and wonderful paget brewster the mindy project season premiere more people should watch this show i never see it discussed on reddit or any other forum for that matter sharp witty and charming it really is an underrated gem i hope they stick with the plotline of s mindy not dating and just learning to be alone that was introduced in the premiere subvert those romcom tropes mindy luke cage i have mixed feeling about this one i enjoyed it well enough but its probably my least favorite of the marvelnetflix productions the first half is much better than the second half and a lot of the dialogue is pretty clunky and corny however i love the blaxploitation elements and the music score and is perfect the characters were all pretty good with a couple of exceptions but luke himself isnt as interesting as some of the other marvel heroes

television,removed,ubarthaneous is a frequent rconspiracy poster who believes in pizzagate take anything he says with a grain of salt
television,removed,title was ones that we dont know about
television,removed,watch the episode if you have further questions its turkey in a can season episode
television,removed,only if you are incapable of looking past an inflammatory premise
television,removed,its not about creating safe spaces you cunt im just saying that if all you can do is call names thats not an argument
television,removed,yes the fact that this is all lost on you only speaks to your own ignorance i know having a mental impairment may affect your perspective but it doesnt actually change reality for the rest of us you understand that dont you
television,removed,you dont know me one second i believe this election is a joke third if you dont believe that then you are the uninformed idiot fourth i make well over figures fifth lay down so i can lay my balls on your head peyton manning style
television,removed,is this about how donald trump feels at the debate right now
television,removed,plan to watch this just to see how thomas haden churchs character fucks with her i do
television,removed,yeah sad thing is look where social justice warriors have us heading now theyre doing absolutely every fucking thing the government will later point out totally validated a military police state
television,removed,no youre actually wrong cruuushed
television,removed,fuck thanks for the cancer i had no idea this disgusting misanthropic proalcoholic imageobsessed garbage passes as light entertainment on morning us television i say that as a left wing pothead btw
television,removed,this is funny theyre acting like this is news to them no dont they were sure of his vulgarities forever now its public and they suspend
television,removed,the today show used to be pretty good i used to keep it on tv all morning as background but now its like a three hour buzzfeed video
television,removed,his bosses heard the whole thing in the control room while it was being recorded live
television,removed,i wanna rape you
television,removed,if you get a new boss do you go over every project youve done dating to at least and let them know of possible issues that might crop up
television,removed,honestly it would be tough for any candidate at that time to have zero dumbshit that they have posted or been recoreded doing i say if they were young they have an excuse if they are old and still doing dumbshit then they should be scrutinized for it
television,removed,is this really a story from last month about the bush emails wow well thats one good reason to elect felon clinton so we wont hear its all trumps fault for a few decades of course people like you will just scream its all bushs fault instead so i guess thats not much of a win
television,removed,shill
television,removed,blam collateral damage
television,removed,ask him for the reasons probably extra ratings or shock value theyve been asking trump or more that years if hes running for president he first ran for president in the year that snake is bushes nephewhe left the mic on and didnt tell him thats a set up why as black mail leverage so if he does win bush and the republican party can control him there is probably heavy dirt on obama too and for sure hillary and every other politician out there that can potentially be president its a leash used to by some as power to control them i dont think you can even get nominated by those parties unless the leadership can fully control your actions on certain issues the men behind the scenes now if the worst they can find on trump is that he wants to screw a beautiful woman and grab her pussy well who wouldnt
television,removed,also the fact that a common defense of the video is that trump was just talking about about hitting on a woman is the problem if you make that argument you are either a product or proponent of rape culture
television,removed,how did you watch the oc is it streaming anywhere
television,removed,no i am not defending trump at all as i said i do not want him to be president but i do aggressively defend logic and reason i feel that the modern left has completely lost touch with reality they no longer have a factbased thought process they think emotionally not logically i also see a ton of intellectual dishonesty coming from the left i liked democrats such as john kerry or even al gore even bill clintons political stances were reasonable i just think the man himself was a scumbag but i think the modern left has lost its mind
television,removed,yeah anyone who thought that the doctor would die after his final incarnation was just a fool its like making a pokemon anime where ash finally catches all the pokemon thats not gonna end a billion dollar franchise
television,removed,goddamn fat and insecure kids dictating how they want to be portrayed and dealt with through a character they can relate fuck them and fuck the producers for even acknowledging them
television,removed,she is horrible and elitist and she doesnt give a fuck but that is now our best case scenario the people in power constructed this scenario there is literally no legitimate reason why we should not be able to put someone like bernie sanders up there especially not now that we know the entire primary was a farce
television,removed,barb was kind of a loser and worse probably a lesbian its no wonder the whole town just kind of didnt care about her going missing in the face of legitimate horrors like people snatching up poor innocent white boys no time to be chasing around some stone cold butch named gina whos snatching up the riffraff

television,removed,the bushwhacker done trump in for million jeb might leave his room now
television,removed,i feel like the sluggish pacing theyre going for is fairly deliberate i dont think its a an issue of whether or not it found its footing its just that the show and what theyre doing with it is very different from other shows
television,removed,yt version is much better
television,removed,how you gonna be usin the invisibility cloak when i can see you taggin the damn wall omg this is better than harry potter﻿
television,removed,yup same here thats why im saying yt version is better then web version
television,removed,this show sucks watch the first two episodes then look up the ending online nothing happens
television,removed,geoblocked outside amazon video countries
television,removed,posted this a few weeks ago here it is again with minor modifications an incomplete list of the tv shows that i have watched and would recommend to anyone who likes the respective subject matter feel free to recommend any shows that would be a good addition
television,removed,do you have autism
television,removed,and heres some reasons not to every person i know who started watching this show dropped it most people i know who dropped it dropped it because there was too much drama and not enough explanations as to why there was this drama lost prometheus and the leftovers are the things i think of when i think of a storyline that had no real development and throws in random shit to make you say woah wtf was that all about only to realize that the writer never had a plan to explain a single damn thing because they arent creative enough to develop a solid storyline only creative enough to come up with crazy dramatic scenarios so i wasnt surprised at all though i found it very humorous when i learned that damon lindelof is responsible for all of these hes a hack and has already admitted that the leftovers will answer basically no questions and that its all about the journey while for an intelligent viewer the journey is having questions raised and answered if youre looking for senseless drama with loose scififantasy themes brought in entirely unprovoked without reason or explanation this show is perfect for you spoilers case in point you cant drink the water at that hotel in psuedopurgatory what was the point of the hotel whats wrong with the water why is everyone acting different at the hotel why is it a hotel of all places why does the clothes you wear determine your occupation in that hotel how did his dad know he was there what was the significance to anything that happened in the hotel if youre like me youve accepted that there is no answer and you also thought the entire hotel thing was a bunch of pointless bullshit made for you to think the show is deep despite that the creators couldnt even tell you why the fuck put this in no its not deep no deeper than the black goo in prometheus creating different monsters and eventually a xenomorph the alien from the alien franchise
television,removed,youre a special kind of person arent you hopefully you go back and realize your mistake
television,removed,the guy with balls is roger craig who holds the highest singlegame total for jeopardy at the previous record was held by ken jennings if you arent familiar with the jeopardy community there are some people who take the show really seriously it is similar to the folks who try to get on other game shows but jeopardy has a certain purity because it tests the individuals knowledge and has little random chance built into the game unlike wheel or price in fact word is that once trebek retires the jeopardy contestant list will be refreshed and players who have been on an episode before will be able to apply again i tell you all this to show what jeopardy is beyond a quiz show this website j archive has every single j game ever played with analysis of contestants chances a wager calculator and even last nights show usually up by noon well in this video roger craig him with the big balls explains how he used to the raw data from j archive that is simply the raw data from every game of jeopardy ever played to study for his appearance he created his own program or code im not sure which took the parsed data and categorized it so craig had all the questions jeopardy had ever asked about george washington – and the way in which they were asked – in one tidy bundle craig is also the first contestant to make use of the hunt and peck strategy of going to different categories and different values randomly he of course was very successful that way and it has since caught on with aggressive contestants one last thing in the usa i have noticed recently that bar trivia pub quiz whatever you call it has really caught on in popularity recently if you like trivia i know you can find a weekly game in your town or nearby usually in sports bars because they have alcohol and dont mind you sitting there a couple of hours it is much more enjoyable than high school brain bowl and i encourage anyone interested in going to a couple lots of fun cheers
television,removed,agreed its super annoying to watch hunt and peck happens because of the distribution of dd placements are such that the most common spot for a dd is so if you were trying to get the dd youd pick all the first i wish they would go to purely random dd placement no more hunt and peck strategy which is fucking terrible to watch
television,removed,its generally optimal strategy to go balls out before fj and get a runaway
television,removed,there is definitely considerable luck in jeopardy from who lands on the dd getting a dd right even knowing the fj or not i think somewhere around of fjs are answered correct getting a question you know is lucky in itself sure the human encyclopedias will get more right but even ken jennings only got of fjs right
television,removed,it could potentially be a worthwhile gamble though winning at any cost is more important in regular jeopardy because of the potential to win more the following days get on tournament of champions etc kids jeopardy is a one off event lets say you thought you were likely to get fj right optimal betting suggests to bet and lock up at least however when looked at from the standpoint of vs then it becomes a rational wager
television,removed,since is the most likely they pick all the first meaning they jump from category to category trying to find the dd its hard to follow what category they are currently in this is especially annoying when you dont realize the category has a specific clue in it required to get it correct as in my examples capitals vs capitals
television,removed,since is the most likely they pick all the first meaning they jump from category to category trying to find the dd its hard to follow what category they are currently in when they switch every question this is especially annoying when you dont realize the category has a specific clue in it required to get it correct as in my examples capitals vs capitals im sure its not hard to watch for plenty of fans however adjaceesque and i both used to enjoy casually watching the show and its less fun now because we have a harder time following whats happening there are other categories where the knowledge sort of builds off itself like the is a layup to make sure you know the trick of the category when they jump straight to the you dont really understand the trick yet further they generally go from easiest to hardest as the values get higher there is some benefit to knowing the relative trickiness of the correct response compared to other correct responses in the category you can no longer easily gauge that im just giving my personal experience that its harder to watch and enjoy since huntpeck became widespread you need to pay much closer attention now which isnt as fun for me enough so that i rarely tune in when i used to daily
television,removed,this was day of a day tournament of champions series day results day final scores roger tom buddy day final scores roger tom buddy cumulative scores roger tom buddy source
television,removed,the winner does get to go home with what the actual amount gets and gets
television,removed,to nitpick the math he actually needs about a chance of getting it right to make it a rational wager assuming hes trying to maximize his expected winnings for simplicity assume he wins if he gets a wager wrong im comparing the optimal wager that locks up a win of vs the actual wager he made of math
television,removed,youre an awful human being wow
television,removed,eat a bag of shit sir
television,removed,also thank mr skeltal for good bones and calcium
television,removed,admit it no one would miss you if you died
television,removed,heres the best research paper pdf i could find that helps explain dd wagering see section from basically the idea is betting huge and getting it right of the time might be give you like a shot at winning because of the relatively high likelihood of ending with a lock game betting small will keep you alive but have no shot at a lock game not having a lock game will give you like a shot at winning these numbers are simplified because it depends on the exact scores and clues left when deciding the dd but thats the basic idea
television,removed,posted by aelinsaar since he deleted his comment have you ever considered selfharm i think it would be a good look on you next time youre thinking about it stop thinking and just do it
television,removed,maybe he shouldnt have killed his wife then
television,removed,probably got aids from the big black buck she was cucking patton with
television,removed,the land of internet edginess
television,removed,fucking god it seems this little person never gonna stop milking his wifes death

television,removed,i could be your neighbor or your coworker shit we could be friends
television,removed,he should have thought of his career before he murdered his wife
television,removed,i closed the tab as soon as it ended now after reading your comment i had to reopen that tab and go check out their other videos fuck you guy
television,removed,so brave what courage it must take to continue life being a multimillionaire celebrity living in beverly hills who enjoys all the best things in life not like average working class folk lose mothers wives children etc every fucking day sick of hearing about this fat bitchs wife
television,removed,you have a very inaccurate and incomplete view on the situation in my opinion please be careful jumping to offensive conclusions so easily
television,removed,patton oswald is a cunt
television,removed,

television,removed,the funny thing is that people like you bash congress for trying to stop obama but the next time a republican candidate tries to enact an executive order youll be on my side good point thx
television,removed,do the world a favor never post another comment on the internet for as long as you live you have nothing worthwhile to say thank you have a nice day

television,removed,you are a total fucking piece of shit
television,removed,bro are you mad
television,removed,i have exactly the same experience in my late i went through a depression and gilmore girls was the one thing that would make me feel happy and hopeful i mustve watched the series half a dozen times although i always stopped at the scene where lukes kid shows up since after that the show somehow got depressing to me
television,removed,lol wow do people actually believe the horseshit that you shared if you are searching for coordinated corruption maybe you should check under your own partys nose
television,removed,so pirate it gotcha
television,removed,rpiracy
television,removed,good he was a callous and condescending cunt to everyone who disagreed with him he was particularly vile and venomous to anything and anyone that didnt swallow the sjw propaganda pill theres a difference between outlandish and offensive humor and directly insulting individuals im all for the idea that comedy should have no bounds which patton isnt even in agreement with but often not his comedy would turn into preaching if hes never at his again i will be happy maybe he wont be as obnoxious its too bad it took a dead wife to humble him
television,removed,httpvaughnlivetvcastlehawkthorne
television,removed,shills like you wish it werent
television,removed,you are an idiot and youre a delusional manchild who has no ability to take responsibility for his own moronic actions now can you take your bullshit back to rpolitics
television,removed,i stopped midread highlighted this sentence and was about to post the exact same comment the only thing and i mean the only thing ive seen on social media from people who support trump is that hillary did something with her emails although id bet if pressed to explain of those people would have no idea what that thing was its such a ridiculous attempt at politicizing a nonissue which is exactly what they tried to do with benghazi
television,removed,fuck off op this is a clinton subreddit
television,removed,no my point is that the grown up choice is hillary a vote for anyone other than hillary is a vote for trump he desperately needs a big party vote to have a shot here if youre voting party youre voting for trump both sides are not equal here you want to fix the system great me too try in years bernie made a huge crack in that wall and maybe we can break it next time but this year is too critical to risk throwing your vote away over
television,removed,there is no such thing as an unbiased person unless theyre an idiot and most trump supporters are idiots
television,removed,yeah because hillary is so popular lol shill
television,removed,tell me that again once assange is done shill
television,removed,ah so youre one of those never trump cowards who lets fear control you fair enough
television,removed,denial is the first step you fucking shill i hope you know youre going to be the first ones lynched when these crooks are brought to justice and all of their little pawns are outed
television,removed,nah its cause jo is a liberal cuck

television,removed,on mobile so i cant tag so spoilers the twist is just that el opened the gate and set off the entire chain of events its a predictable twist but its a twist
television,removed,
television,removed,youre not missing too much huge plot holes like the monster kills adults in seconds but a child survives for a week
television,removed,they wouldve been watching all the same movies from that period that influenced their aesthetic though i think its more growing up on the media of that period than directly living it for the duffers that said if they grew up somewhere more rural its likely things were still pretty much like this in the early nineties
television,removed,i thought it was okay lol
television,removed,no there are tons of shows that i like even love even though they are nothing like real life there are also shows that do an actually good job of being real and i love those as well but stranger things is actively trying to real then failing in every possible way or maybe im just over cliche unoriginal bullshit take your pick

television,removed,and a terribly underwhelming sandwich this made me laugh so thanks im hopeful for you because just imagine how many more amazing sandwiches are out there waiting to be discovered but you lucked out finding one of the best tv shows of the last decade not a high bar i know so congrats on finding some fun in the world after all your hardship but try not to watch every episode in a a month if its enjoyable make it last i should probably add some quote from the show but others will do that better still consider that you have not even begun to peak good luck
television,removed,you seem like the one to ask where would you put the prank on dee as a standup comic that episode transcended tv for me it was art but too painful to watch again
television,removed,top best series in this list
television,removed,
television,removed,that must be why you didnt choose to address them no your points were just blatant hillary fanboyism why would anyone with an iq above that of a goat bother retort to that im not going down to those levels dont get too used to it it looks very much like people like me competent people are going to be back very very soon good i dont like trump as much as i didnt like hillary if you people ie the hillary fanboys find another candidate that isnt a corrupt degenerate ill gladly support you as i did with obama and any other candidate that has a shred of credibility and honesty you clearly make bad choices no the fact that hillary isnt president shows that people can still make good choices also when you reduce politics to voting for the lesser evil each election youre going to end up stooping lower and lower into the degenerate zone except you know he lost by million votes yes you are still deluded the dnc colluded against him states that favored him went decreased their voting booth counts by so none of his supporters even had the chance to vote you get a fluke win and youre already planning to stay longterm only planning a long term stay because folks like you are still on their high horses shoving your pc opinions down the throats of everyone you also seem to value identity politics more than being pragmatic or even logical you live in a echo chamber of expert opinion from cnn

television,removed,what like graces death funeral and burial the events of which are discussed every episode but not shown
television,removed,for a few minutes to help out with some strange technology she played the nerd on the show as she was sherlock and arrow was watson with arrows character type once the island arc finshed and then slade you suddernly had mins of tv show to fill so you have situations where john barrowman should of been killed off and then suddenly reappear back from dead once writer wanted to explain thea queen backstory which just goes on tangent of episodes that irrelevant to the main character plotstoryadventure
television,removed,your type there are several flavors of course but im too unmoved by anything about you to look at your comment history to find out which has some of the most hilarious levels of selfimportance on the planet i refuse to think its unironic but if youre serious about how highly you think of yourself i feel for you and everyone you know to help advance the conversation i asked respectfully if youd repeat the question you think im dodging i seriously dont know what it is you didnt i asked you if there was a word or concept thats been disallowed by political correctness thats impeding your selfdetermination and you refused to answer and instead linked to some angry college kids which seem to scare you quite a lot thats not what i asked for i asked for a term or concept that you think should be allowed because without it it impedes your self determination thats actually at the very core of political correctness informing which words or concepts are offensive to people so id like to see the casualties of your war and gauge if they are actual serious threats to democracy we need examples kid its clear to any serious person what happened here if you refuse to complete those simple tasks for an old videogameplayin grandad like me

television,removed,brit marking can do no wrong it was her idea her as the main protagonist and her craptastic acting it was slow comments have regarded it as the new stranger things no way not even closei hate when shit is ambiguous as all hell the ending was like vanilla sky which inception was also like cerebral movies are fine and tv shows but this being about angels and ambiguous spirit guides with pseudomaori haka dance i am knit picking cause a lot of it could have been done in a goddamn hour and the whole saving themfrom where from the basement of that batshit crazy dr that got away with everything wheres he at and if its a celestial portal to a different dimensionreality and she did it for love then the forked reality she would jump to wouldnt be the same goddamn homer it was like a big fucking circle jerk of a show and i feel like i wasted time trying to figure it out and homerreally fucking geebus is that a homage to the iliad and the odyssey cause he wasnt some epic herohe wasnt even an antihero he was like the dumbass homer from the simpsons fuck this show
television,removed,big black cock
television,removed,wow a website literally run by george soros open society foundations you libfags complain about bias but seem unable to recognize it yourself the difference between these farm murders and murders in general are they are having their homes invaded and being raped tortured murdered and then robbed and a government that seems to more or less support it theyre clearly racially motivated yet you dont have anyone like obama or trevor noah even willing to discuss them
television,removed,i should make some more reddit accounts to downvote you even more stop making everything about race
television,removed,well and one pretty fantastical alien device thats pretty important for the main story i wouldnt really call it hardsci fi its a space adventure a la cowboy bebop with believable scifi and politics but the focus is very much on the crew of the ship and the story not so much the actual science greg egans diaspora or something is what id classify as hard scifi and stuff like this is pretty much impossible to put on a tv screen
television,removed,lmfao hold up your my little pony stuffed toys msirs this lad is the big fann of terry quinn he has you to need to know this and how much he loves mister quin the bmovie star
television,removed,this show is why clinton lost the election
television,removed,idk man that laughing is bad and it seems like the guests often have to carry the interview you can even see some of them cringe when he starts laughing and pounding on the desk watch some of the compilations on youtube
television,removed,those magical state governments the same ones that once refused to integrate schools the same govts who are regulating the bathroom people can use so once the federal govt is neutered we can live the in the paradise of libertaria where corporations own everything but hey at least you made the choice to be a fucking slave go back to league you idiot
television,removed,he made clinton his sofs possibly sending her to the white house anything good hes done might be overshadowed by whatever fresh hell she puts the country through
television,removed,the nose knows
television,removed,targeting us citizens for assassination blowing up hospitals with predator missiles invading syria without a declaration of war
television,removed,everything indicates it you dont have to look long to see that the democratic party is fractured we have middle americans being petted against wealthy americans black americans rioting all over the place hispanic americans lgbt is protesting all over we have womens rights black rights gay rights we have democrats hating republicans and republicans hating republicans and democrats hating democrats we have liberals and conservatives everyone is pulling on the arms of government to fill the void with answers caused by the inaction and lack of leadership and conviction by obama we have a terror attack rather than unifying the country in grief and do his best to prevent it in the future by unifying the people he makes a statement about guns we have a terror attack in san bernardino rather than unifying the country he educates the american people on islam as if we are all a bunch of bigots just waiting to lynch muslims again there is not one single incidents it is a series of incidents caused by a genuine lack of leadership causing a void that other groups think they can fill with their own answers causing division that is why you see a socialistic uprising where bernies people propose we have to tax the wealthy and break up wall street or a huge movement on trumps side where we have to decrease taxes and increase growth both are correct what does obama think he does not even talk to his own party he is not doing anything he tells people we have to increase the minimum wage federally to and does not budge one bit certain states would crumble in an increased min wage instead he doubles down and achieves nothing trump meanwhile wants to leave the min wage issue to the states and voila all people are happy some states will increase it snd some will leave it be either way it will work better than force everyone to pay more killing jobs and benefit the conglomerates i could go on and on but my point is just that he genuinely hasnt lead and its whats brought us to where we are in terms of division as for a hostile congress a hostile congress doesnt magically appear out of nowhere its hostile because republicans have had nothing to gain from this president and so they see it more beneficial to do nothing than let him force his entire agenda down the country again keep in mind that it is people who elect congress obama lost both the house and the senate to the party that ran on repealing obamacare again the hostile congress didnt come from nowhere

television,removed,freudians an idiot obviously youre not making up bills history of supporting deregulation particularly with glass steagall it doesnt matter if he hasnt heard complaints until the last six months he shouldve been hearing them since the crisis he also seems to think speculating that your a sanders supporter somehow nullifies your critiques of bill what a jackass
television,removed,could you please say your name and address it would make it so much easier for something aweful to happen to you but nothing you wont ask for yourself who knows maybe you will be skinned and burned until you beg for suicide internet is a scary place

television,removed,our society really needs to stop being so manchildesque an adult western males life in is far too consumed with anime cartoon and popular culture as opposed to things it should be consumed with our nation stands right now on the brink of a race war people need to begin educating themselves to understand how years of failed democratic policies and ideas have caused this situation they need learn history and learn that the fake narrative of undue oppression of blacks by whites is simply not real they need to understand how democrats progressives and leftwing ideologues divide people up by race gender and sexuality with empty buzzwords like privilege and oppression the end result more clicks for them and a disunified society for us which spends most of its time on infighting rather than making real change or real progress of any sort seriously man put down the fucking comic book youre too old at this point get over it and get with the problem its no wonder its always the dorky comic book nerds that are the biggest socialists and sjws theyre the ones that spend the most of their time immersed in a world of fiction and fantasy
television,removed,great show but i gotta admit even as much as i like the show season was pretty weak it had the most episodic vs arc story telling compared the the past seasons and the arc didnt even resolve itself the show writers do love their cliffhangers

television,removed,they were raised to believe that indiscriminateness is a moral imperative that the only way to be moral is to not discriminate between right and wrong good and evil better and worse truth and lies because your act of discrimination – discriminating between these things might just be a reflection of your personal discrimination your bigotries they were raised to believe that indiscriminateness is a moral imperative because its opposite is the evil of having discriminated the second bullet point and this is an essential corollary is that indiscriminateness of thought does not lead to indiscriminateness of policy it leads the modern liberal to invariably side with evil over good wrong over right and the behaviors that lead to failure over those that lead to success why very simply if nothing is to be recognized as better or worse than anything else then success is de facto unjust there is no explanation for success if nothing is better than anything else and the greater the success the greater the injustice conversely and for the same reason failure is de facto proof of victimization and the greater the failure the greater the proof of the victim is or the greater the victimization

television,removed,it would be good for morale if at any time of the battle jon could rally his men with him and do something commanderish as far as i could tell he was lost then crushed if he could get just people moving with him men nearby would move too and join in his push perhaps if he could cripple a part of the shield wall and break through that would be what jon is there for it was always planned that jon would fight but it was also always planned that they would hold use the trenches and spikes to hold off a flank and try to stall the larger force and create their own meat grinder on their terms as opposed to getting crushed and relying on a deus ex machina we knew the vale knights were coming everyone else apart from sansa didnt

television,removed,literally there is no such thing as biological race hahahahahaha thats not a debate science has anymore then why are there so many studies on fucking race tell the guys at the charles darwin institute race is a real thing but its a cultural and social issue not a bilogical one there has been far too much gene flow and gene drift for humanity to have race designations which explains why worldwide black iqs happen to be lower than asian and white iqs worldwideits all just one big social construct if only they had more money their iqs would increase yes yes

television,removed,well as to your somalia pint thats why we already have years and years of vetting before allowing people in its actually a very difficult process with a lot of stringent requirements the idea that we all of a sudden put a holdkn people who have passed years of work to get to this point only toto be stopped at the door to america thats a problem this sort of ban needed to be phased in further upstream thatah be the goal but they shouldnt have all of a sudden put a blanket ban out of nowhere when peoples entire liveswere focused day in day out on proving themselves and becoming americanthen bam door in their face we should have just announced it was going to be revised and implemented thos revisions further upstream at every stage of the process but the wouldnt haveade such a show of it so we used an executive order to dictate something that needs eventual congressional oversight and approval

television,removed,you sound rational and informed what is your breitbart comment section user name
television,removed,this show is taking a long time to get to its point and im starting to worry the multiple concurrent storylines might get lost in the fray i liked the first two episodes but this one felt like more of the same in a less than flattering way
television,removed,another good episode i have a feeling that arnold committed suicide by trying to transfer his consciousness to the robots ford helped arnold in this endeavor and saved his consciousness to then be uploaded with the recent update i dont really know how they are going to handle a host killing a customer though the whole park is predicated on safety and the rich are not going to pay all that money if there is even the slightest chance of being killed
television,removed,the randomness was acceptable to me personally because it was such a surprise but still a rather believable situation he had pushed too hard then hit a raw nerve and she snapped she regretted it to a large degree because she loved him but she couldnt stop the rage because shes too much like him and he foolishly provoked her too much shades was already convinced that cottonmouth was too foolish to fix the problems of luke the missing weapons and was upset that he kept making high profile fuck ups he already thought that mariah was the smarterwiser of the two so seeing that for whatever reason she had already done what he thought had to be done he was impressed and decided to support her killing off a compelling character is an interesting choice and one that game of thrones as an example has abused shamelessly mariah taking his place provided an interesting shift in her own characters development and highlighted the fact that both poor choices and bad luck can change everything diamond back is ok to me because he is a mystery from the beginning who is he and then why is he so crazy even as they reveal a bit more about him it still leaves him as a crazy mystery maybe there is no real reason for him to target luke the way he did except for the fact that hes unstable before cottonmouth died shades was relaying his threats we dont hear him directly but its credible shades says that diamondback has changed repeatedly when cottonmouth dies diamondback might only be changing his mind possibly similarly to how he may have turned on luke and only now saying he wanted to support cottonmouth no matter what he killed a room full of customers because they dared to buy from a more reliable vendor instead of killing his competitors and delivering the goods that had already been paid for he tries to kill shades even though shades has legitimately and faithfully been doing his best to repair and salvage every bad situation thats popped up hes never tried to cheat or undermine diamondback or challenge diamondbacks authority perhaps hed change his mind about luke if hed succeded in killing him as well

television,removed,fucking forest scene litereally
television,removed,enough with the rape as a special kind of evil trope on a scale of bad shit that can happen to a person its like maybe a rape is a form of battery on that usually leaves no lasting harm as approsed to other forms of violation like traumatic brain damage disfigurement paralysis having limbs blown off in war listen and believe rapes were also a tactic used by the kkk to harm black men they use them today for the same purpose look at the judge in canada who asked why she didnt keep her legs together in a legitimate line of questioning he would have been in deriliction of his sacred duty had he not asked and yet because he asked he was attacked smeared and a disbarment campaign was run against him if she was raped she can act like an adult file a police report and get a rape kit like an adult if she wants to spread life damaging innuendo like a teenager she fuck right off women are not children

television,removed,innocent till proven guilty is a legal concept and means nothing outside of the courtroom you idiot
television,removed,wasnt the whole point of the sexual revolution consequence free sex wasnt free love supposed to be exactly that hookups fuck whoever you want and now that everyones been led to believe sex isnt really all that important suddenly its all rape sounds like someone got bait and switched maybe marriage isnt so bad after all
television,removed,its almost as if she wasnt raped and instead made a false accusation for attention and sympathy
television,removed,or attention seeking you can never tell with the hollywood types
television,removed,you arent entitled to other peoples sympathy neither is rachel wood the world is a cruel place and frankly im fed up with the news gradually becoming a dispassionate list of people whove been raped
television,removed,women do like to tell the world when they have been sexually assaulted im starting to feel bad for the women who havent been raped and dont have a story to tell
television,removed,cashing out on victimization and feminism i see
television,removed,she is a woman on reddit there will always be someone to discredit their struggle since its a woman reddit is such a circle jerk against woman
television,removed,why would anybody rape her shes so ugly
television,removed,her character is dragged into a barn and the door is closed at first everyone assumes she is raped but as the show progresses you learn she was actually being searched for information i cant get into specifics without spoiling a tiny bit of the story
television,removed,please every show treats their audience like they are complete idiots take any drama show and compare politicians there to real life politicians overacting like a mother fucker house of cards some say it is intelligent show but actors are still treating audience like complete morons
television,removed,yeah bringing awareness to rape was so last year its no longer interesting to you so they should really just shut up about it and get over it right your username is very accurate

television,removed,supportive comments highly upvoted buried and banned trolls talking shit in deleted comments zomg le redpill brigade is killing my interwebs the liberal fear mongering and love of victimhood on full display
television,removed,its hard to find a situation where you think someone deserves to be raped but im pretty sure that snarky comments about how everyone elses comments are shitty makes the list
television,removed,the pizzagate thing is hilarious yeah kids disappearing and being rapedmurdered is so funny its disgusting people still just laugh it off without doing a second of research theres a reason its still being looked into

television,removed,they didnt pussy out and they took it one step further about time walking dead showed some unpredictability
television,removed,while i expected both glenn and abraham to die i did not expect them to show their deaths to the full extent that they did seeing two characters get their heads smashed in like that effected me viscerally more than any other show ever has nothing comes close not even anything on game of thrones
television,removed,im not lavernius dipshit now try spinning your bullshit against my argument
television,removed,breaking news
television,removed,its an odd article its pretty clear the author just doesnt like them making fun of clinton and thinks they should be making fun of trump more but since the shows most recent premiere jost and particularly che have been presenting clinton as an undesirable lesseroftwoevils option this election season trumps an idiot for sure but dont mascarade your article as an snl article if its really a dont making fun of the candidate i support article she even compares them to trump supporters this week che echoed a favorite talking point from trump campaign manager kellyanne conway about clintons favorability ratings then talks about how they dont attack trump enough che and jost by contrast didnt even say a single thing about the nasty woman punchline trump served up on a silver platter she also has in her article

television,removed,pseudoaddiction my sister has had back pain ever since a car accident years ago very little at first but building up year after year now she has to take a lot of strong painkillers to not be in pain and consequentially needs more and more because of tolerance she claims she would take them if she didnt have pain but she has to fight with doctors who dont want to prescribe them to her because they think she has an addiction problem she agrees that she has a problem but that it is the pain which is the problem not the opiods so heartbreaking right now and very little i can think of to do to help her
television,removed,netflix is on point it will take some serious mistakes moving forward for them to fail any time soon and given their track record thats unlikely its much needed too tv sucks netflix just needs to figure out a livestreaming module so they can start to get live coverage for events like comedy shows concerts festivals conventions sports etc the landscape isnt changing its already changed ive been watching of my content online for years now look at the wwe they were able to make their own network the wwe network online and have successfully cut out a middle man increasing their profits while making all content more affordable and easily accessible to consumers the only thing theyre lacking live content but i honestly think at this point thats because of contracts with the television networks that air their live shows
television,removed,so far so good from netflix just hope all the oc content doesnt get watered down

television,removed,same here i would much prefer they just stuck with old movies and tv shows there are so many terrible movies on the streaming netflix the one most people talk about and use and hardly any good ones anymore unlike the classic dvd based netflix really disappointing i cancelled my subscription
television,removed,i cant imagine reality tv shows doing that well on a streaming service theyre really cheap to put together which is why the tv media companies love them and theyre able to set up the demographics and spin the shows in just a way for people to watch it if it just happens to be on when they flip through the channels same for all of the other cheap to produce junk tv shows all over cable
television,removed,netflix is viewed as more independent even with their original content so media companies are more willing to work with them though at the moment theyre all trying to start their own netflixs if disney buys netflix itll be viewed as a disney streaming service and i highly doubt well see much from other media companies worse than it is now its only a win if you both love netflixs oc and disney

television,removed,he was also concerned that his show was doing harm that was one of the biggest reasons he quit when he was on oprah and she asked why he left he responded with a story about a racial joke he was doing being taken the wrong way by a couple of people on set he said he realized that even if he doesnt share their views he may be feeding into stereotypes held by racists and he had an issue with that
television,removed,sarcasm usually has an element of wit and intelligence so you can see why we were confused
television,removed,so youre admitting that your original post no but this one does was just stupid and needless and completely off base okay thanks

television,removed,i remember years ago that the movie with brad pitt and morgan freeman was very disturbing in its graphic depictions i did not enjoy it very much because of that its not something they showed on tv shows or something i would have ever expected them to but a few years later criminal minds aired and was showing the same type of violence i tried to get through a few episodes but was never able to watch that show of victims bound and tortured by sadists in creative ways has tv become more violent absolutely even some network shows are sick with violence and gore fortunately for our children female nipples remain censored s

television,removed,funny thing is that trump won among those earning more than those earning less than went for hillary to suggest trump supporters are hurting is only partially true trump was able to snag a section of those who earn less than those jobless in the rust belt state essentially trump kept the republican and snatched a section off of in the rust belt

television,removed,i dont think you can bring back chapelle show it would constantly be judged against and never live up to the original a combo of it being amazing more powerful at the time and the memberberries i also dont think he would want to bring it back if he even could its the whole rock star thing you make music that is popular you develop a sound if you try to switch it most of the people hate it because it isnt what they expected and as an option the alternative of just touring around as a senior citizen playing the songs that made you hot years ago is extremely depressing its like a we dont care what you want to play or do people dont want to hear new music from bon jovi they want to hear all the hits and then complain on how the vocalsinstrumentalsshows were so much better when they were in their i think he could do a new show but im not sure about sketch he was amazing with his monologue i emailed it to my dad a trump voter and even he liked it but the sketches just felt very weak familiar faces but none of what made them great to begin with i blame jj abrams id much rather see him behind the daily show desk than trevor noah but i dont think hed even want to do that much maybe a once weekly show more of the last week tonight model still bring in rotating bands do the occasional sketch maybe bring in other comics but chapelle show nah bruh its never coming back just like your pops who went out for a pack of smokes

television,removed,and a barely any recent trump voter will ever be convinced ive seen his skits have massive impact people mention his retirement skit constantly as im the retirement industry im a fiduciary so enjoy that im on the right side of it if he never ever ever ever makes any reach outs to anyone else im fairly certain he wouldnt have to change that much hes nothing more than a circlejerk

television,removed,world peace is a great show its trash just like you trump supporters
television,removed,i mean i drew parallels between trumps rise to power and hitlers rise to power after watching the debates and the electorate lap his logic defying promises up and blame insert group here for all the problems facing the poor white man people draw parallels between him and hitler because theyre both nationalist that rose to power on on a huge group of disgruntled and near impoverished workers i dont think hell start goosestepping down penn avenue and gassing the latinos but it it really hard not to draw parallelsi dont need cnn or any other source to tell me a narrative im smart enough to think for myself now if you want to correct me on why trumps unprecented rise to power does not mirror nationalist leaders throughout history then please be my guest
television,removed,usually a big issue here in spain for future reference change youtubecom to youpakcom and it will work the large majority of the time doesnt work on op cos it got taken down though i assume its some sort of proxy site i havent had any issues with it at all and very easy to remember plus better than using an extension something like hola which isnt safe

television,removed,oscar
television,removed,yessss
television,removed,the standup has funny moments i mean they show it at the beginning of her sketch show trainwreck sucked big time but if i recall it was both because it tried to really have some feminist overtones to it too much like a really really hot guy wanting to fucking amy and being a retard and then trying to shoehorn in some meaning at the end they do this in south park sometimes and its equally cringey to be honest no dont start playing piano keys and have stan say some dumb feel good bullshit
television,removed,is this a team of men thats wrong they must not like women we need to put some women in there now or theyre bad people in june adult swim had male showrunners and female ones is that a coincidence
television,removed,the only reason they all missed the trump phenomenon was due to liberal bias in reporting discounting the conservative narrative driving middle america to the polls
television,removed,yeah see this flying around a lot apparently its liberals fault that people voted for a bigot because their standards of acceptance are too high people seem to believe every thing and every piece of politics is a zerosum game you want safe spaces well fuck you no space is safe now you asked us to be too accepting and now we dont have to accept anyone its a fucking joke
television,removed,most people in the uk are whiny liberals
television,removed,legalize ranch
television,removed,a video made by some twat who happens to host a talk show is posted on your fb feed and that caused you to change your vote really vote for trump if that is what you believe in thats fine even though i disagree with him but i hope what felt wrong in the end was voting for a candidate because you were throwing a hissy fit about a fb post voting is a responsibility that people in this country need to take more seriously
television,removed,i like her and dont like seeing people call her a stupid feminist cunt all day

television,removed,la times called the popular vote at for trump which is was not it was for hillary although some votes postelection being called may not have been counted im a bit fuzzy on this either way the result was within polling error which isnt to say the polls didnt miss they did but the la times did not have some kind of secret sauce the rest were missing and it wasnt by a huge amount ny times idiocy aside more rigorous estimates see had trump at around chance of winning which again is still a miss but hardly inconceivable
television,removed,if you missed it you can watch it
television,removed,m radio isnt conspiracy nutjobs its heavy talk radio that is deeply conservative and alex jones who is one of the conspiracy nutjobs i was talking about fox isnt your voice on tv uh no nonreligious midwestern bluecollar people arent in any way represented by the same fox news that wont stop talking about the war on christianity and how we need to break the back of unions even harder in fact that whole union thing is why some of these states have been blue since reagan thank you for proving my point about how out of touch everyone is with the midwest hell half the reason the people here voted for him is because it would piss off the republicans as much as the democrats
television,removed,edited
television,removed,as someone that works with kids the way the sp kids are behaving is very similar to todays youth which makes this season especially funny member berries also resonate with me as its the exact mentality ive been utilizing during this election cycle to keep sane the dicks out thing is a bit much but the season isnt too bad not my favorite but not the worst
television,removed,that joke has been death for years
television,removed,fuck them i hope they get assassinated
television,removed,meanwhile the constant media narrative like this video that everything wrong with america is the fault of white people drove conservatives to the polls it also made people like me who are independents but lean very heavily democrat not give a shit people are complaining about the electoral college but they actually did their job this time all they have to go on is your opinion and if everyones opinion is meh i dont really give a shit you decide then this is what happens but the nail in the coffin was really the corruption of the democratic party when rigging the primaries against bernie then pulling the same shit that got everyone to hate republicans in telling everyone who was disenfranchised to toughen up and get in line and that they were acting ridiculous even though you totally just fucked them in an extremely immoral and unethical way

television,removed,canada is like the sane snowy version of america without all the violent blacks and hispanics
television,removed,this was about as funny as a wall without the laugh track it would be obvious that this is nothing else but yet another media hit job on trump continuing the sale of racist and sexist america and furthering the divide fuck you you unfunny partisan pieces of shit
television,removed,talent mostly goes to hollywood soon as it gets good dont dare mention you are trying to move to canada if youre american though they dont want you since obviously all americans voted for trump since he won the election apparently decided by unanimous consensus just ignore the fact far more canadians migrate to the us than vice versa and americans dont give them any shit for it or tell them to stay out
television,removed,kids in the hall
television,removed,yes thats what it means you fucking lunatic
television,removed,i hope youre right and most canadians have more sense than what it has looked like in the past day and half since the us election americans dont give canadians or people from any other country shit when they come to the us legally so try to keep some perspective when the reverse happens not use it as an opportunity to use them as a punching bag because you dont like the person of them elected and the ones interested in moving most likely didnt

television,removed,yeah man it really united the republican party which is why trump got less votes than both mitt romney and john mccain trump was an unlikely candidate that even the republican party thought had no shot of winning yet he still won the polls said he would lose by several points but in the end the kind of people who didnt want to say in polls that they would vote for him showed up and voted for him perhaps the kind of people who were tired of being constantly socially bullied
television,removed,there was more than in the first season but only once per season after they introduced that rule and correct me if im wrong but the rule was one uncensored fuck per season there are more occasions where it was said but censored if youre watching on netflixbluray theyre all uncensored so you can missforget that

television,removed,ok so what is your plan of action for this election do you think protesting or not voting for hillary and letting donal trump win will actually fix any of the things youre concerned about dont be stupid you have to vote for trumps opponent theres a long road of political and social agitation ahead to fix what youre concerned about and it can be done but allowing trump to become president now will just set back that process ya dummy

television,removed,k its not like of all good entertainment is made here or anything
television,removed,i dont think you really understood what i was saying i wasnt saying it was odd i said it was ironic given the current and past terrible relationship between police and the black community i dont think all black people somehow dont have health respect for the rule of law youre putting words in my mouth im saying that theres some irony in that fact given the state of the relationship between lots of black communities and the police that are supposed to serve them but dont but sure keep reading racism where there is the opposite
television,removed,good premise executed fairly well my pet peeve with the show is that they paint aaron tveits character like a dream man come true to overcompensate for the things he has to do tony shalhoub is very good on his role summer show in general
television,removed,even as a european socialist i think the democratic dicksucking makes it unwatchable
television,removed,but she died
television,removed,yep it seemed to me like she was a late addition to the whole shows outline and they just plugged her in a few places personally i think it couldve been interesting if she ended up helping will growing from the experience learning bravery you know an arch i had a hard time with how little character development really happened in the show
television,removed,man shut up japanime nerd
television,removed,just dont watch it okay you obviously dont care take your downvote and get outta here
television,removed,well if youre too much of a wuss to watch horror then the show isnt for you you big ol baby
television,removed,mildly extraordinary items
television,removed,its cuz im da bes
television,removed,ok me and my wife have very different taste in moviesshows i admit that most of the time we watch stuff together we do it just because we dont want to drift apart and almost always one of us is making a concession we binge watched this show in one sunday for the first time in my life i knew how it feels to share the experience of watching something with my wife without my ass getting itchy thats how good this show is
television,removed,but really was there a chance of an anthology spoiler at the end theres the scene with the kid puking some alien shit into his basin theres the shot of hopper putting in the waffle snack for eleven would they actually put all that needless foreshadowing if they were going to make an anthology series
television,removed,havent watched gotham past the first couple of episodes and i sincerely tried to get into agents of shield but lost interest after season arrow started out good got better then imploded and is not worth watching legends of tomorrow had promise but got terrible as well daredevil and jessica jones are top notch really cinematic quality in every way better than most of the marvel movies in fact i love flash and its really hitting its stride no pun intended and supergirl is really taking off ok pun slightly intended that time
television,removed,tldr ༼ つ ◕◕ ༽つstranger things articles take my energy༼ つ ◕◕ ༽つ
television,removed,aka its a cash cow and well milk every last nickel out of it until we destroy it and everyone hates us money its about money screw the fans
television,removed,and thousands of dollars to spend on the best deck as i quickly found out when my friends started playing and i thought a competetive deck was all i needed was fun for a little bit then they got right into it and started building insane decks and spending i went fuck that and havent touched my cards since
television,removed,thanks for the reply lets say i buy that motivation though lets say it was subtle but there in the film that means hes saying i wanna beat the shit out of whoever i want whenever i want im always right fuck you if cap was a fucking commentary on the difference between romanticised america and present america okay thats pretty good then but either way hes the bad guy in his own movie like ive said before elsewhere he signed up for the fucking army he signed all his rights away and wanted every minute of his life to be directed by someone else and everything else that comes with army life so again going with your motivation that means caps powers have given him a fucking god complex and theres another reason like with the creation of vision hes not always right so at best cao had bad motivations and was the antagonist of his own film
television,removed,kodi
television,removed,an eric andre show discussion where reddit mistakes random and awkward for comedy
television,removed,i am ultraman
television,removed,uthndrstrk is glad that guy died in a fire
television,removed,another typical leftist dont make points just character attacks progressives socialist are factually the most evil people in the last its ironic when they say right wingers have dark thoughts while voting for the party that defended slavery the kkk jim crow fire houses attack dogs ghettos dixiecrats you guys turn killing babies into a business for petes sake the socialist nazis used to rip the gold fillings out of their victims mouths after they killed them
television,removed,alternative free of them will be piracy i am ok with this
television,removed,tbs cant afford original comedy
television,removed,shes pretty cunty
television,removed,the advertising industry is a picture perfect example of the most delusional excesses of capitalism they take short term gains in exchange for long term losses this is a great example might that obnoxious commercial work in the short term to get people to pay attention sure just like how the first pop up ads were highly effective so to was this in the short term in the long term it is suicide shitty ads like that are why people cut the cord and never look back shitty internet advertisement is what drove people like me to finally throw up my hands and block nearly everything if everyone had used google or reddit style ads i would never have even thought to bother with an ad blocker ads just got more and more annoying to the point where sites became physically unusable i cant read fucking text with moving shit all over the page i sure as shit wont tolerate sound because of obnoxious ads i now block nearly everything short term profits long term losses
television,removed,dont worry he dies in episode or
television,removed,hes right tho most of those shows on cn are a circle jerk of calarts kids and people suffocated on that incestuous aesthetic of comedy for man babies rick and morty is probably the only cartoon on cn that isnt complete garbage alsolike the other dude said its adult swim
television,removed,because this is degenerating
television,removed,i binged the whole season totally awesome and only watched due to reddit where do they go from here though once they kill that monster and take care of the cia backed idiots at the dept of energy place which should be done by season then what im afraid they pull a lost and get totally stupid so far though the story is excellent
television,removed,i liked that as well it was just on the good side of annoyingly stereotypical that i stayed invested real people even high school jocks arent let me fuck you or im leaving and shows that write them that way are really obnoxious hes clearly that character and yet its written in a realistic way where he has bad influences in his life and is used to getting what he wants but still has a bit of a conscience and can be a good kid when he actually stops to think about stuff his two friends seem to be the trope which is still annoying but it at least shows us some context for his character
television,removed,is it something along the lines of fuck you were not telling you anything i just started so strong and let me down so hard
television,removed,what do we say to the god of death lyanna bitch i only know one god whose name is stark
television,removed,the style of the show makes it feel like its actually from the i dont know how they did it but this doesnt seem like a show it feels like im watching something like the thing its a great show
television,removed,with how they mixed in a flash image of the other dimension imo that is another way he has changed he is now a humandemagorgon hybrid
television,removed,literally hitler
television,removed,spoiler alert jeez
television,removed,thing is its easier to kill off the protagonist one sesson in than it is seven seasons in people are going to die but the majority of major players are there for a reason and cant be bumped off as matteroffactly as ned or robb
television,removed,this is a good move this past season had a lot of filler with truly important moments spanning less than a couple episodes of screen time hopefully the reduced number of minutes aired helps trim the fat
television,removed,
television,removed,is there gonna be any auditions for it
television,removed,the series has sold million copies as of april not exactly a small percentage whenever twow gets released that book is going to sell at least million copies within the first couple months thats a pretty big paycheck
television,removed,i actually am hearing a lot of people switching to hacked firesticks and stream boxes this is just the public version that netflix is releasing ill be willing to bet dont want to advertise your competition
television,removed,john defeats bolton hodor diescersei blows every one to shitit end with dragon queen heading to westeros with a new army
television,removed,when i say it doesnt have any meaning i mean in relation to the plot it could just be how he diesleaves the show in got characters die all the time for no other than to die as grrm even said about quentin martell in the books he death was sudden and unexpected to show that death is a part of life the writers might have written him out because people have to go you cant just have every character make it to the end especially in got he could very well come back and im not saying he is dead i just said i dont think he will because it seemed like goodbye and it was a perfect end to his storyline in my opinion
television,removed,all shall despair
television,removed,the curse is now broken i dont knowfirst the cubs now this what if these are the first signs of the apocalypse
television,removed,has anything been definitively said about what network picked it back up yet from what had been said earlier this year it seems like netflix would be the most likely but the linked article doesnt mention anything other than its availability on netflix still gaining it new viewers
television,removed,what i feel like when im running up from my dark basement at night
television,removed,fact no but it is something the reddit hivemind will believe without evidence might still have sex was never the line she was upset about that bitch is the line she got upset about go ahead and show me evidence that supports your claim your claim is she only said was upset at him calling her a bitch after she was caught in the act of lying lying about what
television,removed,httpsgfycatcomimmaterialscratchyaardwolf
television,removed,checks date not april set hype thrusters to maximum
television,removed,there are two relevant lines a made her famous b made that bitch famous kanye receives approval for line a kanye never receives approval for line b swift is not a liar because kanye uses an unapproved line there is a meaningful difference between the pronouns that bitch and her kanye never requested permission to use the pronoun that bitch swift is not a liar and her outrage at the grammy awards is justified
television,removed,sometimes i pee in my own mouth but only if my grandparents are watching
television,removed,as the show ages the characters become more and more extreme versions until theyre just parodies of themselves yes but when people say that they usually mean shows that last years community started having extreme versions of its characters be season and mainly relied more on gimmick episodes
television,removed,i thought it was a fun subversion to shift that sort of preachy do you guys not realize what is happening in africa right now archetype and actually poke holes in it and show how people really react to the friend thats always preaching to them about their cause of the week you mean exactly what cheers did back in the and all in the family ironically did in the
television,removed,but the plots showed that they had no idea what to do anymore yep just like really community college you get diminishing returns after years
television,removed,but chevy refused to shoot it and so they had to cut it since they had no time left thatc because dan harmon kept everyone late for the last day of shooting like he did every time for the last years dan harmon is probably the worst boss in the history of television
television,removed,
television,removed,that chevy chase has a history of alienating coworkers and being unpleasant to work with he just doesnt seem to have a filter and he seems to think that hes the star of whatever hes in even if hes not you could literally say the exact same thing about dan harmon except you know harmon wasnt an alist star but instead has a major drinking problem
television,removed,yeah i liked it when it seemed like one offs when it seemed the show was more about stuff that happens at an actual community college instead of just set at a community college with a bunch of wacky shit
television,removed,ok but i was just correcting you because its way more common for this subversion than not
television,removed,watch this new channelhttpswwwyoutubecomwatchvqblgxfyufm
television,removed,andy in parks and rec had this happen too still funny but they made him literally retarded
television,removed,yes
television,removed,i still cant believe people got upset for him using the word nigger its not like he was using it to offend anyone
television,removed,download it
television,removed,a couple dozen
television,removed,i dont know do you
television,removed,what do you know about me based on my profile you can see that i am a trump supporter i dont like tv and i am familiar with mits open knowledge program objectively how does this make me human garbage
television,removed,i love extract watch this slut
television,removed,c o n s e r v e conserve
television,removed,clearly youre a failure at life and a whiny bitch
television,removed,keep on being a theif one of societies shit stains
television,removed,firstrowsportseu youre welcome
television,removed,he knows that better than anyone and thats coming from me i pirate literally everything except games i could do i could emulate everything but steam is so convenient and in many cases quite cheap gaben knows
television,removed,as well as rnflstreams rnhlstreams rnbastreams rmlbstreams
television,removed,so say liz does come back from the dead hopefully she doesnt will she be like i want my baby back wheres my baby oh sorry your baby has spun off to another series
television,removed,its fundamentally impossible to enforce those laws you cant even stop people from taking shakycams of movies in theaters you will never ever stop people from stripping drm and distributing content when you make it available right in their homes nobody is taking anything either data can be copied a nearly infinite number of times at essentially zero cost thats whats fundamentally different about digital goods as opposed to physical ones if you dont want to produce content then dont nobody is making you if people are pirating it too much then put up a patreon and dont release it until you consider it financially worth it
television,removed,thats just active aggressive exactly
television,removed,hes just autistic
television,removed,hes an opinionated comedian whose idea of research is asking another buddy who checked twitter once
television,removed,am i the only one here who thinks that episode is by a trillion miles the worst episode of any of the seasons go ahead and chick that down arrow
television,removed,i hope your mom gets cancer too you know from all the sperm she eats every day and if you have kids i hope they get leukemia so that your dna doesnt actually spread around kill yourself

television,removed,youre an idiot
television,removed,upvote for you kind sir
television,removed,welcome to our fucking generation christ i wish i could smack that user on the fucking tit
television,removed,oh i didnt realize that when you say stuff like nigger get the nigger fifty years ago wed be hanging you upside down you didnt mean it in jest i apologize for misrepresenting you
television,removed,is one of the most innovative tv episodes in years tv includes game of thrones silly goose try reading the title of the thread next time
television,removed,look if youre posting on reddit looking for advice about what shows from the you should binge watch your time isnt worth anything
television,removed,i always thought that was super creepy and inappropriate
television,removed,it was meth actually
television,removed,in a very douche way
television,removed,rather than read whatever it was you just posted im just going to say that there are better ways to talk to someone and not come off as a douche nozzle you may want to work on that
television,removed,there was also a little bit about cosby in rock which buress either wrote for or had some contribution other than being a homeless character every once in awhile
television,removed,youre a disgusting person statutes are removed with dna evidence only im sure they made that up too huh
television,removed,how can you as a black man take life lessons from a show about a black family whose father stuck around
television,removed,yea we can circle jerk now in a hivemind from anywhere together its powerful how we can ruin lives with a single shitpost cosby had his coming but the power of millions of idiots together can have bad results in other cases
television,removed,i recently found out is was in the whole on christmas eve when i was with family i thought he would be rich like jp
television,removed,pretty much lol
television,removed,haha well when i was a kid i had an imaginary friend named slammapumpo gutmeredith guy tried to tie me up and rape me in a dumpster but i wasnt havin it so i gave him a taste of his own medicine turns out the entire time i was splitting a rat apart by its slutty little anus with my thick cock lol
television,removed,season game of thrones
television,removed,hey awesome another person who does this if i watch a movie i have to do my sets and i if i game im on a stationary bike thats the rules in fallout its like im running leveling up in the game and in real life at the same time
television,removed,i got you
television,removed,wwwpakistanexplorercom
television,removed,please check out our documentary growing up drake
television,removed,chuckled here and there throughout the whole thing absolutely lost my shit at that still not thinking this show will make it it just i dunno ill give it a shot i guess
television,not_removed,it has its place the same as any other breed of sitcom its just a particular offshoot of single camera parks rec and the office might have worked without it but i think they were better off with that format other shows wouldnt be
television,not_removed,i dont think mocumentaries are the way of the future considering this is spinal tap came out in they are just one option that gets reused a lot personally i could do with less pained glances at camera
television,not_removed,i would like the form to be utilized more but for now it just seems like another device that mediocre sitcoms are built upon
television,not_removed,i agree that it wouldnt work with certain shows it needs a particular setting to work i just dont want to see shows do it for the sake of doing it
television,not_removed,american crime story the people vs oj simpsonstranger things mr robot fargo hannibal the hollow crown game of thronesblack mirror sherlock
television,not_removed,was orphan black really the best that came out of what about house of cards
television,not_removed,justifiedboardwalk empire game of thrones idk lol the americans fargo better call saulmr robot westworldatlanta
television,not_removed,i would have put stranger things on though
television,not_removed,i like the black mirror pick in almost any other year i think i would have chosen black mirror but i just couldnt go against gots first season ive also never seen the people vs oj series so i cant speak to that pick
television,not_removed,i see your point vikings was also a good one in i just thought that tatiana maslanys performance in orphan black was incredible and s i had no clue they were clones for quite some time
television,not_removed,have you been watching westworld dont get me wrong stranger things was phenomenal and very unique but i think that westworld has smash hit for hbo written all over it when i was talking with my buddy about this he said that westworld feels like lost except that the questions that the show has created feel answerable whereas lost just kept provoking questions and they never seemed like they would be answered and most of them were not
television,not_removed,i would disagree yes the overall coverage of the dumpster fire that was the rnc was great seth was particularly good the dnc on the other hand felt like week of the rnc instead of mining the incredible material in the dnc leaks it felt to me like they were just trashing trump again dont know about anyone else but trump bashing is getting old and just isnt funny anymore
television,not_removed,i get what you mean but heres the thing even on his clips that ive seen its pretty clear hes got some strict rules to follow and its holding him and his show back hell the eric andre interview pretty much spelled it out with how much he was holding back and even making jokes about it you wont ever match conan or kimmel or whoever if you cant go where they go colbert could be the classy host which is admittedly what the other guys dont do but he could do it without being neutered by his network colbert is charismatic and smooth as fuck so its a damn shame his show isnt better
television,not_removed,whats good for civilization is bad for comedy
television,not_removed,convention week is like shooting fish in a barrel if a comedian cant spin comic gold from these two weeks they shouldnt be on television
television,not_removed,colbert is painful to watch
television,not_removed,agreed hillary or the dnc can have controversies in one week if trump says one obnoxious thing that same week he will get of the coveragejokesimpersonations from all the liberal latenight crew its gotten so old ive stopped watching most of those shows like bill maher daily show etc because the trump circlejerk is just too predictable
television,not_removed,i feel like colbert has been the worst at overcovering trump it feels like hes just helping him now by giving trump so much press the left really needs to stop being so obsessed with him
television,not_removed,could you elaborate on what you mean by holding back use the andre interview example
television,not_removed,totally its like the boy who cried wolf the left that cried trump if you will
television,not_removed,both of their normal energy was calmed down a lot eric made a comment about saying f and colbert laughed it up with the whoa this is live thing eric came back later with his weed can you say weed on here comment colbert seemed like he was nervous and at the ready to reign eric in rather than interview him
television,not_removed,huh i didnt read it like that at all eric was knowingly winking at his own reputation for being unpredictable by being overly pc it was still vintage andre even if he didnt take his dick out but the show was being filmed live for convention week making anything that would trouble the censors much more of an issue so it only makes sense that the subject would be broached in an interview with a guy known for pushing the boundaries besides colbert isnt known for being a filthy comedian so i dont feel hes being held back by censors
television,not_removed,i loved this show and my secret identity as a kid
television,not_removed,holy shit that theme song brought back a flood of repressed memories thank you
television,not_removed,thanks op i have a vague memory of watching this as a kid but could never remember the name of it
television,not_removed,you know burt reynolds voiced the alien father
television,not_removed,i didnt remember it until i heard the first couple notes of that intro song wow talk about a flood of memories thanks for that
television,not_removed,this show has a very special place in my heart ﻿
television,not_removed,wow i remember this show holy cow that was a cheesy opening wasnt this the show with buzzzz
television,not_removed,if you liked her in this you should see her a little bit older in teenage bonnie and klepto clyde
television,not_removed,wasnt that intro most of the intro to buck rodgers
television,not_removed,mayor applegate was the inspiration for troy mcclure on the simpson facts
television,not_removed,i cant believe ive never seen this hilarious i love kevin
television,not_removed,ramen flavor packets on mashed potatoes this man is a genius
television,not_removed,imo it only counts if olivia munn is there
television,not_removed,i only give a shit if sarah lane and kevin rose is there
television,not_removed,oh no do i now have to find out what twitch is and how to view it
television,not_removed,only if she plops out her boob again
television,not_removed,exactly what i was thinking unless sara and olivia are going to be having the kind of rough sex the latter dreams about im not even interested
television,not_removed,yes old techtv was best tv ruined it
television,not_removed,twitch is a website where people stream video games its free to view
television,not_removed,was also better before the merger ruined both networks imo
television,not_removed,every time or attack of the show is mentioned anywhere on reddit we see comments like these always
television,not_removed,always
television,not_removed,personally i found the lead actor very mediocre boring even i also found the pacing to be slow and even though the world building was good the story was just very average to me i just found nothing about it compeling its ratings were also dismal even by syfy standards
television,not_removed,i think the acting was not memorable also many episodes were just filler
television,not_removed,no he was the best doctor
television,not_removed,such an underrated doctor sad to see him go
television,not_removed,the option to continue to watch the credits of of something i finished annoys me as well if i get to the end and click back to browse it should consider that finished instead of using my ratings netflix seems to prefer the because you watched x method i didnt find that useful when amazon started doing because you viewed its not great on netflix either their data seems to allow them to make good choices about what content to develop why cant i get a row of personal recommendations
television,not_removed,it amazes me that a very common google search is whats on netflix youd think they could easily address what is on their own system a quick and easy list to look through for upcoming movies and shows but people use the internet and other sources
television,not_removed,i think it depends on the platform for me and pc are pretty good not sure about mobile right now amazon videos interface is my favorite ive been spoiled by xray mode
television,not_removed,i too have grown annoyed with netflixs interface but amazingly it is the best out there on a pc i use hbogo maxgo cinemax epixwhateveritiscalled hulu amazon this one is the absolute shittiest of all and all of them are clunky as shit dont play well with different browsers and are a bitch to use it seems to me someone could make a lot of money cleaning up streaming interfaces
television,not_removed,its still better than all its competitors imo i havent used the one you mention but its miles ahead of say amazon hulu or hbogo only thing i might argue is plex but thats sort of a different thing sure there are things they could tweak for the better and the algorithms could be smarter but overall its the most polished functional experience ive seen the netflix interface is the least objectionable part honestly im much more annoyed with the content or lack thereof
television,not_removed,this has not been my experience maybe its you
television,not_removed,ill forever be baffled and infuriated by the lack of a random option let me rewatched always sunny in a random order for the time
television,not_removed,i have no idea but agree
television,not_removed,many original netflix platforms no longer receive updates and some platforms get trial early release interfaces so that is a good point
television,not_removed,so is carrie fisher in it i thought both of the seasons were good i like the limited run of each season
television,not_removed,when does it return in the us anyone know
television,not_removed,first season was awesome second was mildy interesting for me
television,not_removed,yay
television,not_removed,agreed i didnt like second season as much as the first
television,not_removed,is this the season that ends in the murdersuicide
television,not_removed,yeah i think this was the last thing she was filming before she died
television,not_removed,april
television,not_removed,fuck menus
television,not_removed,it really was astoundingly good i think more people would watch it if they realized that it comes from rectify writers and banshee producers
television,not_removed,one of the best shows of for sure
television,not_removed,it was an incredible ride too bad its likely over at this point seeing as certain individuals have moved on to other projects
television,not_removed,i love this show the acting and writing are so so good if it seems like it drags its because the pacing and pauses in conversations are realistic
television,not_removed,loved it really hope we see more because that finale was wow
television,not_removed,does it work as a series finale given that as others have pointed out here its most likely over kept meaning to watch this show week to week but other things got in the way
television,not_removed,so so good i was surprised by it reading about it back in the summer i expected it not to be one that i watched but i gave the first episode a go and ended up looking forward to the next one every week i think its as good as the knick imo it could do with a little bit less gratuitous sex though some of the onscreen sex went on a very long time and was boring and unnecessary the short season is a bit annoying because i wanted more i hope it gets a season if anyone out there likes slow drama directed and shot nicely but still very much a plotdriven show and with scenes full of tension and action then it is worth watching the series
television,not_removed,quarry rambo meets fargo thanks will check it out
television,not_removed,some scenes of this show in a motel were shot in my small hometown in southern louisiana i live two blocks from where theyd shoot and my parents would send me pics and videos of trailers and crew milling about pretty neat i dont catch cinemax so i havent been able to watch yet unfortunately
television,not_removed,i just finished the finale a few minutes ago and damnthat was powerful sometimes sickening stuff you described this show perfectly op i hope it gets a second season
television,not_removed,ive never heard of this show ill look into it
television,not_removed,definitely one of my favorite shows on television right now the finale reminded me of that film the hurt locker
television,not_removed,will i like the show if i didnt really like banshee
television,not_removed,thank you for this recommendation i was looking for something new to binge on
television,not_removed,that long scene without cuts was skillful but also so hard to watch the show really impressed me i was already a fan of banshee but i really like how quarry took some of that aesthetic and grounded it a little more in a realitybased setting
television,not_removed,best show of the year
television,not_removed,i watched episode and it was oki loved banshee but it just didnt grab me the same way does it get better
television,not_removed,i brought up how awesome it is last week but i got downvoted to oblivion
television,not_removed,it wasnt that great
television,not_removed,whats rectify
television,not_removed,it comes from rectify writers i was not aware of that no wonder i like it so much
television,not_removed,i think more people would watch it if they realized that it comes from rectify writers and banshee producers you mean two good shows with teeny tiny fanbases
television,not_removed,that just sold me rectify is so good
television,not_removed,were the other seasons of rectify good i only saw season
television,not_removed,damn i was really hoping for more
television,not_removed,yes the last episode is basically the length of a movie and it wraps everything well but it still leaves enough in case it gets a second season but yeah it has an ending if thats what you mean
television,not_removed,it works if they never make another episode the finale is still a satisfying resolution with some areas of interpretation and a few questions remaining it could definitely have a season though and hopefully it will
television,not_removed,its based on a series of pulp novels so it could go on for a long time based on the source material if it is renewed
television,not_removed,let me say that i only included fargo because of the criminal aspect people getting in deep shit but everything else is entirely different fargo has a dark comedy aspect to it that makes it unique despite touching on some heavy issues and moments of intense drama but the atmosphere of quarry is entirely different but the drama is there its very grim more like true detective in that aspect or training day
television,not_removed,depends on why you didnt like it if you didnt like banshee because the action was ridiculous and overthetopunrealistic and was kind of shallow in terms of character development then quarry is very different from that the action scenes in quarry are more realistic the shootouts are quick and brutal it also has some good character development
television,not_removed,its a slow burner and yes it does get better
television,not_removed,if you have a chance to bing watch it do it
television,not_removed,points upvoted lol one person downvoted you probably the rest didnt bother
television,not_removed,a lot of people loved it myself included it just wasnt for you the show just has something to me that kept me wanting to come back every friday
television,not_removed,okay maybe not its a really subtle show about a guy who gets released from death row after decades and tries to reintegrate back into his family and society in a small georgia town comes on the sundance channel id definitely recommend it if you like deliberatelypaced character studies
television,not_removed,
television,not_removed,its just justified but with more ass stuff in it
television,not_removed,yeah i was waiting to give it a try once the season was over but then i heard that and immediately watched it so glad i did both shows are like masterclasses in tone
television,not_removed,yeah but combine them and thats probably not a bad audience pool for a sundance show
television,not_removed,ive loved every bit of it if you dug the first season id be surprised if you didnt enjoy the rest the final season is airing now
television,not_removed,i like how they sparkled some posible future plotlines here and there but it was still written like it could be a series finale thats how you do a finale the right way ill be so happy if it gets a second season though
television,not_removed,thanks ill definitely start watching it
television,not_removed,lmao to oblivion he said
television,not_removed,thanks for checking still sucks that no one is giving the show a chance praying for season
television,not_removed,i love rectify its straightforward about what it is and what it intends to do its beautiful and heartwrenching and it handles its mysteries well but i wouldnt call it subtle
television,not_removed,butt stuff
television,not_removed,not seen justified is it worth it or only appears to people who like century cowboys
television,not_removed,im not sure i see the where youre getting that theyre vastly different shows
television,not_removed,agreed i want to know what the black guy is going to do with the money or how the gay guy is going to handle his existential crisis they were both handled so well but im not pissed we didnt get complete closure with them either so much good tv these days
television,not_removed,well i was using subtle more as a shorthand for describing the tone and pacing deliberatelypaced was closer to what i meant i just didnt want someone to interpret it as slow probably overcautious it is subtle in places but overall yeah its fairly straightforward about everything except the big thing
television,not_removed,i know is he talking about burros or butt stuff
television,not_removed,justified has modern themes but its set in the backwoods of kentucky so it has a western vibe to it im not huge into westerns really only like the amazingly well received ones but its one of my favorite series its top notch television
television,not_removed,rectify really
television,not_removed,i think the word deft would describe what you meant better it is definitely very deft at handling its pacing and the big thing
television,not_removed,yeah that works definitely
television,not_removed,farscape scifi show by the jim henson company and its influenced a lot since it was cancelled guardians of the galaxy is pretty much farscape the movie basically also everything in the show had repercussions especially later on in season and when they were getting a better feel for it all lots of nonhuman aliens and the show ran on rule of coolfun
television,not_removed,the wire the americans the shield the sopranos
television,not_removed,six feet under breaking bad mad men house fringe gilmore girls arrested development taxi scrubs
television,not_removed,top off the top of my head with a bias towards newerish stuff dont crucify me for forgetting things drama the sopranos the wire deadwood six feet under breaking bad mad men the shield the americans justified fargo comedy arrested development rock the office parks recreation its always sunny in philadelphia bojack horseman veep louie atlanta the simpsons up to a point arguable where it stops being essential bonus round avatar the last airbender yes its a kids show yes you should absolutely watch it anyway bonus edit round band of brothers
television,not_removed,the shield
television,not_removed,three prime examples would be hannibal knick and the leftovers they are art no fluff no teenager horseshit drama no procedural boredom infesting our screens since tv series overtook hollywood unique masterpieces
television,not_removed,game of thrones westworld true detective season only supernatural sherlock black mirror house of cards stranger things and finally a show nobody so far has mentioned for some reason the man in the high castle
television,not_removed,community
television,not_removed,friday night lights
television,not_removed,lost
television,not_removed,out of all time buffy not only because its a great show but because of the groundbreaking it did at the time many shows now owe their origins to buffy from daring to go against formula to being able to weave long arc stories with smaller character arcs there definitely is a before and an after buffy era of television a really good shownthe first season of veronica mars probably one of the most perfect season of tv ive ever seen
television,not_removed,fringe community fnl the leftovers black sails orphan black fargo
television,not_removed,twin peaks
television,not_removed,damages seasons all wrapped up in a bow
television,not_removed,battlestar galactica the version the last season doesnt live up to the same quality as the first three season but its a great show nonetheless
television,not_removed,mad men
television,not_removed,the wire twin peaks its always sunny in philadelphia fargo westworld and taboo for a new series
television,not_removed,gilmore girls is my favorite show of all time but i do understand why some people dont like it im always appalledshocked when i meet people who have never seen friends
television,not_removed,essential tv dramas include sopranos the wire mad men breaking bad but youve seen that game of thrones lost comedy the office parks and rec community these are shows i feel like everyone should watch at one point or another even if you dont end up liking them haha
television,not_removed,firefly leverage
television,not_removed,doctor who
television,not_removed,scrubs one of the best sitcoms of all time
television,not_removed,frasier its the only thing you must watch before you die
television,not_removed,all in the family cheers himym
television,not_removed,narcos is really awesome
television,not_removed,id also add firefly as a guardians of the galaxyesque show though with no aliens just dont get too attached
television,not_removed,what are arrested development and scrubs about
television,not_removed,all solid shows would add community since its a personal fav tho
television,not_removed,ive already watched avatar i enjoyed it tbh what are the sopranos and six feet under about
television,not_removed,whats knick about
television,not_removed,for game of thrones id like to wait until its over so i can binge watch it all if a show is too good id hate to wait a year or more for a season i was watching house of cards but lost interest in the beginning of season tho maybe ill try supernatural
television,not_removed,what is it about
television,not_removed,what is it about
television,not_removed,i was going to get into it but everywhere i read about it i saw that the ending is very dissapointing
television,not_removed,is it binge watchable
television,not_removed,im going to ad eureka to this list i watched eureka before fringe but i liked how they both completely effed up the worlds they lived in
television,not_removed,ive never seen friends ive tried to get through the first episode several times but it just doesnt clicks on me
television,not_removed,it confuses me a lot i dont know how to start watching it
television,not_removed,why
television,not_removed,my only problem with narcos is that as i am from latin america i already know a lot of things about pablo escobar so i think it will feel a little repetitive for me but i may give it a try
television,not_removed,scrubs is a funny doctormedical show
television,not_removed,yeah i toyed with community and a couple others in place of rock in particular just personal preference listing honorable mentions would have been too much each is a lot of shows to get to
television,not_removed,sopranos character study of a modern early technically mafia boss main character is the best writtenacted character in tv history imo really paved the way for most and later drama and set the standard for writing etc on tv six feet under a family that runs a funeral home very poignant examination of death
television,not_removed,eh the wire is just as big just not as flashy or spectacle heavy if you want spectacle movies still do that better i like got but its not in the same tier of writing
television,not_removed,its a comedy about a study group at a community college like parks and rec the characters become the show come for early and awesome donald glover stay for epic halloween episodes
television,not_removed,its centered around a coach and high school football team in west texas but really its a beautiful portrait of different people in a small town
television,not_removed,so many people have said that but heres an unpopular opinion for you i actually enjoyed the ending of lost but i think even if you dont end up liking the ending the show is still worth watching
television,not_removed,honestly that is pretty much a myth i feel like of the people that say that it have never watched the show and just heard that the ending was bad also there is a very common misconception among just about everyone who hasnt watched the show about how it ends that is false i believe there are even other tv showsmovies cant remember which at the top of my head that reference how it ends but are completely off base imo the ending was very satisfying and most of my friends agreed with that obviously there are some people unhappy with the ending but i feel as though those are the people never satisfied with the ending of any show mainly just because they are sad its over yes not every loose end is tied up by the end of lost but to me it wouldnt be lost if there wasnt mystery surrounding it and besides most of the loose ends have to do with the island itself which is supposed to be unexplainable lost does a fantastic job with character development which is the best part of the show its an ensemble cast but you get to know the characters bettter than just about every other show ive seen id definitely recommend it
television,not_removed,lost has plenty of issues the ending honestly isnt one of them unless you watched a different show than i did
television,not_removed,i dont think you need to start at the first episodeits very different from the rest of the episodes as they dont all know each other like they do for the rest of the series i would try something from the second or third season maybe the one where no ones ready thats one of the earlier ones thats also one of the best episodes and shows off the group dynamics pretty well or maybe the one with the blackout if you want season
television,not_removed,yeah the show went off air sometime in and they rebooted it in id recommend starting with series episode rose from the effects suck and its kind of cheesy but thats part of the charm of the show if its too hard to watch maybe try starting at series episode the eleventh hour which serves as a jumping on point for new fans and watch from there
television,not_removed,haha xd also lost but its a super long show maybe stranger things but breaking bad is absolutely awesome
television,not_removed,im aiming to give it a try do people die in this show
television,not_removed,something that is exciting since the first episode if i get bored in the first episode i just lose my interest
television,not_removed,yes
television,not_removed,this guy fucks
television,not_removed,pretty soon his irl car will open up like this
television,not_removed,find a map locate australia look up
television,not_removed,what is the easiest cheapest legal way of watching this show starting from the first episode
television,not_removed,i wonder why none of the cops have guns
television,not_removed,that skinned lady was freaky also that dudes ass
television,not_removed,sign up to starz for a month you can just watch it via starz play however if you do that i suggest watching black sails as well its one of the best shows on tv
television,not_removed,starz has a pretty cheap plan just like hbo go
television,not_removed,why is illegal off the table
television,not_removed,thanks
television,not_removed,because bruce campbell is awesome and i want to do right by him
television,not_removed,yeah bro lost is good
television,not_removed,lost is a great show to rewatch although i still miss the days when it was a new show and people were talking about whats in the jungle what do the numbers mean and whats down the hatch it was one of the first big talked about shows that i remember came out perfectly for when i was at school
television,not_removed,i never watched lost when it was airing when i finally did watch it it was five years after the end of the last season in i bought the bluray collection and had a marathon watching about episodes per day for about days one of the best times ever
television,not_removed,in my opinion its the best show ever made
television,not_removed,watching and the spoiler after the final season knowing its the mib trying to manipulate the survivors for his own goal makes the scene so much better in my eyes
television,not_removed,their airing schedule was pretty bad i remember someone even made a website called httpislostarepeatcom so you could easily check if it was gonna be a new episode or not just discovered that it still exists and has a cute final update now on the other hand one of the things i loved most about watching lost as it aired was discussing all the mysteries and clues with friends and coworkers ive never watched a show before that garnered so much discussion and speculation and its something that you wouldnt really get if you were bingewatching it on your own and that kind of thing is one thing i miss in general with bingewatching shows now which is one reason i still have mixed feelings about services like netflix releasing an entire season all at once
television,not_removed,i think its more emotional with each rewatch as well everything seems to come together better and better and the viewer isnt trying to put together nearly as many pieces so its easier to notice little things and make sense of it all i will watch this show probably every few years forever
television,not_removed,i just finished my watch a few minutes ago tears in my eyes i cant comprehend why people dont like it
television,not_removed,i agree its a very character driven show and no matter how many times i rewatch it i get sucked right into it i would also argue that every season is at least good and the finale deserves way better than it gets
television,not_removed,lost is the best show ive ever seen probably ive seen it like times total
television,not_removed,i never understood why people hated the ending people seemed to want some cold calculated scientific explanation for every little detail i enjoyed the spiritual ending best episode was ab aeterno
television,not_removed,lost was just a really good show the next time you watch it again i recommend watching chronologically lost instead it is a guy that has done a lot of editing and has made a version of the show that is told chronologically
television,not_removed,no
television,not_removed,that ending tho
television,not_removed,i like to think that the mib appears in the episode where hurley sees his imaginary friend trying to get hurley to commit suicide however i think lindelof mightve debunked that so its my head canon
television,not_removed,whats the point the way lost kept going deeper and deeper both in the past and the future is one of the best aspects of the series it diminishes the story to break all that into one linear storytelling from point a to point b the show is perfect enough as it is
television,not_removed,dark ufo
television,not_removed,its one of the reasons i could never hate the show like other people did i had such a fun time watching the show and joining in the community discussions something about that show makes you want to find another person and talk to them about it
television,not_removed,i would not recommend a firsttime viewer to watch it no but if you already know the show and just want to appreciate it all again i would actually pick the chronological version and no it actually doesnt diminish the story in fact the overall storyline becomes much much clear when you see everything chronologically my gviggest issue was the flashes not because they werent interesting but most of the times i just wanted to get back to the action on the island because that was still much more interesting
television,not_removed,and no it actually doesnt diminish the story in fact the overall storyline becomes much much clear when you see everything chronologically it does for the simple reason that the show wasnt written to be told in a chronogical order the most obvious example is in the very first episodes of season in the first lockes centric the whole shock at the end comes from the fact that throughout the episode you had no idea the poor guy was crippled watching lost in a chronological gives it away before he ends up on the island that alone goes to show that it must not be told in a chronological order and should i even mention the long buildup until you see that guy in a white shirt under the statue regarding the flashes i gotta admit i felt the same way
television,not_removed,i understand all that but if you are rewatching the show you already know he is in a wheelchair it does not come as a shock to you i already said i would not recommend first time viewers of the show to see it chronologically but for someone that has seen it all and knows how it will end it is very satisfying seeing the whole story being told from start to finish especially the background stories told in the flashes become much more satisfying since they arent spread out over the entire show but are being told in one big segment and the origins story or whatever you want to call it with the man in black also stands out alot more clearly
television,not_removed,storewise it was great i have been disappointed with many of the ahs seasons cause the storyline got too discombobulated hotel does have a lot of blood and killing but the characters are great the way everything comes together in the end is awesome
television,not_removed,me personally i feel it was worth it for lady gagas acting she was fantastic i feel she will be nominated for an emmy i havent watched ahs since the first season and coming back to the show to watch this with my roommate was fun and im now sad i didnt watch seasons the storyline didnt bother me it was campy at times certain scenes i felt fx went farther then what would be allowed on cable tv for me it kept me interested as to where ryan murphy would take the show next in a good way i enjoyed it as much as season
television,not_removed,season is my second favorite after season storyline is much more coherent than in the last two seasons the main cast is great as always especially denis ohare and evan peters who are absolutely fantastic and lady gaga is a surprisingly good replacement for jessica lange
television,not_removed,there are a few twisty plot things that are interesting and theres a lot of killing not sure if thats the gorygross stuff or the creepyscary stuff for you worth watching if you like the liz taylor character if you dont care about her now you will before long there is more of this march character who is creepyscary and thats worth watching too give it another couple of eps and then see if you feel more invested or not
television,not_removed,was it actually creepyscary or did they just do gorygross niether really i mean yes it has moments of both but the first episode tonewise doesnt match the rest of the show which was more of a tongueincheek melodramacharacter piece of course its silly and theres a lot of oddbad moments but thats just ahs i found it very satisfying and the best writing since season
television,not_removed,i think its one of those seasons where you either love it or you hate it anybody ive heard or read that watched it they loved it including me it has either been their favourite or secondfavourite but and then the other half ive seen have all said its awful and its the worst season yet i havent seen very many opinions in between so i think you should try it because thats whats so great about ahs everybody has a different favourite and each season really is very different
television,not_removed,to my own surprise this was my favorite season of ahs
television,not_removed,i liked hotel i put it on the good side of the ahs ledger with house and asylum but if you havent seen other seasons and you didnt like the first episode or two because you objected to the content im not sure i would bother
television,not_removed,more violent gross than scary if thats your style
television,not_removed,watched the first episode only so i cant comment on the season as a whole but i must say ryan murphy and co gotta learn a thing or two about being subtle and that being in your face isnt always the way to go
television,not_removed,started great but the last few episodes were done poorly but i guess thats the case with most of the ahs seasons ahshotel is my third favorite season though i loved the theme of the season i loved how erotic it was lots of sex and nudity lady gaga surprised me with some great acting
television,not_removed,absolutely not worth watching the worst ahs season by far and thats saying something
television,not_removed,better than or but still nowhere near season or still a bit too unfocused and chaotic too ridiculous though this time bearable as usual not a lot of horror and dread mostly just perversion blood and gore meh
television,not_removed,worth it like getting a degree in a field you hate its a show watch an episode or two and continue or not
television,not_removed,the story was discombobulated in this season too
television,not_removed,i was going to say almost the exact same thing as you the season started off very strong with maybe one of their best premiere episodes but in typical ahs fashion it got messy and clusterfucky somewhere in the middle and never regained composure still was better than seasons though
television,not_removed,take a chill pill
television,not_removed,that was essentially the advice i gave op
television,not_removed,jeez these comments are annoying obviously im not gonna die if i dont watch or watch it but dont like it but whats the point of watching a miniseries which may not be very good overall yet has no effect on the grand scheme of things i liked asylum and coven freakshow was alright murderhouse was decent they all do their own things if hotel was whatever i can skip it and watch it after season or or never if it was good then maybe id watch it now
television,not_removed,shut your mouth and watch an episode how much do you get paid an hour that minutes of your time is too much to gamble will we lose the cure for cancer do you only have a week to live you have probably spent more time looking at this thread than watching one single episode of the season in question
television,not_removed,my god there are other things than watching this tv one of them being watching other tv idk if you understand this but episode season i clearly said i watched the first episode and was wondering if other thought it was worth overall if you dont have anything to contribute why dont you go be useless elsewhere im sure theres someone somewhere who doesnt need you and would love for you to be unhelpful
television,not_removed,the show has no end game they said no cure at the end of season by season zombies are no longer a real threat the comic can go on for however long it wants since drawing characters is no problem but these actors are getting old and there is no end in sight the filler episodes are blatant and show that they simple are stretching out the time just to keep this going it is so disappointing to see a show that had this much upside settle in to be mediocre they got big ratings nice money tons of fans so they got complacent to just spit out the same old same old hopefully this drop in ratings makes them step up their game
television,not_removed,obligatory fuck this show i stopped watching after season but im still here to complain
television,not_removed,fuck this show ill quit watching after season
television,not_removed,there is a cure turns out its groovy httpsenmwikipediaorgwikiashvsevildead rotten tomatoes gave season a certified fresh rating based on reviews average rating of the sites critical consensus reading true to the movies that spawned it ash vs evil dead is a gory hilarious and audacious resurrection of sam raimis beloved horror franchise season so far it has an average rating of on rottom site says the show is in command of its characters and tone turning up the gore fun and energy to deliver even more grisly actionpacked thrills and laughs its got the yucks and the yucks folks
television,not_removed,im watching it out of obligation at this point i watch it weekly but generally end up talking through most of the ep and in reality end up missing nothing of note anyway the way they structure their series is so frustrating and i think people are obviously now clued in on how it works big opener middle three cliffhanger two filler eps midseason finale big opener blah blah you know that you can essentially skip most of the season and it doesnt matter i absolutely loathe that they dedicate each episode to a different group of people how hard is it to intertwine varying arcs into a linear story you really needed an entire episode to show tara meeting another group of survivors only to show up at alexandria after minutes there is no reason why that couldnt have been woven into other episodes like with that hilltop episode last week negan is the big selling point this season and sure enough theyve managed to fuck it up when hes onscreen its a lot of fun and he certainly doesnt have to dominate every episode but placing daryl into a situation where it seems like he has no plausible escape only to wait every two or three episodes before we check in on him again is idiotic
television,not_removed,i found myself uninterested in last weeks episode i felt like i had to power through it just to get to the end they are obviously still doing well in the ratings department but the numbers in the article represent a concerning trendline hopefully they take notice and make serious changes
television,not_removed,i love itguess im swimming against the stream
television,not_removed,this show is just so much better still far from the best when you can binge it the pacing is just so completely fucked every season that it becomes a struggle to keep up with every week for me we got a glimpse of some interesting new characters in ezekiel and his people in episode and we havent seen them in a month now instead we got one of the most boring pointless episodes last week
television,not_removed,i also feel there is a lot of contempt the show has for its audience something i actually felt last season with glenns death and the cliffhanger ending and its finally beginning to dawn on the audience that this is show that trolls its audience my one tweet on how happy i am to stop watching this show got more retweets then anything else i put out
television,not_removed,im starting to lose interest in the show just as it hits the spot where i lost interest and quit the books i liked this last episode though tara is a fun protagonist
television,not_removed,im still watching because my life has no meaning
television,not_removed,yes i agree the pacing is too slow no not every episode is a throwaway its not perfect i enjoy watching most of the episodes season episodes also had glacial pacing and a few of the episodes really sucked like the glennenid episode and the aaronmaggie episode in general season hasnt episodes as pointless as those sometimes there are one offs about characters that are actually super well done like the tyreese death episode and the morgan origin story while its not perfect i still enjoy watching the show when its on some episodes arent as good as others perhaps dedicating a whole episode to tara was a bit much still i enjoy it much more than the reading various articles which seem to be in vogue that list all the problems the walking dead has
television,not_removed,too many character episodes based on the most boring one liner characters in the comic not to mention all the different focuses which arent in the comic and dont even happen leading to a less than focused plot the comic goes through loads of content pretty quickly the show just sits idle for ages on side story boredom
television,not_removed,isnt plummet a bit strong for one of the most popular tv shows in the world
television,not_removed,im not completely surprised because from what i hear they are doing an awful job with negan a badly translated negan hell maybe even a well translated negan can easily drive viewers away im still kind of surprised though i thought twd was untouchable at this point its very possible the midseason finale rakes in huge viewers because everyone knows it is the only important episode since the premiere though
television,not_removed,ugh get off the doom and gloom for the show its ratings are absurd its singlehandedly getting amc and their package of networks stupidly good carriage deals and the ad revenue is flowing in just a few make goods and youre all set oh did we also mention the show goes long plus has an after show to get even more ratings which means its even better than these ratings appear yeah that too oh and then all the free publicity like this article yawn you could have stinkers of many seasons and still be raking it in and the show is gonna run seasons easily
television,not_removed,i only got caught up because negan and ill probably stop watching after negans gone it just gets so boring sometimes
television,not_removed,i think it would be more interesting if they showed more government aspects of communities and more communities in general something like maybe an group similar to genghis khans empire or an ultra capitalist group similar to america
television,not_removed,this was my favorite show for a while but this season has been atrocious the whole storyline per episode structure irritates me rick michonne carol daryl negan the alist characters should be in every episode how are we halfway through the season yet carol a main character has only been in episode who wanted a taracentric episode im out after the all out war arc which im hoping gimple does well
television,not_removed,huh those zombies lasted seasons
television,not_removed,i love the show and even i have to admit that the last episode was weak overall it has been a great season though but i can see it wearing thin for the people who dont like the storytelling approach they took for this season
television,not_removed,the tone of the show changed as well the first season felt somewhat believable as far as such a story can be and it also was at times kind of lighthearted remember the scene where rick got stuck in the tank and met glenn on the radio for the first time speaking of glenn remember when he was a sort of comic relief as it progressed the new characters that werent templated cliches got ridiculous and cheesy eg the governor abraham probably a result of trying too hard to follow the comics they let too much of a comicinfluence in whilst ironically beginning to take itself way way too seriouslyconstantly moody and dark just for the sake of it without an ounce of selfawareness its like the writers got replaced by teenage emo kids we can return to glenn here as a sort of barometerhe turned into an irritating moody mope meanwhile shane the best and least irritating dark character on the show so far gets eliminated in season which id argue perhaps coincidentally everything started going down hill its stunning how bad the show is now relative to that first season if you watched one of the first episodes then watched one of the recent ones backtoback the dive in quality would be jarring
television,not_removed,not having an endgame is what did it for me when i heard that i stopped watching because that doesnt work on a tv show i want a characters arc to concluded as the original idea intended it to be not because an actor decides he wants to leave the show
television,not_removed,theyre not a real threat until the writers run out of ideas and need to fill minutes of an episode and make one or a small group of zombies suddenly a big deal lazy writing
television,not_removed,the zombies were still a threat last season when they overran alexandria and ate that hot blonde rick was macking on
television,not_removed,we can only wonder what wouldve happened with the series if darabont stayed at the helm instead of getting fired by amc who clearly wanted to milk the series for all it was worth using a director that would bend to every whim
television,not_removed,i felt this by season everyone else took so long to realize this lol the show was only ever watchable if you pirated the shows to watch multiple in a row so you could feel like something or anything had happened
television,not_removed,this situation almost sound like a live action version of dragon ball z
television,not_removed,i think the problem they made themselves is that the point is that the threat isnt the zs its people but they started off saying it was zeke then they switched and people dont like it when you do that
television,not_removed,the comic can go on for however long it wants the supreme irony is that the comics actually do have an end game but it wont be used for the show when i read kirkman say this thats when i decided last season will be my last as an active viewer read paying i quit cable so i was buying the season pass its clear the show is amcs cash cow and they wont let it end until theres no more milk to be had
television,not_removed,yeah pretty much got dull fast
television,not_removed,are you me
television,not_removed,why do people still complain about how the show is getting worse and there are waaaaaaay too many commercials there are people that will defend that show with their dying breath
television,not_removed,i will go through season but after that im hecking out
television,not_removed,thats a lot of referencing critics and ratings and scores and stuff when really anyone who knows whats up can watch the first ten minutes of episode and know exactly how great that show is
television,not_removed,i am enjoying the hell out of ash vs evil dead i love the evil dead movies and the show it spot on with what fans love and want bruce campbell is a riot
television,not_removed,it also has decling ratings makes me sad i hope it gets at least seasons deserves it
television,not_removed,the fact that they dont intertwine stories just kills me why didnt they edit this season so that there are communities being shown per episode without changing any of the writing directing or acting not even going to touch it i think editing the show to weave several arcs together per episode would improve it tenfold
television,not_removed,i straight up turned the episode off halfway through way too fucking boring
television,not_removed,i fell asleep and was in and out during the live showing time ive ever done this during a twd episode didnt even watch the dvr the next day
television,not_removed,or your palate for shows with better writing and content is limited
television,not_removed,million down to million in the space of a few weeks is extremely alarming
television,not_removed,they can still plummet from what they were before
television,not_removed,negan is actually ok just practically nothing has happened we had a minute episode that should have been at least cut in half then two episodes that could have been combined just boring dull filler
television,not_removed,i think would be a good number to stop at they should catch up to around where the comic is now and then after kind of do their own spin and end it somehow
television,not_removed,theyre only a threat when it comes to being in a situation due to human stupidity in any kind of controlled situation they arent a threat at all
television,not_removed,and right after that they just straight handtohand combat slaughtered every zombie because rick went into rage mode that was my last episode
television,not_removed,i argue that they arent since the prison they have basically trained people to deal with them and to get the head everytime if you remember the problem when the zombies came in was caused by humans running a truck and blasting sound to attract a horde zombies will always be a danger if they are in huge numbers but since the prison we see that as long as they get a base to work from dealing with zombies is mostly a chore they take turns doing
television,not_removed,this should be the top post
television,not_removed,i somehow made it through its farm season and flu seasons season i consider it a minor miracle
television,not_removed,am i
television,not_removed,and there are people who will whine about it with their dying breath so whats your point
television,not_removed,im not some apologist for the show i personally dont think its getting worse it just bugs me how i see people using everything to defend shows considerably worse yet when twd pulls something theyre all on its ass
television,not_removed,true it just sounds so extreme its an enormous money machine still its not like anyone is lacking a pool
television,not_removed,isnt that specifically a point the comics that humanity once regrouped can easily managehandle the walkers and that the real danger is the other humans
television,not_removed,theyre only a threat when it comes to being in a situation due to human stupidity in any kind of controlled situation they arent a threat at all being a vet or not doesnt help when there are hundreds unless you have a fucking dumpster to crawl under
television,not_removed,its like these people inhabit the same universe as the crew members from prometheus these zombies are fucking idiots people this shouldnt be so so fucking hard
television,not_removed,except they didnt slaughter every zombie handtohand abraham and sasha shot a ton of them and daryl lit a lake on fire to draw the zombies to it rick and everyone else would have eventually been overwhelmed had people not shown up with rifles and a rocket launcher
television,not_removed,youre taking this walking dead backlash pretty rough arent ya
television,not_removed,and yet they still get themselves killed by making stupid decisions often without the malice of others
television,not_removed,and that idea can only be reiterated so many times before it gets boring
television,not_removed,he rocketed a lake of fire not exactly the best use of a rocket launcher a match wouldve done the same but either way hand to hand did waaay more than it should have there was just zero thought put into that whole sequence
television,not_removed,
television,not_removed,if i was a therapist id tell them to delete their account and go live in isolation for a bit
television,not_removed,i find it hilarious you actually think this is a good diss
television,not_removed,its not a diss its a read
television,not_removed,surprised to see this one dont remember the last time ive seen a currently running cbs sitcom on us netflix
television,not_removed,i can finally watch it my dad loves this show the few episodes ive seen have been pretty funny it will be nice to actually watch it from the beginning
television,not_removed,is it like modern family as from ive heard thats how it sounds
television,not_removed,its on amazon prime for anyone in the uk very funny show and its recently been renewed for a season
television,not_removed,im excited always wanted to watch this show but had no way to watch it i am just as surprised as you
television,not_removed,ive only seen a handful of episodes so i cant totally speak for the entirety of the show but i honestly didnt really get that vibe its like modern family in that its a comedy that focuses on an extended family but the similarities seemed to end there for me
television,not_removed,ok someone was describing it to me that you see parts from each then it comes together in the end and that sounded like modern family to me which is a show i really enjoy
television,not_removed,i think if you like modern family then youll probably like this they do sorta have that aspect at least in the handful of episodes ive seen but it was different enough to not come across as modern family
television,not_removed,sounds and feels just like one of her characters on snl
television,not_removed,this probably from ucb days conan and andy were regular guests at the ucb theater
television,not_removed,yeah this bit ran from about to when andy left the st paddys day version of this bit was pretty great some pretty good sketches from those years
television,not_removed,this was pre snl i loved the hell out of these skits though
television,not_removed,im not in pr or marketing but i cant help but feel like the best way to get people to listen to what youre saying isnt shouting them into a random news camera also this isnt fox news its a local affiliate fox station that is not owned or operated by the cable network
television,not_removed,ive never heard of this character or diane morgan but ive just become a fan i love dry humor
television,not_removed,id never heard of this character before last nights then saw her show on after it was great
television,not_removed,crap i thought it was katherine parkinson
television,not_removed,im still waiting for the barry shitpeas spin off series
television,not_removed,reminds me of the bloke who rang the lass on babestation and started talking about biscuits
television,not_removed,it ruins the bit for me that prof brian cox is in on the joke
television,not_removed,that mole on her neck is super distracting
television,not_removed,while an unpopular opinion my god i cant stand the dimwitted painfully stupid act its the same in everything ive seen her in she genuinely ruins charlie bookers wipe every year for me
television,not_removed,philomena cunk joyous now thats a name for the harry potter universe
television,not_removed,
television,not_removed,
television,not_removed,shes done a special on shakespeare too and its great
television,not_removed,the wipe was my first one and i was wondering if those characters were old ones or not
television,not_removed,my wife audibly sighs every time i giggle when barrys name appears the characters need their own spinoff
television,not_removed,yeah i know many here are saying they like her but i feel there is a line between dry and stupid and i personally just find the humour not to my taste at all
television,not_removed,haha like nymphadora tonks
television,not_removed,the actress was great on wilty as well i once dumped a boyfriend because i didnt like the way he fell down some stairs
television,not_removed,yeah barry shitpeas and philomena cunk have been on wipe for a while
television,not_removed,mine too which is why i was surprised to see her show directly after it im guessing theyre not but my first binge watch of shall be all the previous newswipes
television,not_removed,it used to be a series highly recommend
television,not_removed,cunk has two half hour specials one on christmas one on shakespeare
television,not_removed,
television,not_removed,spoiler alert it was true
television,not_removed,i never tire of watching this show i remember crying when david was explaining about the coloured spots on a map
television,not_removed,great if i wasnt already paranoid about my appearance now i have to practice falling down stairs now
television,not_removed,what happened to don cheadle
television,not_removed,this is supposed to be loosely based off of michael hastings book the operators
television,not_removed,i know this is on netflix but is there a policy on films on rtelevision theres rmovies for movies and rtelevision for television series i wouldve thought this belonged in the former
television,not_removed,theres rmovies for movies and rtelevision for television series i wouldve thought this belonged in the former i think anything on netflix is allowed on rtelevision since its a streaming television service however only movies are allowed on rmovies
television,not_removed,maybe confused him with conan
television,not_removed,but then how would that change things
television,not_removed,well i hadnt watched it it seems she says homer was recently found to be catholic and was relating that to him as well so im guessing shes just trying to relate comedy and religion and that example came to her mind
television,not_removed,thats the only just thing i could come up with as well my shes smart its not often that you get compared to a cartoon character especially in regards to your religion and then two seconds later have to clarify how exactly part of your family died great woman
television,not_removed,you know i have fond memories and feelings for the show and characters but when i put on an episode i usually dont find it particularly good or funny
television,not_removed,friends was decent but i feel like how i met your mother built upon what they did and is the better sitcom for it
television,not_removed,in the event that youre serious people who work on shows often cant listen to your unsolicited ideas because you might decide to start trouble in the event that they happened to do something similar to your idea by coincedence i know that you personally probably wouldnt but somebody might additionally ideas from random members of the public are generally worth less than the time it would take for somebody to read and evaluate them again your idea might be good but the average idea isnt worth the time it takes to read it
television,not_removed,haha nice i thought you were serious when i first opened it but by the end i realized you were just fucking around you almost had me
television,not_removed,no one is gonna hear a pitch from some random guy you know how many hundreds of people try to pitch production companies shit every day you can try sending in a spec script then another then another thats probably the best option
television,not_removed,get an agent
television,not_removed,just ride up there on your steam powered penny farthing and tell them but dont say it too loud you might offend someone who self identifies as a whisper being
television,not_removed,sorry to say that people dont usually care about your ideas unless you get really lucky sending emails to people in the production is probably the best idea so if that does not work nothing will do not call them they will laugh in your face they get hundreds of requests like yours
television,not_removed,ugh that totally makes sense but bums me out to hear thanks for responding
television,not_removed,what
television,not_removed,okay thanks it isnt even a pitch and im not looking for a job or anything just a fan of the show with an idea they would totally do
television,not_removed,sounds good thanks for the response
television,not_removed,holy shit youre serious how old are you
television,not_removed,yeah you and every other pitch person saying this times a day plus their waiter at lunch their valet their neighbor next door
television,not_removed,am i just like super oblivious to how things work or something
television,not_removed,i guess i just never thought that many people would think they have an idea good enough to bring up or waste people on the shows time with
television,not_removed,ideas are nothing its execution which takes the effort they dont need or want more ideas and they are legally unable to take unsolicited ideas anyway even if this was a universe in which that was a thing
television,not_removed,yes very much so but youve had a lot of good answers in this thread from much kinder people than myself but in all seriousness nobody cares about your idea i say this not to be personally insulting but to be super real with you everybody has ideas all the time all day you want to contact the crew at portlandia to tell them your idea and its just that a premise maybe a punchline a line or two not only do you expect them to want to listenread a strangers idea you expect them to like it and even if they did like it and hadnt already thought up a similar idea you think theyll then write a sketch based off of the idea they were given by somebody else legally that would be dicey as shit but realistically why would they even bother i promise you whatever your idea is its just an idea something you thought would be cool this implies your idea would be more interesting to them than their own ideas like theyre just sitting around waiting for strangers to tell them what to write its like trying to contact snl because you have a funny idea for a trump sketch or trying to contact the writers of the flash because you have an idea for a cool episode with barry allen seriously man did you really think it was that easy to get your ideas produced by shows with millions of viewers you just had to call someone up write an email and tell them about it i know i seem like im being overly harsh and maybe i am but seriously man i foreal thought it was a joke after you contacted an agent and he sounded upset
television,not_removed,yeah lots hell people and companies that are well established and well known can barely get an opportunity to pitch someone
television,not_removed,deleted
television,not_removed,the last kingdom on netflix is pretty darn good imo
television,not_removed,id also suggest outlander but there is a lot less action so some may not find it as gripping i personally love it
television,not_removed,to expand on the ops point black sails is not just like game of thrones because it has tits and fight scenes it has a similar balance between entertainment and depth that allows for awesome fights and battles while also ensuring that simple conversations can be just as compelling its not a slowburn character study and its not action for its own sake its a little of both id be remiss if i didnt talk about the flaws of black sails first season the pacing is too slow for a supposedly actiondriven drama the early episodes have too much gratuitous nudity and swearing and character motivations can feel a bit opaque its still a decent enjoyable season just be aware that it wont blow you away season two is a significant step up because they fix all of these flaws i know that literally every single show ever recommended on reddit has a similar disclaimer but it really is true here the writers had more faith in their characters and they had a bigger budget for fights and battles season three improved things further and the first episode of season four suggests that the show will maintain that quality through to the end if theres nothing that you find interesting about black sails after the pilot then chances are you wont like the rest of the show however if youre even a little interested in the story or some of the characters or even the setting then keep going because it really does improve over its course
television,not_removed,vikings has been great havent seen black sails yet but its on my list ive heard the first season is a bit slower than the rest
television,not_removed,black sails has steadily gotten more exciting and wellwritten while vikings has become more and more bogged down with pointless exposition and boring subplots edit deleted spoiler that has caused me to lose all interest in vikings sorry
television,not_removed,it isnt a period piece but if you are in to pulp tv then i also highly recommend banshee yes it too is chalk full of nudity and violence but it is a helluva lot of fun and fires on all cylinders from the very beginning
television,not_removed,the only problem i have with vikings is that its on the history channel which edits out all of the nudity and tones down some of the violence does this air on bbcskytv unedited before hitting the us
television,not_removed,black sails is so damn good
television,not_removed,black sails i will check out but i know there are alternate cuts to vikings and i want to watch them uncensored how do i do this
television,not_removed,id recommend the show outsiders as well scheming for power betrayals and drama great show
television,not_removed,black sails has been better than game of thrones over the past couple years it is an excellent underappreciated show
television,not_removed,how does one watch black sails without a starz subscription amazon fucked us
television,not_removed,tried them both watched full first seasons neither did the trick
television,not_removed,do they have dragons or ice men
television,not_removed,i stumbled upon black sails and vikingshadnt heard of either and found both were really really good for me it was great not knowing any of the context of black sails as i watched it had no idea it was about treasure island or long john silverwas a slow realization
television,not_removed,that john scene was fucking epic
television,not_removed,and for people who are considering beginning black sails season starts off slow since they have to establish nassau and all its characters but once the plot starts it becomes freaking amazing
television,not_removed,im a big fan of black sails and vikings and watching first ep of last kingdom is just felt so unbelievably dgrade and bad was hoping itd be good too
television,not_removed,bbca production but yet to be on netflix in the us love the books that the show is based off of
television,not_removed,i avoided outlander because it was based on romance books so i thought i would not like it at all boy was i wrong starz has some great shows
television,not_removed,its amazing and deserves so much more attention
television,not_removed,lol which one of the shows are you talking about here you dont mention it once
television,not_removed,i nearly quit black sails after watching half of season and it was only towards the end that i started liking it but season onward it became one of my absolute favorite shows not a single dull moment they even made the flashbacks gripping and interesting
television,not_removed,no doubt it gets faster as it goesfor me my only concern at first was how pretty they werebut oddly enough that fades too
television,not_removed,well shithadnt reached that point spoilers
television,not_removed,i think what might have hurt is that they were used to doing episode seasons so the plot used to move extremely fast ragnar would get the idea to invade some part of england and by the end of the episode they were already on the shores fighting at least a preliminary battle in season the episode order got doubled and the show sort of stalled and with ragnar becoming old they couldnt have much filler fight scenes so it became more psychological and spiritual stuff which is fun once in a while but not necessarily what we were looking for in vikings but i guess now that the kids are all grown up it will go back to being pure fun next season
television,not_removed,i just got my friend at work into this show and he has blasted through two seasons in one week he loves it im going to go back and rewatch at some point
television,not_removed,i quit banshee in half season had no interest at all to continue watching
television,not_removed,its uncensored on the history channel in europe
television,not_removed,try to find european versions
television,not_removed,hulu if you have it
television,not_removed,agree
television,not_removed,blazck sails season sucks season is where it gets amazing
television,not_removed,black sails ignores the mystic stuff that makes got so cool however vikings does have some mythical god shit that plays out ps does got really have ice men or more just the threat of them loomingoutside of hold the door who really cares about the ice men
television,not_removed,i liked rome but it didnt hold up well when i attempted the rewatch years later
television,not_removed,i presume you mean the one that involved a goat dont want to spoil anything if so yeah that was some genuinely strong film making got real intense almost gave me the abyss vibes
television,not_removed,first ep is kinda setupy i didnt really get into it until i think but different strokes
television,not_removed,i was pretty sure i saw it on netflix the other day at least season
television,not_removed,actually it is on netflix in the us has been for a few months now great show
television,not_removed,it could have very easily have turned into twilight or something but its actually great
television,not_removed,having seen both it sounds like he is talking about black sails
television,not_removed,oops my bad i was talking about black sails
television,not_removed,i did quit black sails after episode came back when i was hearing how good season is
television,not_removed,that was one of the things that turned me off the first season as well as the cheesy writing the show looks like the casting director called the nearest modeling agency
television,not_removed,oops sorry deleted spoiler
television,not_removed,but i guess now that the kids are all grown up it will go back to being pure fun next season maybe but i think theres also going to be more bullshit castle intrigue and ultrasoftcore porn
television,not_removed,excellent i did not know it was uncut on there
television,not_removed,theres much more to television than how big and impressive the effects are black sails is much stronger and more consistent with its characters and plot the only thing game of thrones does better is effects and frankly thats not enough for me to call it a better show lately than black sails
television,not_removed,the hero we deserve
television,not_removed,but neither are really fantasy shows
television,not_removed,while i will say you can only rewatch something so often rome still holds up season is fucking brilliant and season is very good but nowhere near as good with only episodes there is a lot less to forget or even see on future viewing compared to shows like mad men and the sopranos with their episodes
television,not_removed,well ill be damned i dont use netflix often but i had never seen it under new releases watched it on bbca but good to know one of the streaming services is picking it up
television,not_removed,whoops thanks for the info
television,not_removed,vikings black sails are both historical fiction with some fantasy elements sprinkled in but not blatant fantasy like got
television,not_removed,yeah it seems like it was under the radar on netflix i only saw it on a similar shows to list
television,not_removed,cersei being able to do what she did and get away with it made zero sense
television,not_removed,what fantasy elements are there in black sails
television,not_removed,thanks dont know why i got down voted for asking though
television,not_removed,what do you mean get away with it all weve seen is the immediate aftermath i have a strong feeling its all going to blow up in her face next season
television,not_removed,she should not be in this current position to begin with the idea that someone with zero allies could blow up the religious center of westeros and kill everyone inside including her own uncle and most of the current members of the most powerful and beloved family in westeros and then sit the iron throne is ridiculous ffs the people of that city rebelled when the lannisters were in a much stronger position than this but theyre not rebelling when she is all that remains and committed arguably the most heinous act in the series its fucking stupid no one likes her no one wants her and no one supports her but shes somehow ruling again
television,not_removed,and who is supposed to stop her exactly
television,not_removed,the thousands of people who live there the nobles who hate her the tyrell army which was presumably in the city the lannister army that was loyal to kevan she had no one but zombie mountain on her side
television,not_removed,its an kids toy show the movies are huge budget action movies if you like toy kids shows youll probably like it
television,not_removed,yes watch them
television,not_removed,the transformers hold more value on rewatch if you grew up in the and was a kid during that time back then the transformers were huge and every boy wanted the toys i did a rewatch couple years ago of the cartoon the original transformers cartoon didnt age well with poor animation and the stories were lacking however i still loved the generation characters and their original designs that i grew up with good to see again the dinobots contructicons megatron as a gun and to hear the whiny voice of starscream
television,not_removed,no you should not they are painful in everyway
television,not_removed,by war and fall do you mean the video games
television,not_removed,friends start with season
television,not_removed,thank you for your submission unfortunately your submission has been removed for the following reasons you might want to check out our
television,not_removed,actually ive watched all of friends and loved it dd thanks tho
television,not_removed,holy shit i didnt realize they would have actual trashy daytime court show style cases i thought they were gonna be jokefake cases this has potential
television,not_removed,episodes are only that sucks but it does look like there will be episodes a night starting tomorrow
television,not_removed,tooken
television,not_removed,omg the bailiff is dying 😂
television,not_removed,that was absurd i loved it
television,not_removed,wait its only minutes long i mean it was funny but that is kinda a let down
television,not_removed,gosh dangit im in australia some one hack into the matrix and give me a link please
television,not_removed,she didnt even clear it
television,not_removed,this was amazing cant wait for more episodes
television,not_removed,that was the biggest piece of crap
television,not_removed,by god im psychic
television,not_removed,i honestly think this will be quiet entertaining
television,not_removed,looks like episodes a night starting tomorrow
television,not_removed,i enjoyed it but keep in mind it was only the first episode its a nightly show so i believe it will get better as it goes on
television,not_removed,you may be referring to the national adds that get preempted by local ones in the local market they typically run seconds so you end up seeing the last second of the national ad
television,not_removed,some affiliates charge local sponsors full price whether the entire ad runs completely or if it airs for seconds
television,not_removed,yes this is what is happening just for complete fun there actually is a way to buy very short ads as a gimmick some beer companies have done this on the super bowl
television,not_removed,i wondered whether they were some sort of subliminal ad meant to have us all out buying copper socks
television,not_removed,i dont know why but i was strangely obsessed with this show and every episode was the same
television,not_removed,wtf will i watch at am now
television,not_removed,there was definitely a certain amount of exploitation to this series but it definitely educated me to the kinds of people that end up in jail society likes to paint our criminals with one broad stroke but this show actually gave them a voice
television,not_removed,i sure this will certainly stop them from playing it anyway for the entire sunday lineup
television,not_removed,im fine with this
television,not_removed,typicalcancel the only good show on msnbc
television,not_removed,back when i had cable id bingewatch hours of lockup yeah sometimes they slip by an episode you know you just saw hours earlier but same content same difference i had no idea they had been on the air for years
television,not_removed,theres a msnbc and hillary clinton joke somewhere in here
television,not_removed,good what counterproductive fearmongering filler that show was
television,not_removed,thank god maybe msnbc could try to be a legitimate news network now
television,not_removed,they would just have it on hours at a time and i swear half the time they just replayed the same episode but it was just so damn fun
television,not_removed,msnbc has already embraced hillary
television,not_removed,and bernie was our last hope now were stuck with corrupt hillary and the destroyer of political establishments
television,not_removed,true
television,not_removed,days for season to come out i am actually pretty excited
television,not_removed,i just rewatched season so ready for this to come out syfy is really killing it in terms of shows this dark matter monkeys even magicians hope this level of quality doesnt end
television,not_removed,that is not how i imagined her armor but its close to how i imagined her
television,not_removed,presented with limited commercials what a selling point
television,not_removed,i am hyped af for season
television,not_removed,i havent read the second book yet was that scene somehow related to calibans war
television,not_removed,im really struggling to pick up the series its very slow and i find myself starting it then stopping it over and over i am usually a fan of the slowbuild but having a rough time with this one maybe i should give it another shot
television,not_removed,is it all coming out to netflix straight away
television,not_removed,the space parts were fine i could get into them the thomas jane part just felt like standard syfy garbage it was just terrible same for that un lady the acting chemistry directing are all pretty bad the pacing is like penny dreadful bad without the great everything else i can tell they are trying to be a slow burn but its just a boring crawl
television,not_removed,having ripped through the books in the mean timeman we have a lot to look forward to action more action chrisjen avasarala being herself what that stuff is who that dude is
television,not_removed,i hear so much praise for monkeys but im so afraid to start it
television,not_removed,i am just glad that for once i saw armour in a science fiction show actually you know protect someone the number of filmsshows that have soldiers decked out in amazing looking armour only for it to be as effective as a t shirt is ridiculous
television,not_removed,i expected it to be a lot bulkier looking but extremely manueverable and graceful kind of like starcraft terran marine armor
television,not_removed,likely it was in a sense the divisions between book one and two are being rewoven it seems to allow a lot of the characters from both books to be a part of the second and first seasons
television,not_removed,if i remember correctly this is how book starts im glad they dont give away the next part of this scene
television,not_removed,first few episodes are definitely a bit slower id say things really pick up around the second half of tbh the crew of the cant is way more interesting than the ceres stuff at least to me
television,not_removed,i couldnt get invested in any of the characters
television,not_removed,i felt similarly i powered through and it got better in the second half not only that but upon repeat viewing it has made more and more sense my understanding of the universe and events of the conspiracy through viewing and have really helped my critique of the first season would definitely be that i felt thrown into the foot deepend it is a thick universe unique languages cultures new governments etc which you arent really guided through too well imo i dont need my hand held but i do feel i was thrown into the deep end i would have loved a prologue episode online only or on syfy that took minutes to explain to you the status of this universe what has happened since to create this version of the galaxy who are the players mars earthun belters in this universe and so on give me that introduction considering the first season throws the viewer into the deep end
television,not_removed,if you can push through to episode it picks up from there
television,not_removed,not even tjs hair
television,not_removed,no
television,not_removed,the isnt a cw teen drama bs
television,not_removed,how did you possibly switch these two up
television,not_removed,it cant be standard syfy garbage its an adaption
television,not_removed,the thomas jane arc changes direction from pretty much the point that season ended it switches things up so you might get more enjoyment out of that the un lady i think suffered from her not even being in the book so her inclusion in series of the show was largely new material to give her something to do rather than just introducing her when she appears in the books
television,not_removed,even though ive read through the books i appreciate your candor in regards to spoilers
television,not_removed,i really suggest you try it out the time travel in the show is done very well and the main leads are very likeable and dynamic by this i mean that they change personality wise over the course of the show and their changes are very believable overall if i had to rate the current syfy shows i would put monkeys at a really close second behind expanse try watching the first few episodes if youre not hooked onto the story by then it might not be for you
television,not_removed,watch it its one of the best time travel focuses television shows ever made its just under the expanse in terms of quality definitely one of syfys best shows
television,not_removed,she has to get through ladders and hatches on ships not a lot of shoulder room when you pay for every gram in fuel a thousand times over
television,not_removed,exactly that would be cool to see
television,not_removed,nah in that trailer scene they are on mars doing a training mission which never happened in the book since bobbie first shows up on ganymede and well things happen
television,not_removed,yeah that episode is generally seen as the turning point for the series as it sets up the antagonists as well as their power plus it sets up the core main group of characters with their ship and mission
television,not_removed,i liked the story but i dont think i could tell you a single characters name fairly forgettable bunch
television,not_removed,his hair is the best character in the series
television,not_removed,the first eps are but then it gets a lot better
television,not_removed,im referring to the feel of the show or more particularly the planetcentric arcs in the show so since im going to assume youre trying to tell me its an adaptation that has very little to do with the production that went into making it and more to do with the overall story
television,not_removed,the un lady i think suffered from her not even being in the book so her inclusion in series of the show was largely new material to give her something to do rather than just introducing her when she appears in the books that explains a lot the show must have bad planning too i look forward to seeing the new direction for janes character but i mostly just hope he takes that hat off
television,not_removed,i think i might have to haha i know its different but i recently finished legends of tomorrow and ive been wanting to watch another time travel show
television,not_removed,you are correct apparently i wasnt paying attention to the trailer at all lol
television,not_removed,for a while then it becomes ridiculously over the top drama and characters making sudden character shifts with no development
television,not_removed,yeah exactly but op thinks hes too cool for school
television,not_removed,really how so
television,not_removed,did you watch past the first episodes or so
television,not_removed,dont know why that matters
television,not_removed,he took off the hat back in episode or
television,not_removed,check travelers
television,not_removed,legends of tomorrow will feel hilarious compared to monkeys
television,not_removed,if it was the scene you thought at first it would be a little more frantic glad we have some time with bobby pretrauma
television,not_removed,the is cw teen bullshit for the first few episodes but then it turns into a legitimately good show
television,not_removed,just because actors are teen and its drama doesnt make it teen drama bullshit stranger things had kids doesnt make it a kiddy show bullshit
television,not_removed,i think hes talking more about the fact that it seems like everyones fucking everyone on the its the type of show that includes gay relationships simply because sex sells not because theyre trying to show the hardship a gay couple might have to deal with
television,not_removed,will always make me smile
television,not_removed,such a good show i miss it
television,not_removed,i think my favorite would definitely be i like a good upbeat song about evil spellcasting its the kind of voodoo that we few who do ddew do
television,not_removed,tad coopers song is my favourite but the one in the second season where the episode cuts off as soon as they sing about ending on a cliffhanger had me and the group i was watching it with cry laughing i dont think ive ever laughed so hard at a tv show
television,not_removed,context for those who need it king richard was king then he went away to conquer some other land and when he came back he found out the townspeople didnt really need him to be king they kind of just voted on stuff and handled their own shit so now he needs a new job but he doesnt know how to do anything other than be king see if you can guess what happens in the next scene
television,not_removed,i thought they had filmed a second season before they cancelled it i guess i was wrong dang it
television,not_removed,the fact that that song isnt on the soundtrack is criminal
television,not_removed,i wanna see tad cooper
television,not_removed,the very ending was probably the best moment for me and the biggest teaser
television,not_removed,this is the second season
television,not_removed,they did and both are on netflix also this one is from season
television,not_removed,the guy with a british accent was great i wish there was more with him a crackhead that has a regal personality and good manners amazing﻿
television,not_removed,lmbo can you just make mines to go i shouldve picked my daughter up from school hrs ago﻿
television,not_removed,how you gonna borrow a french fry is you gonna give it back
television,not_removed,i was supposed to pick my daughter up from school eight hours ago﻿
television,not_removed,hahahaha oh man i miss the boondocks
television,not_removed,hey that crack head is based off dave chapell ﻿
television,not_removed,the guy with a british accent was great i wish there was more with him a crackhead that has a regal personality and good manners amazing﻿
television,not_removed,me too i wish theyd made a fourth season
television,not_removed,they did it aint good though but the final episode is goat
television,not_removed,i like how the leader for the gays name is sweetlove and the leader for the specially abled is slowlove who is also deboe from friday
television,not_removed,oh man the americans really broke my heart this year i just assumed nina would wiggle herself out of everything like she had done before and frank he was out goddamnit
television,not_removed,this is bullshit why do they think its acceptable to hit men on tv and everyone laughs god forbid a woman gets a well deserved bitchslap and people lose their minds pc culture is fucking up peoples minds
television,not_removed,not saying it should be censored from television but as much as game of thrones uses rape its become an extremely tired and arguably troublesome device
television,not_removed,bitch slapped isnt sexual violence i personally dont want to see women getting forcibly raped on television i dont want to see men getting forcibly raped on television those got scenes were horrible to watch and made worse imo when the people behind the show denied that one of them was non consensual despite the character saying nostop repeatedly in the scene i understand the context for the story but seeing someone bent over in tears and crying out in pain while someone is aggressively penetrating them from behind isnt entertaining
television,not_removed,how many rape scenes have there been i havent been keeping track but it doesnt feel like its been an egregious amount
television,not_removed,those scenes arent meant to be entertaining though they are difficult to watch but that doesnt mean they arent important to show i will say i thought the cersei nonconsent scene was handled and filmed terribly for what they were going for
television,not_removed,dont watch oz
television,not_removed,seeing a visual represetation of a story isnt something that should be in a tv show not sure we agree on that
television,not_removed,i wasnt aware we had to
television,not_removed,no it was just a nicer way of saying that seeing things happen is an integral part of storytelling on tv and any objections to that is objecting to the entire concept of tv storytelling a fundamental part of what got does
television,not_removed,the leftovers although depressing and emotional may be more accurate than just sad six feet under for sure though
television,not_removed,id say black mirror can definitely be depressing i can only think of one episode off the top of my head that has a happy ending and even then its kind of a matter of philosophy over whether its really a happy ending
television,not_removed,the walking deads first season is genuinely sad through good storytelling then every consecutive season makes you sad because its got bad storytelling
television,not_removed,bojack horseman
television,not_removed,the shield the first two seasons almost seem like a sitcom compared to what happens in the last three depressing but such a great show
television,not_removed,rectify and the leftovers mad men gets pretty depressing after season too
television,not_removed,moral orel
television,not_removed,top of the lake
television,not_removed,six feet under
television,not_removed,lost when it hits it hits pretty damn hard and say what you want about the finale shit still made me tear up
television,not_removed,transparent i binged it and felt depressed for like a week its a beautifully done show but calling it a comedy is a massive lie
television,not_removed,six feet under enlightened sometimes
television,not_removed,southcliffe an almost unbearably sad show so damn good though
television,not_removed,broadchurch
television,not_removed,for scenes within a single episode this segment of stranger things
television,not_removed,breaking bad poor jesse 😢
television,not_removed,derek hands down
television,not_removed,rectify from sundance channel its on netflix now too
television,not_removed,im dreading and eagerly anticipating the final season in equal measure such a show
television,not_removed,what was so sad about the first season the first season was good but sad is not the word i would use the apocalypse happens rick travels to atlanta a number of things happened in atlanta and at the camp we meet the whole crew an asshole wife abuser gets killed one of the sisters die and the group travels to the cdc
television,not_removed,who downvotes in an opinion based topic topics covered include rape incest self harm suicide child abuse murder work place bullying and on it goes all with a bleak tone and slow pacing
television,not_removed,one of the few shows ive seen that dramatically altered my view of the world holy shit there were several episodes that had me not just holding back a few tears but openly weeping
television,not_removed,finale made me tear up too because it was such shit
television,not_removed,the whole first episode was quite sad and a great use of visual storytelling in a mostly silent episode
television,not_removed,again what was the sad part
television,not_removed,its a subjective thing man u dont see it and i do i could sit here listing shit off or you could just accept that i found part of it of be emotionally draining or you could continue to interrogate me over a fictional show that really has no baring over my life though apparently it does yours
television,not_removed,its alright but its no cheesecake
television,not_removed,actually it appears that rowlfs hat is somewhat dark brown﻿
television,not_removed,the tv show was based off of a movie that im pretty sure was based off of a book the budget was probably not the best and the time they spent on each shot was probably minimal when you have one or two weeks to put numerous episodes together and you dont have the time or money to take multiple shots especially in action sequences then you have to go with what the camera was able to get
television,not_removed,the style of shooting is just cameras and go bascially
television,not_removed,just keep watching you will love it and wont care
television,not_removed,the game action footage is from actual games
television,not_removed,do you have a source i always assumed they were heavily choreographed so this would be really interesting to read about
television,not_removed,most of the first couple of seasons were shot around austin the first season games were shot at pflugerville high schoolstadium a suburb of north of austin about miles from me right now tons of broll footage is just various roads and sites on the outskirts of town httpwwwwhereverimayroamblogcomfridaynightlights
television,not_removed,wow thats super interesting
television,not_removed,i seriously want a squirrel girl movie the new comic series has been amazing
television,not_removed,rnewwarriors
television,not_removed,finally i do hope they keep her op though now i need her to show up in infinity war plus a live action livewires show and my marvel experience will be almost perfect
television,not_removed,squirrel girl vs thanos hype
television,not_removed,cant wait for this love squirrel girlshes hilarious
television,not_removed,comedy so i doubt well see night thrasher in it hopefully well see speedball
television,not_removed,we have black mirror
television,not_removed,for clarification this is from the episode skin and bones in which a farm loses a couple people including a father as they go out for some reason and a snow storm cuts them off the father returns with frostbite and begins to act very strangely the viewers are hinted at the start of the episode about wendigos and how they can posses people lost in the mountains the entire episode is fantastic
television,not_removed,i love black mirror but aside from the playtest episode its a different type of horror that typically errs on the side of dystopia
television,not_removed,i never expected to enjoy outlander half as much as i do its great to see that its still getting the attention and budget it deserves really looking forward to the next season
television,not_removed,thank you so much i cant wait for season ﻿
television,not_removed,now is the time we call droughtlander
television,not_removed,im really looking forward to seeing how they deal with the big chunks of times it seems easily enough done on paper but im not so sure how it will work on film
television,not_removed,this is actually something not really shown in the books yet as the story of what happens in culloden has been coming out in drips and drops
television,not_removed,is this show tailored towards women or will a guy who likes actionbattle scenes like it
television,not_removed,since theyre still sticking with the book a season format i have no idea how theyll cover all of voyager without glossing overmessing up key points a lot of people like the book the best but it was packed with too much ballstothewall plot for me
television,not_removed,i love the cinematography and the feeling of authenticity not that i know much about highlander culture in the century the acting is pretty top notch aswell
television,not_removed,id say its aimed at women but its not greys anatomy lots of dudes will like it the viewership is probably slanted towards women but not overwhelmingly so im a guy i watched it for a while i stopped but not because it was too feminine or anything like that
television,not_removed,its a total chick show but its an exceptionally well made one whether its good enough to rise above your feelings about the genre is for you to say
television,not_removed,its tailored towards women when it started out it had a nice mysterious vibe to it but as the main romantic elements started to form it became more of a romance novel but id say give the season a go and if it doesnt hook you in stop watching i dont know if ill continue to season but the story around the romance isnt all that bad
television,not_removed,action scenes are rare but decent probably better to find the clips on youtube than to invest the time for a whole season its a grocery store checkout aisle paperback bodiceripper though i will give it one unique mention the end of season one has the most fuckedup rape scene i have ever witnessed on tv or in movies its like the writers just said hey weve got minutes of scripted rape lets stick it in one episode what the fuck guys
television,not_removed,century
television,not_removed,exactly
television,not_removed,parents have gotten so weird as time goes on i used to ride my bike around town with my buddies and go to the theater alone when i was in second grade
television,not_removed,i dont even care that i dont have cable i havent been this excited for a dub in i dont know how long gokus va in japanese just makes the show unbearable to watch in my opinion
television,not_removed,haha vegeta is the main face on that logo
television,not_removed,so it starts at the same time as kai dubbed
television,not_removed,you can skip two season before the dubs is done with the whole battle of godsgolden freeza arc edit alternatively skip the whole thing and wait for team four star to do it better in or something
television,not_removed,get ready for some incredibly shitty animation its fucking terrible
television,not_removed,english dubs are for the illiterate
television,not_removed,one of the few animes where the english cast is soooo much better the decision to have females voice many of the adult male characters on that show is just mind boggling
television,not_removed,theyre using the dvd versions of the episodes so the animation will be better
television,not_removed,dragonball super truly a show for the intellectual
television,not_removed,riamverysmart
television,not_removed,and gohan and gotens voice and luffies
television,not_removed,the final clip is definitely worth watching in case clicked off before the end
television,not_removed,community
television,not_removed,will grace
television,not_removed,it was kinda popular show google it
television,not_removed,spoiler tag is pointless if you put the fucking spoiler in the title
television,not_removed,what is there to explain
television,not_removed,that was the headline on hollywood reporter i only used the tag because the story itself may contain spoilery information theres nothing in this title that ruins anything for you is there
television,not_removed,it spoils the orgy scene obviously
television,not_removed,ah you guys blow
television,not_removed,what episode was this
television,not_removed,its goin down season finale
television,not_removed,man i have to rewatch that one season i had on dvd and watched religiously but i didnt watch season as much
television,not_removed,umm so its basically just a youtube show this isnt tv
television,not_removed,given the choice id rather watch something like mythbusters or planet earth
television,not_removed,should have
television,not_removed,maybe he refused to be involved i mean it didnt paint him in a pretty light
television,not_removed,ill tell you one thing i did not want to feel bad for orenthal james simpson and i have to tell you that minutes of a heavyset aging oj looking humble talking about his prison chores might have been too much for even stubborn me honestly i do want an interview with himbut only if he would tell the truth or at the least be real i want to see that ice cold scary oj or that arrogant smirky disrespectful oj or in a dream world a repentent and evolved oj i just dont want to watch the sociopathic charmer lying it is exhausting and uncomfortable
television,not_removed,some transsexual inmate said she showed oj her boobs then gave him oral and that oj is a major celebrity in jail google will provide a dozen articles it could all be bs too
television,not_removed,it painted him in a completely honest light
television,not_removed,he did he never responded to letters ezra edelman sent
television,not_removed,agreed on a side note just watched tonights episode of the night of and they referenced an oj quote from the trial the show is fantastic highly recommended if you watched the oj special
television,not_removed,agreed i loved the series honesty
television,not_removed,there was a cartoon that came out when i was a kid called mina and the count it was a spin on dracula and cartoon network released a few shorts but never developed it into an actual series ive seen it on youtube as an adult and still think its a shame that it was never picked up for a full series
television,not_removed,i thought the sequel to clarissa explains it all was good it wasnt groundbreaking but i did like all the new characters and the direction the producers were taking clarissas life i would have preferred multiple seasons of that rather than endless seasons of sabrina the pilot is on youtube thats where i watched it its worth minutes of your life
television,not_removed,the utopia remake by fincher on hbo on paper looked like a killer pairing if i remember correctly it was even picked up as a series but budget issues between the network and fincher killed the product
television,not_removed,the corrections got a pilot from noah baumbach a few years back but hbo declined to pick it up which is a shame because the corrections is great and so was the cast chris cooper dianne weist ewan macgregor and maggie gyllenhaal among others also im curious as to where the american gigolo tv series announced a few years back went i love that movie and would be very interested to see if a tv show could tackle the same themes and tone that the movie did
television,not_removed,global frequency i saw the pilot a few days ago and it looked good
television,not_removed,just wondering have there been any recent backdoor pilots it seems so antiquated now true spinoffs yes but backdoor pilots seems strange in the current landscape
television,not_removed,the nutshack
television,not_removed,pretty sure that supernatural had a backdoor pilot a couple seasons back wasnt picked up
television,not_removed,yes there have been some recent backdoor pilots the blacklist had one that aired this may with famke janssen as a leader of a covert mercenary group the pilot was picked up to series and named blacklist redemption the cw had backdoor pilots for legends of tomorrow on the flash and arrow
television,not_removed,the office had a backdoor pilot for a shrute farm spinoff
television,not_removed,just last season agents of shield tried to spin off bobbi and hunter into their own show called marvels most wanted they wrote them off the show by saying s they had to disappear to avoid an incident with the russians then their spinoff would be them on the run unfortunately between the time all of that was conceived and the pilot was finished abc got a new head of programming who was pretty merciless about axing stuff that doesnt perform or test well and that spinoff was one of them she also moved aos into the tuesday night death slot but anyway sucks because bobbi and hunter were great characters frankly i find most of the characters on shield to be pretty good but still the cast was a little swollen by that point so removing them didnt hurt but now both those actors got fucked over because of that pilot
television,not_removed,yep that was supernatural bloodlines which was to focus on werewolves and shape shifters the backdoor pilot was not picked up in
television,not_removed,hmm very interesting thanks
television,not_removed,thankfully that show didnt take off and we got richard hendricks
television,not_removed,backdoor pilots are also very popular with franchises nowadays to introduce new characters for a potential spinoff to see how viewers warm up to them franchises like csi criminal mindsncis law and order and the chicago series on nbc all had multiple backdoor pilots characters from csi miami first showed up on csi csi cyber also had a backdoor pilot criminal minds had backdoor pilots for its spinoff criminal minds suspect behavior and criminal minds beyond borders ncis had backdoor pilot for ncis new orleans ncis new orleans had a backdoor pilot for ncis red that wasnt picked up to series chicago pd had a backdoor pilot for its spinoff chicago justice earlier this year chicago fire had a backdoor pilot for chicago med
television,not_removed,wasnt it ncisla that had the backdoor pilot for red or was that a different backdoor pilot
television,not_removed,you are correct i got the different ncis mixed up ncis la was the one that featured red
television,not_removed,i actually think its been pretty hit or miss this season but hero or hate crime was one of the best episodes ive seen in a long long time
television,not_removed,this gets posted about every days so no i dont think youre alone
television,not_removed,the most recent episode was a complete dud for me the only laughs i got were two light chuckles for the appearance of rickety cricket
television,not_removed,i feel like ptsdee and the gang tends bar werent as up to snuff as the first few episodes the other episodes were dead on though
television,not_removed,definitely a bigger fan of the older stuff but the always sunny cast never ceases to make me cry laughing its all fucking good
television,not_removed,if you like outrageous humor like sunny you should check out the detour on tbs
television,not_removed,its either this or detroiters on comedy central
television,not_removed,ptsdee and the gang tends bar were also pretty good
television,not_removed,yeah reddit has a serious hard on for iasip not that it isnt great although its not as great as it once was imo
television,not_removed,i agree this season is kind of soft compared to the previous ones but i am still a fan
television,not_removed,another supergirl trailer that reveals absolutely nothing for the new season
television,not_removed,whats pumpkinhead doing in this
television,not_removed,while i did enjoy the show i couldnt help but feel it was aimed squarely at a female audience with the whole love triangle arc firmly in the foreground throughout ill tune into season though i guess lol
television,not_removed,oh look finally a trailer for sg that actually looks half decent still doesnt change the fact i rather watch all of season of arrow again then this crap party﻿
television,not_removed,where is the new footagescrew supergirl and its trailers﻿
television,not_removed,a worse version of flash with feminist drivel thrown in
television,not_removed,lol
television,not_removed,yeah i felt the same way
television,not_removed,im not overly fond of sg either though i suppose there must be enough positive response to keep it going an extra season mabe this one will be better
television,not_removed,philip and elizabeth jennings the americans
television,not_removed,youre the worst for romantic the two leads
television,not_removed,elanor and michael on the good place sam and her kids on better things
television,not_removed,bob and linda belcher
television,not_removed,nora and kevin the leftovers
television,not_removed,walter blunt and harry blunt talk
television,not_removed,rebecca and paula
television,not_removed,ron swanson and breakfast meat i would characterize it as both romantic and platonic i am still in denial that parks is cancelled leslie knope forever
television,not_removed,blake and adam the voice
television,not_removed,cersei and jaime and cersei and jaime
television,not_removed,glenn and maggie the walking dead
television,not_removed,carol and phil last man on earth
television,not_removed,so good that the actors are in a relationship in real life
television,not_removed,the couple that handcuffst itself together stays together mostly except that time kevin was seeing someone
television,not_removed,haha yeah
television,not_removed,yall are just broke
television,not_removed,its called method acting lets just pray they arent so committed to their work that they are also russian spies
television,not_removed,your opinion doesnt mean something is overrated american remakes of coupling the it crowd peep show have all sucked because they took a dumber approach gracepoint is just a remake of broadchurch that only works for you because of an recognizable environment gracepoint sucked because it was unnecessary elementary isnt a remake of sherlock a three movie season against a episode season seems like a remake to you only the office did better then the original and again it is a difference of humor what you like is what you like but most english comedies are far better then their american counterparts
television,not_removed,doctor who comes to mind ive seen a season and i strongly disliked it overrated as hell what season did you see not necessarily trying to change your mind but there are some real stinker seasons doctor who is one of those shows where when its good its damn good when its bad its awful
television,not_removed,as americans watching tv from the uk requires us to be engaged the vocabulary and cultural references can be alien so its more work there is a need to infer from context or even replay a scene and google the language or cultural context i rather enjoy this but it precludes just zoning out in front of the telly i am willing to work at it as often the original uk version is far superior broadchurch being human or a similar but completely different story house of cards shameless bronthe bridgethe tunnel
television,not_removed,i prefer uk top gear and being human over us versions but i like both elementary and sherlock equally
television,not_removed,personally i love a lot of uk tv although im with you on doctor who but i can totally see why the higher production value of american shows would be more appealing to a lot of people
television,not_removed,ive generally preferred the american version i loved the us version of being human and i couldnt watch the british office because i dont know their slang
television,not_removed,completely agree with everything you said except i think the original office was much better than the us version also doesnt like sherlock besides op i mean crazy
television,not_removed,all in the family was pretty awesome i cant say if it was better then the original since i i havent seen it but it would be difficult for the british version to beat such a great show
television,not_removed,i very much agree was consistently good imho then it went downhill from there showrunner switch out and deterioration of writing quality despite an increase of budget now it just feels misguided like they rely too much on fan service and cheap gagscomedy rather than good narrative and giving the audience sufficient credit
television,not_removed,imo was the pinnacle of new who great season season before that were hit and miss but everything afterwards has been shit classic who can be hit or miss too i think its safe to say ive seen maybe of it and ive seen my fair share of both classics and stinkers but i think the worst ive seen in the entirety of the show has come from the recent seasons
television,not_removed,if i remember correctly it was the one where the weeping angels were first introduced i think it was the one or the one later on
television,not_removed,lol yeah that was series
television,not_removed,blocked countries ca canada au australia
television,not_removed,i just noticed that one of their other skits laron cant laugh uses mass effect music at the end of it
television,not_removed,the tears they burn
television,not_removed,good sketch but who is that blonde
television,not_removed,anyone got name of the blonde jeezus those are beautiful
television,not_removed,was there a deformed guy in this sketch because all i saw were tits
television,not_removed,we get it you like breasts
television,not_removed,i would love to see this whole episode
television,not_removed,paul rudd out of no where with the liner
television,not_removed,will ferrell does two sentences of ford impressions the rest is a conversation about something
television,not_removed,i really love this scene but never watched the show is it pretty solid
television,not_removed,sucks it only had seasons
television,not_removed,only a white straight man can wax nostalgic about good old days
television,not_removed,i am a huge fan of aaron sorkins work and enjoy the newsroom greatly but it definitely aired on june
television,not_removed,wait why does he think this generation is the worst though we didnt fuck it up you did we didnt even get a shot yet﻿
television,not_removed,america is not the greatest country in the world however its certainly not the worst either all our food is poised by corporate entities and filled with sugar our prison system
television,not_removed,never lived up to the potential went sideways in the second season and couldnt recover in the third
television,not_removed,i think its great the evolution of the main character is very interesting
television,not_removed,amazing first season then as with many shows the quality and writing get worse and worse
television,not_removed,it had its moments but for me it was generally disappointing especially near the end
television,not_removed,yeah i always thought this scene was the same kind of hackneyed the youth of today shit you could find in any elderly americans email forwards dont know why its so beloved
television,not_removed,they may not have been perfect but america was founded with best intentions and aspired to live up to it sometimes failing miserably and sometimes succeeding but always trying to do their best but then shit went crazy and people started doing things for the wrong reasons thats what its talking about not that it was some kind of utopia but that it aspired to create something better and then settled for believing it had instead of striving for improvement
television,not_removed,no im pretty sure there are plenty of people who arent white straight and male that enjoyed days before today
television,not_removed,yeah the days leading up to were only good for white dudes i remember waking up that morning telling my slaves to make me a cup of coffee and then forced myself on my arranged wife which i paid her father whole goat for really a steal if you ask me whoo boy them were some good ol days that only i can miss since literally everyone else was oppressed
television,not_removed,i didnt say to the exact day p but yeah i guess it could be interpreted that way
television,not_removed,i also think that you really sell the scene short by only showing this part the entire eight minute opening is some of aarons best work and jeff daniels deservedly won an emmy in large part because of it
television,not_removed,my cable company is in a pissing war with viacom no viacom channels which are like the of the channels worth a damn im about to cancel
television,not_removed,i never know who to root for on this shit
television,not_removed,paul allen is a tool
television,not_removed,who gives a shit start using torrents and put all these shit stations in their place
television,not_removed,well if they stop getting carriage fees they wont be making any content to torrent
television,not_removed,such a strong reaction what did they do to you
television,not_removed,trouble is once nbc is blocked by charter they will also block nbccom msnbc and any other site that might carry an nbc show thats what twc did to cbs a couple of years ago thats when i paid to have an antenna put on the roof and told twc to go f themselves
television,not_removed,we have timewarner and we still get cbs
television,not_removed,this was a couple of years ago i might go look at the the bill for putting up the antenna but im pretty lazy edit lazy about looking up the bill i paid to put up the antenna because im a pussy and terrified of heights
television,not_removed,whats up with rustin cohle and true detective on this sub these days
television,not_removed,lost
television,not_removed,the expanse edit will be coming this february
television,not_removed,ever watch the
television,not_removed,i initially was going to give you shorter run shows from as i thought this was a while im on holiday break type of ask and then there were none a bbc mini from the end of last year that aired on lifetime in figure i honestly thought hbo got it i love love love murder mysteries and this is some murder mystery goodness based on a book from agatha christie which based on watching this i need to read more of very cinematography good atmosphere pretty solid acting lots of intrigue i had a lot of fun playing along and guessing who the murderer was lovesick formerly known as scrotal recall the shows that ive most been able to relate to are the first seasons of youre the worst man seeking woman and this show a british romantic comedy with charm and likeability in spades the characters are nothing new an awkward protagonist the willtheywontthey plot with his quintessential girlnextdoor friend his horndog best friend nothing new but the three actors bring these characters alive oh yeah the premise of the show is that the main character finds out he has an std and is tracking down his former paramours to let them know so theres that seasons of episodes each marvels jessica jones the best thing netflix has done the best thing marvel has done movies or tv show i know thats a pretty damn bold statement with the caveat that i dont think too much of marvels movies theyre alright but save for winter soldier nothing mindblowing very cookie cutter starts off okaydecent but really hits quantum speed around episode onwards episodes izombie a zombie show from the creator of veronica mars oh hell yes the ageold story of a medical student who gets bitten and becomes a zombie takes a job as a medical examinermortician to get brains to eat and breaks it off with her fiance to avoid him seeing her fate that old story another case of the cast elevating the story rose mciver seemingly plays a new character every week she inhabits the personality of the brain she eats the quippy fun of her medical examiner boss is fantastic as is the chemistry between the two and her former fiance the chemistry between these actors are among the best on television it really seems like theyve known each other for years and spend all their off time together solid mix of caseoftheweek procedural with overarching storylines the finale just might be the best hour or of television i watched all year seasons of episodes each the good wife okay a longer television show for you to work through this year ive espoused this show and sang its praises for some time now okay okay before you walk away i know i know a show called the good wife on cbs hear me out yes the show starts off as a pretty standard cbs procedural but as they get the ground beneath their feet this show truly becomes something special if you dont want to watch x number of seasons before the show gets really good jump to season episode hitting the fan it was my first episode and holy heck what a first episode to watch the alltime best episode of the show one of those episodes that takes all the plots and characters and just shuffles them careening it onto different trajectories season are the best of the series i watched then binged on during a summer i would honestly probably go that route instead of waiting episodes before the show hits warp speed the impressive thing while watching season is that the acting was so good between characters that when a rift opens between them it was very evident to me and only after watching those first seasons did i then understand oh thats why soandso feels so betrayed seasons of episodes each halt and catch fire an extremely overlooked gem as much as i dont like walking dead i can at least appreciate it for essentially subsidizing seasons of this show think silicon valley except its an hourlong drama set in silicon prairie tx instead of silicon valley ca and set in the about making the personal computer instead of the making an app i binged on the first episodes and thats probably the way to go the first half of the first season is the show finding itself and then comes episode i think and i was just like wow the show found itself a fantastic core cast allaround but big props for kerry bishe and mackenzie davis best known for the san junipero episode of black mirror seasons of episodes each speaking of which black mirror this show got some notice the past month with the batch of new episodes call me a black mirror hipster but watch its first episodes christmas special with jon hamm the latest batch doesnt hold a candle with the first eps imo be right back one of my alltime favorite episodes of television emotionallydevastating ruined a certain recent movie for me because the premise was similar but executed far superior in the show broadchurch okay last one murder mystery which i stated above im a sucker for david tennant doing great work to make you forget he was the doctor olivia colman always great picturesque seaside british village mysterious cast with mysterious backstories opinions divide on the season but i felt the show did just as well in the second it managed to execute a tricky balance of segueing to a legal drama and i felt they mostly accomplished it looking forward to the season seasons of episodes each
television,not_removed,does syfy still do the twilight zone marathon ill be watching them on hulu regardless
television,not_removed,the wire
television,not_removed,this is rtelevision but turner classics is running a hitchcock marathon probably the best thing you could find that you wont be able to see for free any other day
television,not_removed,have you seen firefly yet
television,not_removed,most popular on imdb free on netflix up to season first show ive truly loved in a very long time
television,not_removed,stargate its of similar length and quality
television,not_removed,check out the magicians syfy has been coming out with some great shows lately
television,not_removed,justified fargo banshee
television,not_removed,for a current show i suggest syfys monkeys it has seasons so far and season will be premiering this summer awesome mindbending show for a finished show i recommend fringe it had seasons and since you liked the xfiles im sure youll like it the first season starts out almost like an xfiles clone but dont let that discourage you the show comes into its own and its extremely worth it
television,not_removed,rome
television,not_removed,frisky dingo truly bizarre scifisuperhero parody cartoon by the people who would go on to do archer episodesa pair of seasonlong movies full of running gags and subtle callback jokes including a great one involving steven segal the taliban and a penguin boosh
television,not_removed,entirety of the xfiles god damn thats impressive what other series have you seen if you want to continue with good lengthy series ill suggest the west wing
television,not_removed,mr robot animaniacs
television,not_removed,the last ship
television,not_removed,futurama since fry got frozen on december
television,not_removed,doctor who from an unearthly child on heh mr robot though
television,not_removed,spartacus the venture brothers party down black sails westworld enlightened justified the americans american horror story season only the sopranos soap the comedy all in the family the mary tyler moore show deep space battlestar galatica reboot penny dreadful the knick no snacking deadwood curb your enthusiasm mad men breaking bad monkeys stargate taxi cheers hill street blues the twilight zone bewitched i dream of jeannie the rockford files
television,not_removed,the leftovers not sure if hbo access is something youve got but definitely a great series seasons but hour episodes add up i just finished my rewatch a few days ago and i really had fun noticing a lot more details i missed out on or didnt pick up on the first time through
television,not_removed,wilfred its hilarious
television,not_removed,have you watched deadwood yet
television,not_removed,have you seen the killing i enjoyed that one
television,not_removed,troll hunters is great if your into animation and well written for all ages type shows
television,not_removed,letterkenny found it a week ago binged it in a day eps hard to find anything like it strange weird absolutely brilliantly stupid forget about anotations just watch the first episode
television,not_removed,scream
television,not_removed,the mighty boosh
television,not_removed,community parks and recreation scrubs the expanse man in the high castle
television,not_removed,i just finished rectify and loved every minute of it it has a few short seasons so its easy to binge and honestly one of the best over looked tv shows i can think of
television,not_removed,catastrophe very short seasons so real
television,not_removed,i like the james bond marathons for the holiday season the old light hearted ones
television,not_removed,theres just enough time to binge the before we hit season on february
television,not_removed,in the season of my rewatch 🙌
television,not_removed,if you like long dramatic series with lots of suspense and mystery lost is a great pick practically made for bingewatching on that note while i love the modern tv revolution and i think theres a lot of exciting stuff happening in tvland and far more great series coming out than ever before i have to say i dislike this trend toward shorter and shorter series once upon a time the episode seasons were standard then it seemed like more and more shows were shooting for the episode range now its not unusual at all for a series to be only episodes sometimes as few as episodes depending on the series some series like the recent stranger things are only episodes for the whole show thats not too unusual these days back when i was growing up we called that a miniseries and sure i get that some of these series probably have insane budgets and a show like say breaking bad or sons of anarchy might be costprohibitive to try to shoot twice as many episodes and the quality of televisions shows has indeed gone way up on average especially dramas scifi fantasy and the modern horrortv renaissance but im sometimes still sad that i cant get that feeling of getting lost in a seemingly neverending stream of episodes that i get when i start a series like lost which ran for seasons comprised of minute episodes i start a series of that length and i truly feel like i could go on watching it forever as illusory as this may be what kills me though is when i hear people praising short seasons or complaining about longer ones sure i get that everyone has a different opinion but i legitimately dont get the complaint okay if it was a clear choice between fewer episodes of a higher quality versus more episodes of a lesser quality id probably choose the former but ive heard people complain about the length of a series they legitimately claim to enjoy never once have i ever thought to myself something like gee this tv show is really amazing one of my favorite things ever i just wish there was less of it for me to watch not once ever and maybe sometimes this just comes down to the fact that i was interested in the sideplot while someone else thought it was meandering and unnecessary but generally speaking i feel like more episodes greater chance of awesomeness sure some episodes are hit or miss in any series even shows i really love some episodes i like more than others thats just how tv and storytelling really works but i think these lesswishers must assume that if a show was cut from episodes to that the episodes that disappear are the crap the dead weight but what if you and i just have different opinions on which ones are the crap episodes and which ones are the good ones anyway ive ranted long enough longlive longform television rant and yeah id totally second lost lol with the caveat that some people hated the ending
television,not_removed,i found one yay another watcher
television,not_removed,can also recommend broadchurch second season isnt quite as good as season in my opinion but i never thought it was as awful as a lot of people made it out to be what really makes broadchurch stand out from a lot of other crime dramas is the way the show is crafted it has some fantastic cinematography a gorgeous soundtrack and an extremely talented cast im not ready for the final series i dont really want to say goodbye to it just yet
television,not_removed,several times xd
television,not_removed,seen all three brilliant
television,not_removed,seen monkeys never finished fringe really considering it
television,not_removed,id recommend the last ship as well
television,not_removed,i tried to rewatch leftovers recently and had some issues with them being available i tried to watch on xfinity did you just use hbogo
television,not_removed,i have great show i really hope talk of its revival is real
television,not_removed,hi waves frantically we believe in jordan collier obscure scifi for the win
television,not_removed,okay some other shows ive liked that are also over now are almost human the tomorrow people terra nova the cape and v
television,not_removed,actually used a combination of hbogo when i was with family and hbonow at my place so both should have it without much issue
television,not_removed,may we both enter promis city
television,not_removed,check out the denver allen court parody ive watched it times already its flipping great similar shows doubtful rick and morty is pretty unique some south park is comparable and frisky dingo is worth a watch
television,not_removed,gravity falls is quite entertaining
television,not_removed,really good cartoons bojack horseman is my favorite and i really like archer and south park
television,not_removed,awwwwwwweee biiiitttccchhh scary terry
television,not_removed,futurama
television,not_removed,check out archer its awesome and has seasons
television,not_removed,i just recently started watching star vs the forces of evil fantastic show
television,not_removed,china il
television,not_removed,yes frisky dingo one of my favorites
television,not_removed,if you actually watched it times you really are starved
television,not_removed,agreed
television,not_removed,ill give those a shot was also thinking of bobs burgers or adventure timeregular show
television,not_removed,it takes a few viewings since its rapid fire jokes
television,not_removed,gravity falls is really good its kind of like rick and morty
television,not_removed,this summer is all i see they started in august in
television,not_removed,from their fb page today new episodes of adam ruins everything return this summer but for now heres an ask adam segment about that weird bird swearing thing they do if theyre not giving a date you wont get one from anyone else here
television,not_removed,i had actually not seen anything on the facebook page lol thank you
television,not_removed,flaked is a huge sob story
television,not_removed,wilfred
television,not_removed,youre the worst and crazy ex girlfriend both deal with depression though for their characters its a mental health issue rather than part of an existential crisis neither are anywhere near as heavy as the leftovers but they both offer interesting takes on the topic while still being very funny shows
television,not_removed,it isnt as in your face as it is with bojack but mad men probably tackles depression in a way i have never seen done before in media full stop you have characters who dont feel anything dont love their lives or families cant fill the voids in their lives or themselves and worstbest of all know that they shouldnt really be feeling those things because from an objective view they are pretty much on top of the world the show does all this without ever trying to really draw attention to these points or themes but rather just by showing you these characters going through their days and lives they have the good days where they have success and then they have the bad days where they spend it in bed getting drunk to cope they then show these characters having to get up and go through their lives even though they sometimes dont want to that is something i have never seen another show even attempt to do let alone do it as amazingly as mad men does
television,not_removed,its an anime but you should definitely check out welcome to the nhk the main character struggles with depression and other problems and he tries his best to change and become a better person also if you dont like reading subtitles the english dub is really good
television,not_removed,the film meloncholia is one of the best depictions of depression in film i have ever seen very powerful
television,not_removed,adult swims moral orels third season
television,not_removed,really i dont know much about it but i had assumed it was just a standard will arnett vehicle but if it has a lot more depth to it im going to have to check it out
television,not_removed,i havent seen either of those but now they are both on my radar i heard about them both but never really knew what they were about
television,not_removed,that sounds exactly what im looking for something where those themes arent overt but kind of hang in the air where depression is more of the setting than the plot
television,not_removed,thanks ive also been looking for a good anime to get into so two birds with one stone
television,not_removed,isnt that the one where kirsten dunst gets nude
television,not_removed,something something crushing guilt bad at relationships huge hypocrite
television,not_removed,yes i believe there is a scene with her nude
television,not_removed,you cant possibly think on ones posted this yet
television,not_removed,thats pretty ageist of you you should be ashamed
television,not_removed,you obviously havent watched the show as you said literally every episode has something about him being and older man married to a hot younger woman and its a major aspect of the show and how people react to it and such many times with your exact comment
television,not_removed,thats kind of why its called modern family the goal of the show besides being genuinely funny is to show that nontraditional marriages homosexual age gap interracial etc have the same issues and successes as traditional ones edit our president assuming youre american is a year old with a year old immigrant wife so for your sake i hope you find it less disgusting now
television,not_removed,in the very first episode people think shes his daughter also he has adult children who are close in age to his wife the age difference is the core of their jokes on the show
television,not_removed,why would it be creepy
television,not_removed,omg ageist old people can have money and can get sweet ass too
television,not_removed,since when has that stopped people getting outraged
television,not_removed,im not outraged i just find it a bit weird lol
television,not_removed,not really theres a reason why of people in society dont marry someone years younger than them
television,not_removed,haha bad example to use for less disgusting but i definitely agree with your first bit
television,not_removed,well no thats even more disgusting lol more gross
television,not_removed,you do sound a bit outraged mate but its not like slightly outraged comments discussing a show has never been posted here before or anything
television,not_removed,you felt a bit weird enough to make a whole post about it
television,not_removed,yeah but when you see a couple with that big an age gap its pretty rude to judge and say derogatory comments in many parts of the world its pretty common to have big age gaps between husband and wife south america and asia especially
television,not_removed,and there are two particular reasons why the other happen and those two reasons are the bling and the thing
television,not_removed,whats the reason because its not typical thats not a reason to do something or to not do something im sure you do some atypical shit with your life also havent you ever heard the phrase love is blind
television,not_removed,sorry if i sound outraged im really not i could care less about modern family lmao 😂 i legit just saw it on tv while i was bored and so i started watching just now and was like wtf this old dude plays her husband i thought he might be playing her dad lol i only watched like minutes
television,not_removed,this guy knows
television,not_removed,yeah if you watch a little more you will see that he is very wealthy as well and i believe that even the show acknowledges thats why they initially got together
television,not_removed,that makes sense
television,not_removed,i dont know if it follows from the fact that most modern shows make a democrat the president that hollywood sees them as the only ones rightfully suited to run the government house of cards for example has democrats in charge but hardly portrays that in a flattering light if the cast of house of cards were republicans many republicans would probably read the show as hollywood attacking them theres probably some impetus to make the main cast of most political shows democrats so you dont have to deal with some of the ramifications of making them republicans but its not like every show that puts democrats in power exists to flatter that idea
television,not_removed,i dont know reality tv in the pretty much has that covered
television,not_removed,alpha house follows republican senators but its an amazon show
television,not_removed,scandal but i think its in name only
television,not_removed,had a few seasons with republicans in charge but for a show with such an obvious right wing slant all the republicans tended to be whiny morons or traitors or traitorous whiny morons
television,not_removed,try fox
television,not_removed,got war of the bastards
television,not_removed,firefly the train job one for the books and what got a lot of people hooked on the series
television,not_removed,lost season episode awesome episode awesome ending
television,not_removed,star trek tng the drumhead very relevant for today as well
television,not_removed,silicon valleys meinertzhagen haversack just a big nope by the showrunners in the end
television,not_removed,how i met your mothercountdown episode we all knew something big was coming but none of us were prepared to s find out that marshalls dad died he was one of the nicest dads on television ever
television,not_removed,for the anime fans rezero episode hauntingly epic ending
television,not_removed,lost season episode the constant also my favorite overall episode from the series
television,not_removed,scrubs either my lunch or my screw up
television,not_removed,tohajiilee in breaking bad
television,not_removed,although no one saw it i really like selfies chandelier ending xfile peacock brothers was also amazing
television,not_removed,buffy seeing red
television,not_removed,person of interest ifthenelse
television,not_removed,bartlet for america west wing
television,not_removed,hush from buffy
television,not_removed,hold the door
television,not_removed,most episodes of breaking bad have great endings
television,not_removed,and the red wedding
television,not_removed,i liked jaynestown too
television,not_removed,cant remember if this was a season opener or finale but the constant was pretty emotionally awesome too
television,not_removed,cowboy bebop session ballad of fallen angels
television,not_removed,the ending of that episode was john cho singing wild world a capella equally beautiful of a scene might i add too bad the show had such an awful pilot and was named selfie turned out to be a gem
television,not_removed,if anybody likes this also check out soul quest overdrive basically the exact same characters except theyre sports equipment instead of fruit unfortunately there are only a few short episodes
television,not_removed,id like to see her do at least one guest appearance on samantha bees show
television,not_removed,awesome for her i thought jon shouldve given her the show
television,not_removed,shes too good for what the daily show has become
television,not_removed,she didnt want it she said several times that she didnt feel she was ready for it
television,not_removed,quality but the bird and omar court scene is mine followed quickly by mcnutty wrecking his car
television,not_removed,if youre going to go that route for a title at least dont it like were in aol kids only
television,not_removed,picking this scene as anybodys favorite scene has to be pretty cliche by now
television,not_removed,are you offended by my title bro
television,not_removed,its actually exclusively my favourite scene
television,not_removed,
television,not_removed,the other threads saying the same thing would prove you wrong
television,not_removed,i guess well never know for sure
television,not_removed,snuff box is fantasticmatty berry and rich fulcher also in the mighty boosh both star in it if you like english comedies you should check out look around you
television,not_removed,toast of london
television,not_removed,he had a show called snuff box that definitely has its moments
television,not_removed,mighty boosh isnt musical in the sense of being a musical like broadway its musical in the sense that the main characters supposedly have a band make a lot of musical references and occasionally play music for about seconds there is maybe sort of musical episode in season its more like a weird psychedelic experimental show its an acquired taste but also brilliant if you like mr show with bob and david you might like mighty boosh
television,not_removed,there is a episode of community he shows up in that i got a kick out of
television,not_removed,my aunt went to scotlandshe says its nice
television,not_removed,i love how snuff box manages to be a skit show that also tells a season long story unique and hilarious whiskey
television,not_removed,yes i can hear you clem fandango
television,not_removed,ive never heard of mr show i will take your word for it i think i can handle what they do on this show ill give it a shot thanks for the help
television,not_removed,im looking that up thanks
television,not_removed,the continuity is brilliant i wish they had come out with a second season
television,not_removed,mr show was an hbo sketch show in the that had the break out roles for david cross bob odenkirk sarah silverman jack black tom kinney scott aukerman karen kilgariff brian posehn paul f thompkins and a bunch of other people in there was an extra bit made for netflix called w bob and david
television,not_removed,really i need to check that out is it in netflix or is it on dvd i like david cross bob odinkirk is really underrated paul tompkins is really good too i dont know the rest but that doesnt matter i bet theyre good if they are with those guys
television,not_removed,if you like tompkins dive into the world of mr peanut butter while he side steps all of bojacks antics on bojack horseman
television,not_removed,ill upvote anything adventure time sad that its coming to an end
television,not_removed,love this episode so delightfully trippy
television,not_removed,sucks this is now considered a cclass show for cns schedule
television,not_removed,sit beside the breakfast table think about your troubles put yourself a cup of tea and think about the bubbles you can take your teardrops and drop them in a teacup take them down to the riverside and throw them over the side to be swept up by a current and taken to the ocean to be eaten by some fishes who were eaten by some fishes and swallowed by a whale who grew so old he decomposed he died and left his body to the bottom of the ocean now everybody knows that when a body decomposes the basic elements are given back to the ocean and the sea does what it oughta and soon theres salty water thats not too good for drinking cause it tastes just like a teardrop so they run it through a filter and it comes out from a faucet and is poured into a teapot which is just about to bubble now think about your troubles
television,not_removed,this is probably one of my least favorite episodes i honestly dont know why people like it so much this isnt nick jr﻿
television,not_removed,well its a progressive condition
television,not_removed,its a shame how characters lose these little aspects of themselves as they slip into their archetypes the longer a show goes on i cant think of many showscharacters in which this doesnt happen
television,not_removed,i remember why i always liked that show now
television,not_removed,whatever happened to the one armed guy
television,not_removed,definitely the best character right behind mr burns always enjoy episodes starring him and burns especially when we get to see grandpas past
television,not_removed,old simpsons is best simpsons
television,not_removed,herman reminds me of steve buscemi for some reason
television,not_removed,its a classic pincer movement it cant fail against a old awesome
television,not_removed,kinda the opposite of what happened with professor farnsworth
television,not_removed,these early episodes may have a little more depth or whatever but theyre nowhere near as polished and funny as the golden years
television,not_removed,i miss herman
television,not_removed,they all changed though just like the focus of the show it started out about the family then it was mostly about bart and then became mostly about homer
television,not_removed,but the simpsons havent aged
television,not_removed,httptvtropesorgpmwikipmwikiphpmainflanderization literally named for the simpsons
television,not_removed,yeah my main problem with later seasons of scrubs or community
television,not_removed,httpsimpsonswikiacomwikihermanhermann
television,not_removed,to me the entire old people doing or saying outdated things is one of the best parts of the simpsons especially mr burns and all his ancient colloquialisms
television,not_removed,seasons imo are the best with being the very best
television,not_removed,apus kids though
television,not_removed,joey on friends is another example
television,not_removed,ahoyhoy
television,not_removed,master race
television,not_removed,have they aged
television,not_removed,hell yes before i knew what flanderization was or perhaps before the term was coined i used to always point to joey as an example of this phenomenon specifically the later episode where he spells baby babi early on he was a pretty typical too cool for school undereducated but normal guy ross didnt you read the lord of the rings in high school joey no i had sex in high school by the end he was a borderline moron and everyone made jokes about him living with chandler and monica forever because he couldnt house or feed himself i think its probably due to writer turnover where incoming writers either dont understand a character or cant agree on a characters traits beyond the most obvious ones so those are the ones that get emphasized
television,not_removed,kevin on the office is my goto example of this phenomenon
television,not_removed,yeah but joey just got more entertaining and likeable as the show went on i cant believe people bring him up in this context so often his character early in the show is cliche and boring later on hes a delight and by far the best friend
television,not_removed,season is phenomenal
television,not_removed,they were born in season and then aged up to toddler status
television,not_removed,eric the older brother from boy meets world is another obvious example early on eric was the cool older brother he may not have been a genius but he seemed to be of average intelligence by the end of that show he had gone beyond just dumb they made it seem like he had brain damage or something there is nothing wrong with having an idiot character i just hate it when they make a regular character into that kramer was the crazyidiot from the beginning of seinfeld thats a big part of why his antics fit so well you expected that because that was exactly who kramer was
television,not_removed,if it aint broke
television,not_removed,wow youre cruel that whole thing read like a kick to the joeys apple
television,not_removed,mine is mark from roseanne he started out as just a too cool for school gearheadrockerstoner and devolved into a dimwit punching bag
television,not_removed,perfect
television,not_removed,oh ok cool so there wasnt another random time jump
television,not_removed,
television,not_removed,more minutes ive almost made it
television,not_removed,silly conan the blues play in st louis
television,not_removed,whatre you smoking brother and how much per gram
television,not_removed,thats a lot of words jesus christ literally all the characters were terrible most of them indeed are not fantastic peopleanimals but thats part of the point and i dont think brooker hates women
television,not_removed,of shows are crap of anything is crap
television,not_removed,what shows do you like
television,not_removed,the first few of bojack horseman arnt fantastic but decent it really picks up though you should try giving it another chance but it does get pretty depressing
television,not_removed,matt is a jerk to his friends for no good reason he makes poor decisions the show meanders but we allow it for those little inside marvel reveals
television,not_removed,i dont think he hates women in the and season of black mirror so far almost every female character is depicted at some of their worst its a bit like that for men too but not nearly to the extent of the women
television,not_removed,tips fedora melitist snob

television,not_removed,there are dozens that i like the star trek shows babylon the x files the twilight zone breaking bad supernatural deadwood the supranos rome firefly battlestar galactica the stargate shows and the list goes on thats not even counting anime
television,not_removed,thanks couldnt remember whos law it was
television,not_removed,shell have to fight john barrowman for it
television,not_removed,thats actually perfect
television,not_removed,idk im still hoping for eden sher
television,not_removed,
television,not_removed,wow what a fucking stretch the title clearly says what television show shes from and which character she plays you mustve been itching real bad to get some kind of laugh
television,not_removed,maybe he didnt know who squirrel girl is
television,not_removed,i think its because she is a new actor no one knows hell even with her characters name i was confused for a second
television,not_removed,no you do the whole who thing when the title only mentions the name at that point sure i get it but given the fact that the name and her role is mentioned along with which television show she was in him doing the whole who thing reeks of a desperate need of attention her being an actress in stranger things alone warrants this being what passes for newsworthy on reddit given how big of a deal this show is
television,not_removed,im on episode and she is basically a background character at this point but it took me like seconds to figure it out
television,not_removed,always assumed it was foreshadowing for both characters when earlier in the season tony is on the boat with bobby and he says if you get done right you probably dont hear the shot or feel the bullet tony remembered that scene in the final scene of the episode before the finale to me it went one way for bobby and the cleaner way for tony edit i guess my first first reaction was that something happened to my tv my first opinion after i figured out i got what was intended as the ending was that he died he was always going to die didnt love how they did it impressions
television,not_removed,i thought something had gone wrong with the tv at first then later i thought that it was an empty way to end such a great show and now i still feel that way but without the bitterness
television,not_removed,the best explanation i have read that it was the viewer who was getting whacked
television,not_removed,i assumed meadow opened the door and they ate dinner opinion hasnt changed since then i guess that perspective made the sudden cut feel not as shocking as most people seemed to take it
television,not_removed,i thought then and think now that there is significance to those onion rings
television,not_removed,i havent thought about the finale of the sopranos in a while i saw a taping about an hour after it aired i remember the last scene and how tensed it was and i kept wondering what was going to happen to tony and his family in the diner then the show all of sudden cut to black and for a minute i was confused i thought i made a mistake and forgot to record the last couple minutes of the show and i was pissed all in all thinking about it now i am happy with how the show ended and where the characters ended up tony will always continue to live out his life looking over his shoulders
television,not_removed,i have maintained the same assumption about the finale that i made when i first saw it that tony and his family die in that diner i remember being bitterly disappointed at first and am still a little especially compared to othet hbo finales like the wire and six feet under which tied things up whilst leaving loose threads in a satisfying way still it didnt diminish the sopranos in my eyes it had its dips in quality but at its best it was brilliant season two remains my favourite i think with richie
television,not_removed,back when it aired i had a dodgy digital tv box thing so my first reaction was to run across the room and start whacking it and screaming not now you bastard then credits started scrolling up screen turns out the ending to one of the most critically acclaimed tv shows was to simulate my sky box crashing was shit then is still shit now
television,not_removed,i love it its the perfect ending for the show
television,not_removed,interesting story about that i was at my friends parents house watching it in their living room the kitchen also had a tv and my friends mom was watching it in there my friend accidentally turned off the living room tv in the middle of the episode so we all ran into the kitchen until she turned it back on when the final scene ran and the black hit the screen we all looked at each other for a second and then made another mad dash for the kitchen we thought our friend had sat on the remote again and accidentally turned it off again but when we saw the credits we all let out a giant fuck kinda knocked the wind outta ya
television,not_removed,i watched with other people we thought the cable went out once we figured out that was intentional we werent thrilled it seemed like they wanted an ending that everyone would like after reading some theories i may agree with their conclusion and maybe that is better than i felt initially the ending is just one part for me the sopranos may not be my favorite show but this is the best highest quality tv show imo
television,not_removed,the same what a shitty ending
television,not_removed,i was sure our cable went out and was furious then the credits started to roll i felt a little jilted but not overly upset i chalked it up to the scene being from tonys perspective and the shady guy in the members only jacket shot him hence the quick cut to black years later i read an interview with the writers who said that one of the reasons for this ending came from the fact that there was no ending that would satisfy every fan something along the lines of how would seeing tonys brains splattered all over the table add anything
television,not_removed,i hated it then and i hate it now
television,not_removed,shame we missed out on the conversation about birth control between tony and meadow
television,not_removed,i called my brother because i thought my cable had shut off
television,not_removed,i find it really odd when people say the ending of the show was shit like honestly what were you expecting to happen
television,not_removed,no and im sure rthedennis would have words
television,not_removed,but heres the thing right we just spent an episode where we watched footage of him watching and editing footage so if that was the case and something theyre pushing wouldnt we see a fat dennis all the time then at the end when hes reviewing the footage of them reviewing the footage he be fat
television,not_removed,he has banged a lot of chicks
television,not_removed,i dont know man may not be that crazy
television,not_removed,it is he has that entire drawer filled with videos of him and chicks i mean they have this weird angle but he still has them and fat guys dont get that just look at when mac was fat all he did was eat chimichangas
television,not_removed,its also one of the most likely shows to get cancelled
television,not_removed,hopefully not i think that a lot of the negative reviews have to do with people expecting it to be more like scandal and thats not what it is it has some of the elements but it feels more like bones or even castle all good shows
television,not_removed,regardless of the reviews its the lowest rated new show on tv
television,not_removed,pitch is lower but i think the negative spin on the ratings is a bit exaggerated at this point by the numbers its not that far off from other shows inaround its time slot but well see how it plays out
television,not_removed,ratings arent judged based on other shows in the timeslot but vs the network average also new shows have higher premiere expectations because they tend to drop harder throughout the season notorious is the lowest rated new abc show and the sixth lowest current abc show above secrets and lies quantico last man standing dr ken and agents of shield that appears fine but it really isnt last man standing and dr ken are both friday shows so its not an apt comparison agents of shield has a strong fanbase so it will hold consistently throughout the season which cannot yet be said of notorious that means that by midseason itll be one of the bottom shows on abc keep in mind that notorious is a replacement for scandal one of their strongest performers its also sandwiched in on what is their strongest night or was wednesday does better now it has the best leadin and followup possible given ratings and content really a premiere is somewhat of a travesty pitch got the same ratings however they literally gave it the worst possible leadin with no followup fox has lower scripted averages and its incredibly offbrand for fox plus its been generating more positive feedback so it should show smaller weekoverweek drops barring terrible starts from conviction timeless or american housewife in the next few weeks or bad dropoffs for the terribly received macgyver notorious is the frontrunner for the first cancelled show of the season
television,not_removed,thanks for the info i dont know how good pitch is since i havent watched it yet but it looks good and i intend to check it out i just made the statement based on the numbers i saw which had pitch slightly lower what you said is true though about new shows overall that theres a higher standard notorious was in the slot with million viewers overall the info i saw had pitch at and in comparison but there are cases where shows that appear to be failing on some level get renewed and go on to have more seasons that said promos from abc are calling notorious thursday nights new show i understand what youre saying and it is a numbers game even when there are other factors im not saying im right im not saying youre wrong well see i know im enjoying it and have my fingers crossed for it to do well
television,not_removed,the source i follow tv grim reaper had notorious at but its a small difference overall also the number new thursday show thing is a blatant lie the good place on nbc fantastic show might be my favorite new show got a upon its move to thursday it did premiere on a monday so if looking at it just from a shows to premiere on thursday perspective notorious is the number new thursday show but that would hardly be an achievement considering the only other new thursday show was pitch for the best unbiased raw info on how well tv shows are doing as well as renewal and cancellation predictions i advise checking out tv grim reaper he has a website wwwtvgrimreapercom as well as a twitter page tvgrimreaper always tells it how it is currently he has rosewood pitch and notorious likely for cancellation but he suggested that agents of shield and scream queens will fall under likely for cancellation on next weeks update
television,not_removed,thanks ill definitely check that out good convo
television,not_removed,every years or so we get to watch ned starks tragedy renewed youre a sick man
television,not_removed,eh i would rather they just do spinoffs you can do tons with all the material created for that world roberts rebellion the greyjoy rebellion war of the ninepenny kings etc you can even do a few seasons about the original war again the others
television,not_removed,gottng
television,not_removed,in the name of the greatest people that have ever trod this earth i draw the line in the dust and toss the gauntlet before the feet of tyranny and i say reboots now reboots tomorrow reboots forever
television,not_removed,this is sarcasm right
television,not_removed,there isnt much of a point in redoing the show unless there were some big factors holding the original back like budget or graphic effects neither were an issue here tho and the show is good all around it would make more sense to reboot stuff from the or or something that was on regular cable but redone with more mature content i would prefer a prequel or spinoffs
television,not_removed,sounds like a pretty terrible idea to be honest
television,not_removed,why do you think that would be a good idea what is missing that you would want another whole series telling the same story spinoffs could actually work really well for the gotasoiaf universe the world is soo rich with other stories to tell such as dunk and egg the blackfyre rebellions roberts rebellion aegons conquest and the og long night just to name a few not that id necessarily want to see all of those but there are plenty of shows to mine from a song of ice and fire if thats what hbo wants

television,not_removed,who are these people with so much time on their hands that they can make supercuts on stuff like this up next a supercut of people cutting celery
television,not_removed,i was thinking fish recently
television,not_removed,considering that after seasons they are still doing a lot of backstory for the characters i think you may get an answer one day
television,not_removed,i just always figured it was a riff on sweet tea some sort of nickname that stuck early on in life sort of thing
television,not_removed,shes named after one of robs friends girlfriend
television,not_removed,apt username
television,not_removed,oh man these guys are so black at heart i loved this episode the jokes and subtle nods towards the tv industry are just hilarious the dodgy acting etc but the end i just did not see coming and it was awful man you guys are sick
television,not_removed,hands down my favourite show of the festive season find any way you can to watch the other episodes
television,not_removed,thats what made me want to put it out i felt a little uneasy as the episode unfolded but it multiplied in the last bit the ending really does it but its so hard to discuss without spoilers
television,not_removed,no you can watch it in any order theyre not in a particular sequence youll definitely like it though
television,not_removed,if youre in the uk or not in the uk and have a proxy then there is or this site its probably on a number of streaming sites
television,not_removed,between brooklyn ninenine the mick and the last man on earth fox has been killing it in the comedy game lately im optimistic about this
television,not_removed,read the title thinking the shows were called new girl and modern family and someone just hadnt told them they were already shows
television,not_removed,i love younger its so entertaining discovered wrecked a few days ago while clicking through channels i could not stop laughing when they burned the other passengers
television,not_removed,i think wrecked is hilarious
television,not_removed,younger is fantastic its my comfort food show im really enjoying sweetvicious so far its a really fun superhero jaunt essentially as i think someone put it unreal a unreal f
television,not_removed,watched the magicians its pretty awesome
television,not_removed,watching sweet vicious and its handling its subject matter better than i expected instead of being a all men are dogs it transcends above gender bias the things thats bothering me is the romance scenes which are cringey the characters of ophelia and jules are interesting the show is exploring ophelia more but she has become every nerd cliché ever i am hoping they explore jules a little bit and put ophelia in a sort of background i dont want them to go towards the arrow route and make ophelia anther felicity it would be interesting to see more of jules
television,not_removed,the magicians is awesome i cant wait for season unreal was good in the first season but season left me kinda iffy
television,not_removed,i loved the magicians raving about it i thought wrecked was fucking hilarious ridiculous crazy off the wall insane funny shit apparently lots of reddit disagrees with me as i got torn to shreds when i tried to spread the love
television,not_removed,i have been watching people of earth and found it amusing
television,not_removed,none of them wrecked sucked could not stand the fat guy with the heavy beard who they made stupid search party was really good already watched it twice
television,not_removed,i enjoy they take themsleves so seriously
television,not_removed,i actually watched by mistake and ended up loving it great writing and everyone on it has epic timing
television,not_removed,the romance is cringy olicity never again
television,not_removed,i like wrecked it is a parody on lost lost i love
television,not_removed,then the oscars grinded to a halt but it wasnt warren beattys fault something something burt ward
television,not_removed,no shit he clearly knows somethings wrong faye fucked up not him
television,not_removed,how did she fuck up and not him he gave it to her to read he just passed the problem off he couldve said theres something wrong but he handed her the card now im not big on placing blame anyway but i cant wrap my head around thinking she fucked up and he didnt when its pretty clear they both handled it wrong
television,not_removed,i think he was showing the card to her and she just saw la la land and read it off because she thought he was being cute its really neither of their faults
television,not_removed,i think you are watching banshee buddy
television,not_removed,having watched it def not on par with daredevil writing is all over the place watching from bed sometimes hard not to fall asleep fight scenes about as sharp as a wet towel
television,not_removed,the performances in this show were great but you could see they were struggling with some of the garbage they were given to work with
television,not_removed,i like the show but its not amazing and definitively not on par with daredevil its average and disappointing as it could be way better no dragon punching
television,not_removed,first of all iron fist so far is amazing really i found it boring stupid and so hard to watch if youve been holding off on watching due to reviews dont youre missing out no they really arent this show is terrible to me its on par with daredevil absolutely not
television,not_removed,i have to agree i kept waiting for it to get better and it was a train wreck the writing is awful and its just so boring
television,not_removed,i guess each person has their own opinion but for me its been better so far if the only thing you are watching for is the fight scenes then i understand but i dont need super matrix level fight scenes to enjoy this i like the way danny is developing all his relationships with the characters and the meachums have been great to watch too the characters of daredevil were boring to me at times fisk i was never even scared of with the hand theres a lot of mystery you feel like you never really know whats going to happen
television,not_removed,can i ask whats awful in particular about the writing
television,not_removed,the only compelling character is ward and you want it to be revenge porn against this douchey guy but then hes just a junky with a daddy complex
television,not_removed,the dialog felt really clunky and forced
television,not_removed,mmm okay i dont agree but i respect that though i never noticed the dialogue as a problem maybe danny sounds cheesy at times but i think anytime youre dealing with kungfu heroes theres going to be some amount of cheesiness i never read the original comics so i dont know how well danny matches up to the character though
television,not_removed,for sure to each his own i just found it all so soap operay and boring but thats just my opinion what do i know i never read the comics either so i have no frame of reference of what hes supposed to be i have high hopes for the defenders though should be good
television,not_removed,itll be pretty damn hard to top planet earth

television,not_removed,i wish i didnt know about this now im sad that its so far away
television,not_removed,its from the makers of planet earth so i guess after weve seen the beauty of planet earth in a couple of years well have another treat almost as spectacular
television,not_removed,theyve got a flash too

television,not_removed,didnt howard stern have literally the exact same thing years ago the haters actually listened more than the fans but its not about hate or like controversy gets viewership not good not bad not real or fake anything controversial gets attention no matter the entertainment medium be it blogs tv radio or your school news paper controversy is the key this has literally been proven documented and written about since the yellow journalism of the
television,not_removed,of course we do watching worse people fail makes people feel much better than watching better people succeed
television,not_removed,or maybe were just more likely to watch shows that are really good
television,not_removed,how else do you explain rush limbaugh nancy pelosi hillary clinton and that one kid king from game of thrones
television,not_removed,it is amazing to me that this is not obvious we have to have characters to root against
television,not_removed,i wish this was the case with fear the walking dead i truly dislike almost all the characters on that show epically after they let that dog get killed fuck those people i dont care about them enough to keep watching that show
television,not_removed,private parts said that they did a rating analysis of his show people who liked stern listened to about half of his show people who didnt really care about him listened to about minutes while those that hated stern listened to his entire show every day
television,not_removed,big fan of what youre doing in genetic science by the way
television,not_removed,theres a difference between shows we hate watch and shows that are excellent with wellcrafted villains that we love to hate though right
television,not_removed,i really wanted to like that show but i found it as stupefyingly dull as the walking dead with the added problem of there being zero characters i actually care about now that youve told me about the dog ill never watch it again thanks seriously i love dogs
television,not_removed,i just do palindromes that hold them together but thanks
television,not_removed,oh yeah the last of my examples would be the wellcrafted and excellent acting type the other i just cant stop watchinglistening because they just fucking annoy me to the bone
television,not_removed,i admire your resilience i cant listen to people who irritate me that deeply nancy grace for example i involuntarily shudder even typing her name
television,not_removed,best episode by far and i knew it felt almost too good to be true
television,not_removed,after hearing all the backlash with zach after the end of last season the writers must have been cackling with this one
television,not_removed,this goddamned kid character though ive never been so infuriated in my life about one tv show character but this kid manages to make me hate him so much
television,not_removed,i guess they realised how much everybody hated zach so they said fuck it and decided to make him the true villain of this season holy shit that was aggravating
television,not_removed,that fuckin kid
television,not_removed,im glad that they pared this season down to ten episodes and will wrap it up next season its really a great solid horroractionschlock mix that i love
television,not_removed,fuck zach
television,not_removed,that kid is a dumbass nukes a city because his zombiemom tried to kill the dad oh and of course the master escapes didnt see that coming a mile away
television,not_removed,the kid is still alive goddamn hes the reason why i quit early in season one he needs to be killed
television,not_removed,they are going full metro
television,not_removed,seriously though fuck zach
television,not_removed,i think the only character ive hated more in all of fiction is dolores umbridge
television,not_removed,fuck zach
television,not_removed,to be fair it has been fun to witness
television,not_removed,to be fair to john i dont really think anyone expected the rest of the republicans to fold like they did
television,not_removed,thanks oliver
television,not_removed,not only does he sound like cameron he acts like him as well apparently﻿
television,not_removed,jon stewart was begging for trump to run and when he does jon retired all those jokes are wasted somewhere in the abyss
television,not_removed,how long ago was this taped i wonder if john even remembers doing this﻿
television,not_removed,regulated hahahahaha
television,not_removed,holy jesus that was brilliant cant wait to show it to my coworker
television,not_removed,why trump wont win we have eight days to go and nothing is going to stop hillary ill just use trumps own words but just pretend hillary said them i could stand in the middle of avenue and shoot somebody and i wouldnt lose voters
television,not_removed,he said this and then tried to act like he was above trumps candidacy until he basically had the nomination what a stupid coward
television,not_removed,did he write that check or did he lie about that
television,not_removed,oliver is unwatchable havent been able to stomach his nonesense this election cycle complete bias and irresponsible journalism while simultaneously calling his audience or half the populus morons for paying more attention than he is i wish he promised to leave tv if trump wins
television,not_removed,at least it gave him enough material for like shows so maybe he should thank the donald
television,not_removed,its current year
television,not_removed,i cannot wait till november because whoever wins or loses it is going to be epic especially if you enjoyed karl rove getting humiliated in or democrats depression of this election has been more interesting than even the clusterfuck that was people think the world ends if their team loses or problems disappear the moment their team wins only a full scale nuclear war can end the world and solve of human problems it rests on our collective delusion that our leaders have self control and are wise enough not to deploy that option
television,not_removed,only because hillary is a legit bad candidate if there was a legit option hilary would lose for sure
television,not_removed,it was fun until people started actually supporting him then it turned into a real bummer
television,not_removed,it really is fascinating how most people didnt take trump seriously now here we are scared and wondering what is going to happen if he wins
television,not_removed,its been fun the way watching a train wreck is fun at first its horrible but thrilling and for a moment you dont think about the human suffering and you just hear the awesome explosion and the groan of metal and you cant stop yourself from staring but this election has been like watching that and then someone just clock oranges you into watching the whole thing the train wreck and then the resultant screaming as badly injured people try to escape and the horrible stench of the burning metal filling your nostrils and all you want is for it to be over but it wont ever be over not ever
television,not_removed,it was fun until he started speaking
television,not_removed,you think thats fun wait until the impeachment proceedings of hrc start did you really think this was going to end on nov
television,not_removed,sometime during mid june to august it was during the time when jon was directing rosewater
television,not_removed,it was like years ago not that long
television,not_removed,hahahahaha its going to be fun to watch the mass triggerings of the hillary camp as she loses either hillary loses big time or she becomes the first female president in history to be arrested indicted and shortly impeached in the month transitional period between nov and her supposed to be taking office thats unique no ones ever done that before
television,not_removed,i thought he treated trump running for president like comedy gold
television,not_removed,he said this years ago as a joke how is he being a coward
television,not_removed,coward
television,not_removed,tis called a joke
television,not_removed,wait comedians have to be unbiased to avoid shattering your fragile egos now
television,not_removed,this joke was barely funny the first time you people repeat jokes more than oliver does
television,not_removed,oh fuck yeah if hillary wins i am taking my beach chair a cooler of beer and hanging in rthedonald that place is gonna go wild rsubredditdrama might be a fun place too if trump wins i am just turning on cnn and msnbc edit if trump wins i think rthedonald users are gonna create havok all over reddit
television,not_removed,legit
television,not_removed,sanders was legit but camp clinton and the rest of the dnc cheated so yeah great idea folks
television,not_removed,most people didnt take trump seriously now here we are wondering what is going to happen if he wins if most people didnt take trump seriously we wouldnt be in this situation the consensus on reddit doesnt necessarily represent the political views of the entire united states
television,not_removed,wondering what is going to happen if he wins hopefully hell have an aneurysm
television,not_removed,httpiimgurcomtotiwcojpg
television,not_removed,i guess i should start learning russian in case he wins
television,not_removed,ah this was around carlos danger
television,not_removed,ill be grabbing my popcorn for any meltdown on election day
television,not_removed,i hope you realize nothing at all is going to happen to hillary whether she wins or loses hint shes going to win no question
television,not_removed,hahaha theyre both pieces of shit its fucking hilarious what shit spot our country is in hahaha hahaha edit you know what no one else has ever done when running for president talk about using nuclear weapons against other countries talk about torturing people hell talk about the size of their dick i mean the list goes on and on on both fucking sides just keep laughing it up
television,not_removed,trump did try to sue bill maher over a joke offer to write a check
television,not_removed,hahahai have insulted a television god for calling him outbring the downvotes a god will push on the infidel
television,not_removed,no but a programme that prides itself on being better than the news should at least be able to back that claim up and its an ego thing that i or many others dont like being called an idiot for simply not sharing the same opinion as someone else who is misinformed and bias
television,not_removed,there are a lot of republican establishment folks who would love to see hillary win because shell be so mired in scandal from day shell never be able to do anything unless she has some rally around the president no matter what moment
television,not_removed,edit if trump wins i think rthedonald users are gonna create havok all over reddit they already are ive been on this site for years and ive never seen more blatant bigotry on this site outside of certain subreddits more than before
television,not_removed,i dont like the subreddit but im suscribing because you bet theyre going to go private after trumps loss
television,not_removed,
television,not_removed,bernie is a great guy with a lot of heart and deeprooted principles unfortunately he really isnt a viable candidate for exactly the same reason parts of the left love him so much economic populism bernie is great but hes also a selfdescribed socialist whose policies dont pass any kind of mathematical scrutiny it sucks but the truth often does
television,not_removed,why were you downvoted he is literally in the position hes in because the other candidates had no traction and people detest hillary
television,not_removed,if most people didnt take trump seriously we wouldnt be in this situation how many people even bother to vote in primaries and of those how many voted for the dozens of other candidates the fact that hes getting at least of the vote now is simply just another example of why the party system is bad and why is a horrible voting system
television,not_removed,well said maybe most is the wrong word i gotta stop generalizing perhaps a lot is a better voice of words
television,not_removed,funny if the soviet union won the cold war this way the really really long con
television,not_removed,yes
television,not_removed,httpsredditcomrthemeltdown
television,not_removed,me too plus xv comes out at the end of the month good times
television,not_removed,yeah its hilarious maybe this will reform your country for the better tabula rasa and all that jazz trump is much less likely to go to nuclear war with russia than hillary no fly zone clinton
television,not_removed,in your defense i thought you where just stupid not calling him out p
television,not_removed,hes a comedian not a journalist and he never pretends otherwise
television,not_removed,wait so a comedian called you an idiot and rather than reevaluate your position youre doubling down
television,not_removed,if trump where to win i think he is going to extract payback from a lot of people that guy has got to be keeping a list nixon kept a list as far as hillary is concerned i am not sure of what her gameplan is i mean i know the public gameplan but she has a public and private persona
television,not_removed,bigotry how are you making the connection back to rthedonald
television,not_removed,bernie is great but hes also a selfdescribed socialist whose policies dont pass any kind of mathematical scrutiny you are wrong at best at worst youre actively spreading disinformation
television,not_removed,why doesnt socialism work in the us when it works in most of europe
television,not_removed,oh no has anyone actually seen and verified trumps birth certificate are we sure he isnt actually putins older brother sent here as a baby
television,not_removed,a no fly zone thats not quite true is it an agreed upon no fly zone we arent going to fight russia lets be real if we do though im sure youll have your musket ready
television,not_removed,i mean youre probably not wrong
television,not_removed,i have sinned
television,not_removed,and its a bullshit line of defense im a comedian not a journalist proceeds to do two back to back minute segments disecting a political position he disagrees with the problem with the im a comedian thing is he and to a lesser extent stewart use it to excuse away using bad or misleading facts when someone bites back that their logic is flawed or their facts are misleading they just fall back on uh comedy show
television,not_removed,his entire show is literally pretend journalism by being a comedian claiming to not be a journalist while reporting and interviewing on current event issues wow i guess you are right howd i get so confused
television,not_removed,what a cop out excuse and alex jones is just a humble water filter salesman
television,not_removed,im waiting for you to clarify what your talking about are you asking me to reevaluate my position because jon oliver told me to not pay attention to hillary clintons scandals because he told me everything was ok and then the fbi reopened the investigate days before the election
television,not_removed,dude you should check the emails filled with team clinton talking about getting shows canceled and tv hosts suspended for running stories that were negative of clinton theres emails about team clinton getting friendly congresspeople to ask for gowdys and chaffetz resignation from the committee investigating clinton for investigating her too hard whole clinton modus operandi is to destroy shame or silence anyone who is not totally on her team look what happened to comey guy chooses not to forward it up for prosecution even though he says she clearly did something wrong but no one could prove intent hillary loves him he reopens the investigation and look at the shitstorm she unleashes on him she insists the investigation isnt reopened she has people demand his resignation she has people assert that he broke the law by doing his job shes a monster and anyone who thinks thats ok because shes our monster is deluded shes only fighting for herself and no one else and it doesnt matter what youve done for her if you do one thing that hurts her youre finished unless you have a life insurance folder with her emails backed up
television,not_removed,america isnt europe there are countless arguments foragainst socialism in and out of the us but it really boils down to one thing americans havent chosen socialism we prefer regulated capitalism and we are allowed to run our country however we choose
television,not_removed,now that you suggest it the last name drumpf does have a slight russian twist to it are we sure the donalds grandparents were german immigrants
television,not_removed,interesting how the left hallucinates when the facts show as general dunford testified before congress that a no fly zone means boots on the ground to enforce russia wont take that lightly just because its obfuscated by the term no fly zone doesnt mean its not a declaration of war it should be renamed air superiority zone backed up by land control to keep air superiority but it doesnt roll off the tongue as well nor does it hide the war declaration inside of it as well as no fly zone does agreed upon is also a suitably sanitising term as well why would syr agree to lose air sovereignty over its own country would the states ever do that
television,not_removed,hes under no obligation to provide you with facts he uses political situations and his opinion of them as a segue into jokes you are not meant to take what he says as gospel it could be completely false if he has a political goal with his show its to get people to actually do some research and think for themselves that so many people do not is not a reflection on oliver but rather on those people
television,not_removed,theyre pundits who hide under the comedian banner but lets be honest here john oliver is like a liberal rush limbaugh or glenn beck he says what you want to hear to reaffirm your views plus some comedy thrown in
television,not_removed,since hes never said that hes better than the news that you are an idiot to not pay attention to clintons scandal not scandals plural that everything was okay i can only assume that youre a schizophrenic and are hearing voices therefore youre most likely a trump supporter or a republican heres what you are saying im not feeling good about what im hearing so im offended
television,not_removed,countless arguments but you cant actually name one europe has regulated capitalism as well and it works just the same just with more public provisions and workers rights
television,not_removed,the real questionwhat part of germany did they immigrate from west or east show us your ancestrycom account drumpf
television,not_removed,you seem very confused im not a fan on either ive always played devils advocate im just allergic to bullshit no one is going to start a war with russia and russia isnt going to start a war with us take off the tin foil like i said before the no fly zone would be negotiated between the us and russia httpwwwsnopescomjcschairmanresignationspeech
television,not_removed,interesting how the left hallucinates when the facts show as general dunford testified before congress that a no fly zone means boots on the ground to enforce im calling bullshit unless you can cite this
television,not_removed,hes under no obligation to provide you with facts since when without facts hes liable to a slew of lawsuits and blows to his credibility
television,not_removed,that hes better than the news he doesnt routinely call out the news for not doing their job while reporting on the stories he says they should be is that too much of a stretch to validate that statement that you are an idiot watch the first ten minutes every week for the last three weeks where he calls all trump supporters idiots or stupid or any other profanity laced attack to not pay attention to clintons scandal not scandals plural that everything was okay here you go
television,not_removed,im not sure snopes is qualified to speak on foreign policy especially given i never said the general resigned or retired only that he said what he said boots on the ground to enforce no fly and that it would agitate and bring a war with russia and whats worse than a leftist a self cuckolding leftist own your bullshit fam
television,not_removed,nah this dickhole is kind of right and your link is totally irrelevant your allergy is more of a made up gluten intolerance
television,not_removed,item cannot be found watch the video you mong
television,not_removed,he cant slander anyone but hes free to say whatever he wants and then defend himself with oh its a joke because hes a comedian hosting a comedy not a news program now oliver tries to be as accurate as possible because he has integrity but he is under no obligation whatsoever to do so
television,not_removed,is that too much of a stretch to validate that statement yes far too much of a stretch hes a comedian watch the first ten minutes every week for the last three weeks where he calls all trump supporters idiots or stupid or any other profanity laced attack give us an example here you go timestamp please
television,not_removed,im looking at the transcript right now reddit clipped the link off for whatever reason its not my job to cite anyway its your bullshit cite it
television,not_removed,not only does his show have a stake in the flow of the presidential race but he also serves as a proponent to a lot of temporal shifts and political narratives in our society if this wasnt enough hes in a very particular sub genre where he has to compete with every selfrespecting satire newsman from trevor noah to bill maher and it just so happens to be that john oliver is the most outspoken of them all hes not being factual and honest because he has integrity hes being factual and honest because its his job people dont watch his show because they think hes funny they watch his show for substance and discussion hell when the weekend update anchors are providing good talking points opinions and substance weekinweekout you better up the ante john oliver is just another satirist who ill never be able to take seriously but alas hes a cheeky british lad with an american bravado and an emmy to show for it so fuck my opinion
television,not_removed,either you are not a regular viewer and are trolling me or this conversation will never be constructive because you are not at least willing to engage im all for the discussion and i enjoy a bit of a spar for a debate its all in good fun as far as im concerned however you stepped into my comment and now seem to be lost in the point you were trying to make i provided you an example if you watch the show dedicatedly as i do then you would know full well that he consistently expresseses his discontent for anyone who supports dt and that he calls out the media in such a way to say hey im doing your job regardless of the fact he may distance himself from being defined as a journalist he sits at a news desk reading news i understand hes a comedian i dont believe the two things have to be mutually exclusive or that they are for that matter simply because he suggests it if thats something you suggest as your point then would you consider that perhaps its muddy when portraying a news show delivering actual news and being lauded by his peers for being informative and doing the job that news programs should that this does not at least lead itself some creedance to my argument if not thats cool and either way its been fun and hope you have a great day
television,not_removed,its not your job to be a mong but you do it so well
television,not_removed,hes not being factual and honest because he has integrity hes being factual and honest because its his job people dont watch his show because they think hes funny they watch his show for substance and discussion no it is not his job his job is to make people laugh his job is to be a comedian hes best at doing that with political content so thats what he uses it serves as a way to get to his jokes his job is not to tell news if people go to him for news then thats their problem if people believe him of the time then thats because they entirely missed the point he is not a journalist and he is not trying to teach his audience everything about a subject hes trying to make them laugh and because hes a decent guy he tries to inform them a little too john oliver is just another satirist who ill never be able to take seriously that is the point youre not supposed to take him seriously youre supposed to laugh if you dont like his show fine dont watch him thats not something you say about a news program thats not something you say about journalism thats something you say about a show thats not supposed to be taken seriously
television,not_removed,i provided you an example so far in the episode that you cite hes very critical of clinton exactly the opposite of your claim that he thinks its okay have a great day i hope you and your ilk find the selfaffirmation you desperately need outside of politics
television,not_removed,yet another well crafted well reasoned piece of rhetoric from trump supporters you guys are really raising the bar for political dialogue in this country to think we could have been calling each other names instead of debating this whole time
television,not_removed,no shit
television,not_removed,httpwwwmakinggameofthronescomproductiondiarygotconnectionsnedpromisetowerofjoyinfographic makinggameofthronescom
television,not_removed,they had to do it because a lot of the casual fans of the show were apparently confused
television,not_removed,can this be trusted after all it says ned killed arthur which we know howland killed him
television,not_removed,david and dan were idiots when they decided not to have bran visit the tourney of harrenhal and with that put a great face on rhaegar targaryen
television,not_removed,a lot of people were thinking the father could have been aerys
television,not_removed,im glad theyre clearing it up i thought it was perfectly clear but i know a lot about this universe and was expecting the reveal i know quite a few causal viewers who were still clinging to the lie that jon snow is neds bastard son so they actually thought jon was an incest baby
television,not_removed,this doesnt surprise me i swear some people need a narrator this is lyanna stark she is in a relationship with rhaegar targaryen rhaegar targaryen was heir to the throne and is daenerys brother ned did not fuck his sister robert did not fuck lyanna stark
television,not_removed,my wife has encountered these people so far we have got a ned had sex with his sister and a robert baratheon is jon snows dad hopefully this graph will help a few people out
television,not_removed,it says both ned and howland killed arthur dayne so id say its good
television,not_removed,dayne was still alive until ned put him out of his misery dayne wouldve had to bleed out from the neck wound from reed for reed to have got the kill
television,not_removed,watch again ned struck the final blow
television,not_removed,i have a feeling we will get something like that next season probably will get his real name as well and any other details about lrs relationship
television,not_removed,really im more a fan of the books than the show is it not established that lyanna went off with rhaegar in the show aerys was in kings landing and lyanna was hidden away in dorne by rhaegar
television,not_removed,i hate to sound like a douche but those who only watch the show should really defer to the knowledge of those that have read the books
television,not_removed,considering the graph looks like a giant ball of yarn i doubt it
television,not_removed,is it not established that lyanna went off with rhaegar in the show it is its mentioned in i believe the first episode of the series when robert and ned visit lyannas grave in the crypts under winterfell its also mentioned when robert and ned are arguing over having daenerys assassinated
television,not_removed,i think it was people trying to read more into things than was there the fact that in the show they didnt say it was rhaegar but instead had her whisper something unintelligible made people think they show was going to pull another twist on all the people who just assumes rlj was true im not sure the mechanics of it but the aerys theory was discussed a fair amount on the got and asoiaf subs recently
television,not_removed,really im more a fan of the books than the show is it not established that lyanna went off with rhaegar in the show aerys was in kings landing and lyanna was hidden away in dorne by rhaegar the reveal of this was broken up into two episodes one scene in and one follow up scene in it is stated that rhaegar wanted his kings guard protecting the tower of joy in episode fast forward to episode and that is when we see lyanna and jon since there was a long break between these scenes casual viewers may have forgotten that rhaegar wanted her there in the first place that is most likely where the confusion is coming from
television,not_removed,on this specifically im in the same camp as you people give the show runners crap for spoon feeding and not being as subtle as the books but then they go and give us a scene that is subtle and requires some thinking and people start completely misinterpreting it theyre in a real lose lose situation here
television,not_removed,thanks i think the show shouldve reinforced it this season as well maybe a lot of the people who watch the show dont seem to have the greatest grasp of what is going on i face palm everytime i see some calling dany khaleesi my friends sister actually called her daughter khaleesi i was like you know her name is daenerys right daenerys targaryen he was like errrrrr what
television,not_removed,right but does the average viewer remember that i dont think they have done the best job establishing rhaegar on the show
television,not_removed,fair enough im not a member of those subs ive just always taken it for granted that its rlj probably my fault for being too sure of that plot so is the theory that aerys raped her or something and wherewhen
television,not_removed,yeah i remember saying to my gf they shouldve reinforced the situation this episode weeks is a long time to remember one line for casual fans i dont mean that sarcastically btw
television,not_removed,i agree dont get me wrong theres a lot about the show that literally hurts me because of how different it is in the books and it took me a long time to accept the show is different but when i see people on twitter constantly calling dany khaleesi i think its probably for the best these people cant handle complicated given shes constantly called stormborn i doubt they know shes even a targaryen or even know what a targaryen is
television,not_removed,i agree with this completely my gf and i were watching it and we wondered whether many people watching will understand the real relevance of this
television,not_removed,here is one thread on the theory most people didnt buy it but if anything is open to interpretation at all on got then somebody will come up with a new theory
television,not_removed,given shes constantly called stormborn i doubt they know shes even a targaryen or even know what a targaryen is i generally agree with you but i think thats a little much the targaryens as a whole are referred to all the time in the show at the very least casual show watchers can handle family names they just seem to be really bad with individual names and where places are it was just a problem recently since the most of the time theyre referenced is through their family as a whole and through dany directly the fact that rhaegar and lyanna possibly being a couple was only really brought up like times in a span of hours of television is the problem here i typed this reply out quick on a work break it might not be coherent
television,not_removed,the problem with that theory is the headed dragon equalling remaining targaryens in the books there are targaryens remaining already daenerys jon and young griff aegon targaryen
television,not_removed,yeah im definitely dropping arrow im not one to drop a show even if it does get to the cringe levels arrow is currently on but to fall so high like it did is just too much for me its even worse when watching the flash and seeing that the creative team is capable of making a great show but then i remember guggenheim isnt involved go figure
television,not_removed,i dropped arrow when felicity got out of her wheelchair to walk out on ollie not only was that fucking ridiculous the fact that she was so easily cured undermined the point of the whole thing and her reasoning was just terrible i think i might give season a shot tho because season got such negative reception that im curious to see if they listened to it and changed some things or if they just dig their heels in further
television,not_removed,fear the walking dead my fucking god ive never seen a show with more dull childish idiotic indecisive characters in my entire life i loathe every single one of them i got to the part where the teenage girl lured some maniacs to their boat and just gave up there
television,not_removed,tyrant that show gets way less believable with every episode a lot of plot points dont make any sense at all and i dont know what these writers are smoking when they write some of this dialogue
television,not_removed,american horror story i loved season and but and have been a bit of a slog to get through and its basically all the same so im gonna stop unless it gets insane reviews
television,not_removed,person of interest wait theyre not on this season cries in a corner
television,not_removed,ive dropped fear the walking dead i cant handle shows about abject hopelessness and misery and keep up with politics
television,not_removed,the walking dead first time im consciously dropping a show i guess ill watch the first episode to check if they blow my mind over that cliffhanger i doubt it
television,not_removed,suits this season has been a pile of shit
television,not_removed,ballers by the second ep of this season i could not remember why or how i started watching this show i really dont care about any of the characters
television,not_removed,probably fear the walking dead and possibly modern family ftwd just hasnt managed to grab me and mf has dropped in quality to me
television,not_removed,i for the most part liked of the man in the high castle but it was a show that was held up by its premiseworld and supporting cast alone if the season of the show continues the unbelievably slow pace and focus on the bland leads like it did in the first season i dont think ill continue on for a
television,not_removed,empire i really liked the first season but the second one was all over the place plus i lost count of how many times cookie says i want my familycompany back
television,not_removed,im finding myself less interested in new girl as time goes on ill give the new season a go when it comes out but if isnt great ill find it hard to ever come back
television,not_removed,the strain i had to force myself to finish last season the premiere of this season did nothing for me
television,not_removed,this is probably going to be unpopular but i think im going to drop mr robot i loved all of the mysteries in the first season but now that the mystery is gone and the show is largely just about elliots mental issues and his sisters plots i find it super boring
television,not_removed,modern family the witty writing in first seasons is gone
television,not_removed,i feel bad but probably agents of shield i loved it from the get go even the first half of season one which most people seem to dislike but ever since s skye became daisy and they intorduced the inhumans ive just been feeling frustrated with the show i still love a lot of the characters but my spyfi drama has turned into a bit of a soap opera with spies
television,not_removed,fear the walking dead ill keep up with the walking dead because it has decent writing but ftwds is atrocious
television,not_removed,ray donovan and probably mr robot i gave up mr robot after episodes liked the season but i dont know exactly i dont feel like watching it anymore ray donovan couldnt get past episode of this season last season was dull and the episode showed even this season would be the same thinking of dropping arrow ugh its more like the plot is being spun around felicity and starting to hate it also suits after the current season the shows completely ruined
television,not_removed,kinda invested in zoo but i think maybe i am done and containment
television,not_removed,how to get away with murder im not into the style anymore its too campy and last season left me feeling very unsatisfied
television,not_removed,the last man on earth was fun absurd and adventurous is boring af just sitting around the house bickering when there is literally an entire empty world to explore until the gas dries up
television,not_removed,out of disinterest outlander fear the walking dead and killjoys
television,not_removed,im pretty sure this is an unpopular opinion but im done with youre the worst im fine with shows having unlikable characters eg its always sunny in philadelphia but something about gretchen and jimmy makes me not interested in what happens to them the supporting characters on the show are pretty weak and onenote too the show seems content to have the same conflicts and misanthropic conversations over and over and what was originally perceived as edgy is now just getting repetitive and boring to me
television,not_removed,vikings way too much fillergeneral nonsense since they stretched it from a episode season to a episode season
television,not_removed,i dropped arrow when they killed laurel and went ahead dropped legends of tomorrow as well arrow had been going down hill for a few seasons the felicity situation was ruining the show laurel dying was the final straw legends never really grabbed my attention i also gave up on the last man on earth and brooklyn around the same time i was current with both at the time after parks and rec ended these seemed to be the up and coming comedies neither are all that funny i found that i hardly ever laughed after binge watching unreal i probably wont come back for the third season season was just a convoluted mess
television,not_removed,supernatural i just cant anymore
television,not_removed,ill probably drop madame secretary and quantico after the premiere just to see how bad the story is going to be
television,not_removed,empire and probably the walking dead as well
television,not_removed,arrow aswell other than that im staying i droped lot after or episodes already so it doesnt count
television,not_removed,im ditching arrow as well it used to be my favorite show but season really put a bad taste in my mouth and season was the nail in the coffin
television,not_removed,sigh i really dont want to but i think tyrant has just pushed me too far
television,not_removed,pretty much most of the fall stuff that isnt available on netflixamazon prime due to uni stuff i wont be able to watch anywhere near as many shows i could normally so will have to save it to the summer and have a massive binge watch session then
television,not_removed,supernatural probably i dont really know what even happened last season if the premiere can make sense of things for me i might keep watching i doubt it though
television,not_removed,i dumped botched by nature episodes in since its basically longer even more drawn out and boring then botched has become on top of that the patients in the after part are acting like things are like a billion times better even though i only saw like cases where there was a difference botched went into mid season finale and thats most likely it for me i was starting to do the rupaul asdr season but will be dumping it after the next episodesnatch game since i remembered that a this show hates plus sized queens so ginger is going to get screwed big time and b the trio from series is backrolaskatox and they are really annoying as a trio dumped masters of illusion bc this season was more and more and more of the i need a random volunteer from the audience bull and same reason with penn and teller fool us only reason wliia is staying vs me just checking it out on youtube after the episode is recorded is that the dvr recording levels are so low that im starting to get desperate for stuff to record dropped match game episodes in since the show is just so stupid id rather them do a retro night and play the stuff which is actually funny battlebots i got bored of episodes in but only keeping it since my uncle likes watching it would consider dropped adam ruins everything but the problem is that im already at a very low number of shows currently recording vs what i need to replaceadd to on the dvr
television,not_removed,shows i am droppingnever bothered catching up and for sure not going to now arrow tyrantwalking dead homeland gotham american horror story maybe even the flash if the writers stop using plot conveniences and start being a little less cheesy
television,not_removed,arrow and the strain dont give me something that you try and pass off as batman and tell me its batman in my book arrow is only a notch above that horrible show gotham either bring the real batman and the bat family to cw so we can do a live action young justice only missing characters for it robin and superboy or have enough confidence to do oliver queen justice the only reason i didnt drop arrow last season was because of the constantine and vixen cameos i was hoping he was going to show up more legends is eye candy sarah lance is pretty victor garbor is a good actor too so legends is acceptable i think these shows need to do a young justice and make episodes that look stand alone but eventually tie into one overall arching plot
television,not_removed,just dropped masters of sex after two eps of the new season when the characters start to complain about the same things as last season i cant hack it and i dropped agents of shield last season but will give it a shot now tht ghost rider is in it
television,not_removed,im not finishing this terrible mr robot season fuck them for ruining a show with such potential everyone is saying arrow but i bet the producers will revamp after the terrible reviews flashpoint will hopefully retcon olicity
television,not_removed,pretty much all of cws dc stuff arrow is just poor the flash as ive stated before is weighed down by too much melodrama and he cant do anything by himself even to save his life legends of tomorrow blah
television,not_removed,the pitch
television,not_removed,the faithless pessimist in me wants to drop stranger things now before im disappointed by next season but im always skeptical after a premier season with such a strong story its like whats said about music you have your whole life to make your first album and only a year to make your second thats why true detective season sucked apparently and why theyre allowing lots of time for season to be made because they know they already lost a large part of their audience and cant risk losing any more by rushing again that said im dropping true detective unless i hear some amazing reviews also the leftovers obviously has no intention of explaining wtf is happening and is all about some psychotic journey that mostly makes no sense out of whats occurring nor any of the characters motives ill probably watch it just to be a completist and add to my reasons to hate that hack damon lindelof responsible for also prometheus and lost both of which led nowhere
television,not_removed,the only episode im watching of arrow this season is during the night crossover its even worse when watching the flash and seeing that the creative team is capable of making a great show but then i remember guggenheim isnt involved go figure weirdly enough i think guggenheim wrote the best episode of arrow this year only it was on legends of tomorrow star city
television,not_removed,im staying i still have the littlest bit of hope in this season
television,not_removed,i actually thought arrow began somewhat strong last season or it wasnt bad better than the start the flash got off to imo gave me hope it maybe turned a corner not close to what it once was but retaining some amount of respectability and then it didnt it ended up highlighting everything wrong with what the show has devolved into im going to give this season a try it wouldnt shock me if i quit some episodes in if it keeps its current trajectory sad because of all the current dc universe shows it had the highest peak
television,not_removed,i quit arrow episodes in ugh just ugh
television,not_removed,i keep reading how the flash is better but why is it even considered good everything boils down to you need to run faster seriously why
television,not_removed,i want to drop arrow but i think hatewatching will be way more satisfactory i cant give this trainwreck up
television,not_removed,you know how much i hate arrow when i finished the question and it didnt take me a second to say arrow goddamn that show is just crap
television,not_removed,i was going to drop it but i want to see if theyre able to manage anything decent with chad coleman
television,not_removed,yup same here ill read the recaps if someones still doing them because theyre funny as hell but i dropped about into last season about the time felicity literally walked for the first time and walked out on him ridiculous
television,not_removed,i dropped it too and this is coming from a guy who kept with himym for all seasons and loves dc comics
television,not_removed,i lost hope when i saw that it was to air on the cw the only show to ever hit that channel that was watchable was flash and that was a massive surprise that still dabbles in teenagestyle drama but in a palatable way
television,not_removed,when felicity got out of her wheelchair to walk out on ollie i dont watch arrow but i just imagined her regaining the power to walk just based on her desire to dump her boyfriend
television,not_removed,whats worse is that that moment is not even the most ridiculous moment of the show remember that time when rasalgoul literally shishkabobed oliver with a sword through the fucking chest and threw him off a fucking cliff that was pretty retarded thankfully we got to forget how retarded that was when immediately next season oliver recovered thanks to herbs and cold snow next thing you know hes back to shooting arrows off of his motorcycle and parkouring his way through the city that was when the show jumped the shark felicity getting a cure for her paralysis and getting up from her wheelchair is only the third most ridiculous thing to happen on this fucking shitshow
television,not_removed,i stopped after they said ollie left the island that they alluded back to for seasons straight to go to china only to be brought back to the island before being rescued and then brought back to starling city like come the fuck on thats just a convoluted mess
television,not_removed,considering that the showrunners are pretty defiant in their defense of the felicity story arc in spite of the backlash thats probably not going to happen where it lost me was the entire bullshit argument that queens love for felicity was supposed to be superior to having a relationship with his son and the secret was something he had no hand in creating who the fuck on that writing staff thinks their children come second to their spouse or so what fucking planet do they live on look you can have a character behave as felicity did but you sure as shit cant make her right about that argument
television,not_removed,i know how you feel but seriously dont give them a chance thorough the whole season they had plenty on opportunities to fix what they did on the second half of season yet they shat on us like never before they managed to erase any remote chances we had to see big villains on the show they screwed the black archer and turned him into a clown who by the way people love him because ha ha doctor who so funny all the time they destroyed deathstroke and ended any chances we had to have manu bennet back for fucking sake they made fucking ras al ghul an olicitier who was killed in a pathetic duel in the dark and was never mentioned again do you see theres no hope for they will once again squeeze all the hype they can which unfortunately will still draw people who want to take a peak and watch just to see how it turns out i say no dont give them views or attention they dont deserve it not after deathstroke not after ras al ghul not after laurel
television,not_removed,its a shame because i preferred the atmosphere and cinematography far far more than twd
television,not_removed,yep thats about where i gave up too it started out pretty interesting but things went downhill fast in the second season
television,not_removed,it gets even worse after that i think ill stop too
television,not_removed,i like nick and strand but the rest of the characters are bad i hate how many people on the show just stand there while the zombies are slowly moving towards them to eat them
television,not_removed,i gave up after that because theres no incentive to stay it felt like a chore to watch every sunday especially with got on there was just nothing there to feel for the characters ill probably catch up soon though since my family all watches it together
television,not_removed,theres two things in the walking dead franchise i still give a damn about the comic and the telltale games everything else i couldnt honestly care less
television,not_removed,is fear getting a series
television,not_removed,best description ive seen i only made it through season and dropped it like a bad habit
television,not_removed,yeah i cant take ftwd any more either
television,not_removed,yeah i really really love postapocalypse stuff zombie or no doesnt matter if its cringey or plain bad usually i watch it anyway its my guilty pleasure but man fear the walking dead is so shit honestly the last episode before the midseason break was the most incoherent mess of a tv episode that ive ever seen actually glad that ive seen it because it was so bad it was hilarious
television,not_removed,fear the walking dead i got to the part where the teenage girl lured some maniacs to their boat and just gave up there a little parental supervision would have gone a loooooong way madison
television,not_removed,i wish it would just follow nick at this point i like strand too but im fine with all the other character dying
television,not_removed,you are lucky i sat with it until the break and it got worse i could not face another episode once it came back every character is almost remarkably unlikable
television,not_removed,i gave up on the very same episode and i dont even remember what the fuck they were doing its just stupidity all over again even worse than how twd does sometimes
television,not_removed,the new episodes started like weeks ago it was a nick only episode and it was great nick and strand are pulling this show mostly but i keep my hopes up a little longer i just hope that they will start killing of a few of the shitty characters
television,not_removed,theres some good stuff in the last few episodes but there are way too many stupid decisions which is a shame
television,not_removed,im only watching for alycia debnamcarey
television,not_removed,i stopped after the first season but the most accurate thing ive seen written about that show is that it built an immaculate chess board but then they decided to play checkers on it
television,not_removed,tyrant is my new falling skies which is to say a show that is objectively terrible but has a premise i really like so i keep watching it but its just terrible
television,not_removed,every season im let down but never enough to quit cuz then they put out some interesting teasers and it looks just interesting enough to engage again then itll just disappoint again and repeat and this season isnt even doing the teaser hype shit their lame mystery theme thing just screams we didnt think this one through yet
television,not_removed,i hear ya brother i loved the first half of the season thought it would knock it out the park but it really tailed off series i hated the start but nearer the end it kind of came together a bit i keep thinking i wont watch but hey witches could be interesting wasnt it just flatters to deceive i watch it with my gf and seems to like it more so i go along i dont hate it but feel it should be so much better i havent watched the latest series hotel just yet but if its poor i may have to tell the gf im out they end up going on these completely uninteresting tangents in every season
television,not_removed,same this is a show that always starts off amazing and ends horribly im just not wiling to go through that again
television,not_removed,i totally agree i loved the first two seasons i didnt finish three four was pretty solid and i watched that whole year but gave up last year after like three episodes that season had no direction at all ill probably try this season again but i dont have high hopes
television,not_removed,i loved season but i couldnt really get into season should i even bother watching
television,not_removed,i actually stopped with season i really liked seasons but seemed to drag on and i just couldnt bring myself to watch so yeah unless season is remarkable i wont be watching either
television,not_removed,man if only they had a full final season i remember being happy when they said it was going to be only episodes i thought it would be the ideal number so we wouldnt have fillers or shit like that for gods sake how dumb i was was phenomenal but unfortunately was rushed and maybe it would have been even better if it were episodes instead of only
television,not_removed,solution stop following politics only watch zombies
television,not_removed,just watch game of thrones and you can have both
television,not_removed,us politics suck right now
television,not_removed,i dont even know why but im still gonna watch it hate watching i guess
television,not_removed,knowing twd we wont find out who died until the mid season side note two of the words in this post accidentally autocorrect ed to karol a sign perhaps
television,not_removed,its gotten so repetitive i want to see how it ends but i dont know how many more times i can watch the same plot line before it gets there
television,not_removed,me too im not going to do hours and hours of terrible decision making by both the characters and the writers just for a few moments of cool action thriller sequences
television,not_removed,what would it take for it to blow your mind curious i already know who gets whacked thanks to the leaks and i think its a really anticlimactic result
television,not_removed,i quit halfway through the second season frank darabont should never been fired
television,not_removed,if the first episode back sucks or doesnt resolve the cliffhanger in a way that redeems itself im out
television,not_removed,not dropping it but as a cord cutter who buys season passes to about shows per year that are mustsee it looks like im going to wait for it to show up on netflix in about months its lost that cache i lost a lot of my enthusiasm for the show once i found out that kirkman doesnt have any plans for a conclusion and now that it has ironically considering how amc drove darabount out over budget issues become a giant cash cow for amc they arent going to let the showrunners build to any conclusion at least not until they drive it into the ground at some point and are forced to i wouldnt be surprised if show goes for another years unfortunately
television,not_removed,yeah im in the same boat ill be watching the first episode to see who was killed but after that i doubt ill keep watching im tired of seeing the same thing over and over because nobody learns from their mistakes
television,not_removed,ill only watch twd with a group we all poke fun at it
television,not_removed,what did you just say to me
television,not_removed,i just started watching suits im on loving it so far
television,not_removed,i dont get why people hate this season so much i thought it brought atleast some of the magic back plus the direction the show went in was unexpected for me and fairly interesting i think it was miles better than anything from and the whole side story with louis is fucking stupid though and i hate donnas stupid face shes a walking deus ex machina
television,not_removed,i started watching this season after a few seasons missed its so bad what the fuck happened
television,not_removed,admittedly so was last season i stopped watching last season and watched the first episode of this new season i literally couldnt even
television,not_removed,had the so not wanted to watch it i probably wouldnt have bought the season pass cord cutter here as it stands now unless theres a major change over these last episodes even free on amazon prime down the road i probably wont finish the series it was always fluff but until it was at least well made fluff
television,not_removed,dropped off before this season
television,not_removed,the saddest downfall with arrow this seasons atrocious in so many ways the plot is retarded the dialogue is cringe worthy its lost its spark from the first seasons
television,not_removed,couple of episodes was enough for me its one of those cable comedies that forgets to actually be funny so i am watching some dramalite that also isnt very good
television,not_removed,something actually plotprogressing actually happened in the latest episode you wouldnt miss anything to skip forward
television,not_removed,im caught up and its painful at times to watch the rock i generally dont care about his acting cause i understand the role hes supposed to be playing but holy shit he is tough to watch in this show
television,not_removed,the only story arch keeping me still involved is which team ricky is going to sign with after that im not sure anything else will keep my interest
television,not_removed,i gave up on that shitfest after the third episode of it was typical athlete indulgent bullshit with the rock in really expensive suits
television,not_removed,i find it enjoyable enough and since theres not a ton on during the summer and since i can do something else around the house while watching it so it has stayed on my schedule not exactly glowing praise though
television,not_removed,yeah i made it one more episode further before i gave up on it i figured starting oitnb would be a better investment of my time
television,not_removed,how they renewed this garbage over the brink is beyond me
television,not_removed,now that the kids are getting older their horrible acting is much more noticeable
television,not_removed,how the heck youre still watching modern family is beyond me
television,not_removed,truth be told the only reason i am hanging on to this show is that is a bingeable when i have a show hole and i am curious what they are going to do with obergruppenfuhrer smith and nobusuke tagomi all the other characters in this show are beyond retarded
television,not_removed,is all of as dull as its first or so episodes
television,not_removed,really i thought the latest season was the best since the first
television,not_removed,i think the last season was the best one yet what are your objections
television,not_removed,oh no i just started the strain is it that bad now
television,not_removed,mr robot was a mindfucki gave up after episodes of
television,not_removed,oh man theyd have to turn aos into arrow before i would drop that one i look forward to aos every week when its on
television,not_removed,aos is a show that would be great on cablestreaming but suffers being on network tv i really enjoy the characters and the overall arc of the stories but i hate some of the procedural aspects of the show and the outright filler get the show off of abc and reduce the episode count from down to per season and youd have something more people would enjoy i think
television,not_removed,the walking dead has decent writing have they fired everyone in charge of season where i dropped the show
television,not_removed,im sticking with ftwd against my better judgment there was a scene in this weeks episode where nick and that chick who saved him luisa maybe prepped to leave their community to get supplies by rubbing walker blood on their skin they entered a walkerfilled enclosement held down the one walker had a whole conversation without being sniffed out by any of the walkers in there then rubbed externallyfound blood on their skin and clothes no guts or anything like they usually do in twd and left without being sniffed out by any of the walkers in the enclosement none of the walkers even made any noise it took me completely out of it
television,not_removed,ill keep up with the walking dead because it has decent writing in what bizzarro universe does the walking dead have decent writing
television,not_removed,i was in the same boat on mr robot but its really started to pick up in the last few episodes would definitely recommend sticking with it
television,not_removed,yep im right there with you im giving up on suits too and i was so looking forward to enjoying the second season of mr robot but gave up after the third episode its not that i found anything annoying about the show i just found myself feeling like watching the latest episodes would be a chore
television,not_removed,you gave mr robot up after episodes in season right and you liked the first season
television,not_removed,containment was cancelled
television,not_removed,ya zoo is gd terrible the first few episodes of season were fun it got rrrrrrreaallll bad
television,not_removed,agreed i was really excited to see season two and just felt very let down by it the stuff related to s the weird wesannalise halfsexual halffamilial dynamic and the fact that frank or bonnie were implicated in some twisted scheme every other episode really shot the credibility for me i hate to quit things so ill probably catch the first episode on hulu or something to see if it somehow got better but shondaland has kind of lost its luster for me
television,not_removed,season one was a great mystery season took that mystery and cranked it up like where everyone was involved in shady nefarious business and it became one gigantic soap opera the second season was incredibly dissapointing in my opinion barely even watchable at all
television,not_removed,the best comedies are where the characters can just be sitting around talking and still be entertaining
television,not_removed,it was great when it was dark comedy i stopped enjoying it when it became dark dramedy aka the part that everyone seems to praise ill check on it because im hoping itll go back to more comedy
television,not_removed,thats a shame about legends i think its perfect comic book fun barely any of the soap opera moments the other cw shows have just superheroes teaming up
television,not_removed,thats an issue im really having with all these new high concept shows unreal last man on earth even mr robot just dont follow through in their second seasons
television,not_removed,mr robot is actually killing it definitely would recommend watching when you have a chunk of free time or a long weekend its not something you casually watch which i get is why some people give up on it
television,not_removed,i give you a lot of credit for sticking with it i gave up after season i thought was a good enough ending but wow i cant believe its still going
television,not_removed,really season was one of their best but i fear they lost their best writer this season robbie thompson
television,not_removed,i usually give stuff a chance but quantico lasted about episodes for me very unlike me just didnt grab me a little too much stupid people doing stupid stuff for me to overlook despite liking the lead woman and a couple of other cast members
television,not_removed,quit quantico midway through last season the story just got ridiculous
television,not_removed,the
television,not_removed,im with you im fine with the death the problem was that bellamy was completely out of character
television,not_removed,what do you think ruined mr robot i think this season hasnt been as good as the first but its still pretty up there in my opinion id be interested in your thoughts
television,not_removed,flashpoint wont affect arrow at all
television,not_removed,im about to drop flash too due to how much they hype yet never delived they make thousands of promises or at least thats what fans hear and then we get a stupid lame race on the finale come on they have so much potential to be good but they manage to screw everything
television,not_removed,youre reasoning for wanting to drop stranger things is some of the worst logic ive ever heard holy shit is that foolish youre going to stop watching a show that youre enjoying because you dont want to be disappointed by a second season that doesnt exist yet ok
television,not_removed,your argument against the leftovers is ridiculous lindelof said from day one that the show would never explain what happened the show is called the leftovers because it focuses on the ones that were left behind
television,not_removed,nor any of the characters motives what exactly are you referring to here which characteractions did you want the motive explained for
television,not_removed,wtf if you miss out on the third and final season of the leftovers because you simply want to understand everything then i feel bad for you thats one of the best shows on tv and the second season was absolutely phenomenal plus at least part of the season takes place in australia which implies that some questions are going to be addressed if not answered
television,not_removed,i agree that episode really intrigued me but its not like its hard to compete with the other episodes
television,not_removed,he can write good episodes his episodes are consistently some of the better ones hes just a shitty showrunner
television,not_removed,people say it was the best episode of lot and arrow but i think it was pretty lame it was obvious they wanted to bring manu bennet back but couldnt do it so they called a complete stranger to play as his son oliver had some poorly done beard and diggles son wasnt charismatic enough to be the central part of the episode i dont see how people even wanted him on the second lot team oh and the two of three obligatory felicity mentions because how the fuck would they talk about anything related to arrow without mentioning her
television,not_removed,its like a rebuilding season so i guess im gonna check it out at least its a change glee was shit then had a big rebuilding season and while it was still shit it was at least more interesting shit
television,not_removed,it gets a lot better
television,not_removed,yeah the flash is really cashing in on all its season good will they pull out just interesting enough twists often enough to keep you from really noticing but its starting to push it
television,not_removed,its not that good people just eat up all those comic easter eggs and story adoptions when they are basically shoved in the plot everything is so linear
television,not_removed,i dropped it on season it was literally the same crap every episode flash meets new metahuman gets ass kicked trains and strategizes ends up beating him and a short epilogue with the guy in the wheelchair it got pretty good after the man in yellow but apparently they are reusing the same type of storyline another evil character with flashs power in every season
television,not_removed,the flash is good but its definetely overrated
television,not_removed,thats pretty much it she got shot and was crippled for like one episode then another character created a chip that could cure paralysis in the next episode she initially tried to walk and then failed but by the episode i guess she properly motivated enough for it to work
television,not_removed,i actually liked that episode where ras seemingly killed him the fight itself was badass and the way they ended the midseason finale by seemingly killing off the main character was ballsy everything after that was downhill tho from the way they brought him back to the nonsensical reason they were even fighting in the first place
television,not_removed,whats even more perplexing is that they had felicity tell her mom that sometimes your significant other will lie to you because they love you and that its okay in the episode right before i dont think the show ever addressed this blatant hypocrisy either
television,not_removed,you know what youre probably right i dont even have any emotional investment in the show anyway i watched the trailer and didnt really feel any hype
television,not_removed,third try more like at least ten the show is pulling in huge numbers for cable and is amcs no show behind of course twd as they say it run forever
television,not_removed,already did bud
television,not_removed,i too loved season but was disappointed by season to me season bit off too many different subjects and never really tied them together well parts of it were very good but overall it was a mess if you absolutely hated season and didnt even finish it i wouldnt bother with i enjoyed all seasons but its pretty much been all downhill since coven imo season was great loved it season had too much going on and just never sorted itself out coven is my second favorite but its not very horrory i just really liked the relationships and fights between all the strong characters started great but after episodes or so the only interesting arc ends and by the end of the show its pretty terrible main arc is the worst arc and the ending was a travesty hotel seemed more about lady gaga and mass sexuality than anything else it had some really good performances and some great charactersconcepts but i felt they never got the chance they deserved because gaga stole all the limelight i will watch the new season because i still enjoy the show even if since season its never been in my top of the season but im not expecting miracles edit to answer your question id give season a try unless you abhorred season and if you dont enjoy that just go ahead and give up
television,not_removed,i wish i could but politics is like a baby walking through a slaughter house you know something horrible is going to happen but the anticipation keeps you glued to it
television,not_removed,honestly i chose the path of neither i dont believe in voting but at the same time im not into zombie movies
television,not_removed,that is an understatement
television,not_removed,only wayching to see the comic parts unfold
television,not_removed,you are going to watch it for the same reason we all watch it that is because while it is usually a mediocre at best show when it is occasionally good it is great
television,not_removed,theyve confirmed its in the first episode but i already know who gets whacked off thanks to the leaks so its totally anticlimactic anyone looking forward to that episode that wastes an hour focuses on tara and heath
television,not_removed,the first half of the season is all negan backstory
television,not_removed,on the road find safe haven feud with another group safe haven destroyed on the road rinse and repeat
television,not_removed,according to kirkman it will never end
television,not_removed,is it exactly who was expected to die from the comics
television,not_removed,what leaks are you speaking of
television,not_removed,pls bb pm me and let me know
television,not_removed,ive noticed ive made fun of it too lol first season will always be the best one
television,not_removed,then you might want to bail after this one and enjoy the memories
television,not_removed,it mostly has to do with where ended up and now the show has to deal with the fallout mostly because the central premise of what has happened is entirely bullshit what the show decided to say is that what mike was doing by practicing law without a piece of paper allowing him to was unethical and immoral however this flies in face of logic because there is simply nothing separating mike from any legal attorney at this point notice that the writers stayed away from the one argument that was the most glaring omission of daring anyone to audit mikes past cases to find anything wrong with them because theres no real counterargument i had this same debate with friend and i pointed out that mike isnt attempting something he would need to develop physical skills hes not trying to pass himself off as a doctor for example and exactly like a real lawyer for his first cases he was always just harveys assistant even when he got his first solo cases harvey provided guidance hence at this point there is nothing that mike cant do that a real lawyer couldnt worse this show has the characters doing actually very illegal things to help mike out
television,not_removed,i dont understand why people jump into a random season without watching the previous ones do you mind telling me why you went straight to the newest season just curious
television,not_removed,yea i gave up on that after episodes myself
television,not_removed,wow i completely men in blacked on the brink tht was a good show now tht i remember it
television,not_removed,i think a lot of the fault lies in the writing theyve gotten so complacent i think its only got more season after this upcoming one
television,not_removed,the actor who plays luke seems doomed to the frankie munizrobert iler route now
television,not_removed,i was surprised by how good megan fox was in it plus i love brooklyn nine nine and theyre going to have a crossover episode with new girl
television,not_removed,once they dropped jess being the main character and made it more about nick and schmidt it got better i like it when jess was the mc but it has improved since they changed it up
television,not_removed,season was a struggle the son ruins the show
television,not_removed,i guess technically probably that showrunner quitwas fired over creative differences that mostly stemmed from the finale
television,not_removed,im not saying it has amazing writing but id say characters like rick and glenn are pretty well written
television,not_removed,i gave up mr robot after episodes liked the season that is literally what uwittedfox said
television,not_removed,no it was a limited series it finished its run kinda unfinished in the plots though
television,not_removed,after a character died it went to shit in my opinion
television,not_removed,barely any of the soap opera moments the other cw shows have only if you ignore the entirety of the kendraraycarter love triangle
television,not_removed,yeah the season picks up but i get what you mean sometimes the slow pace gets me distracted and i check my phone and then miss something i seem to gloss over during scenes with elliot in his mind and pay attention to everything else im not super invested more just something to watch for me
television,not_removed,i think next is season im only caught up to seaon i had stuff to do but now i have not the will to follow it anymore
television,not_removed,im only caught up to season i planned to finish the show but now i just havent the timewill
television,not_removed,right would have had more spartans though the grounders warriors could be pretty tough
television,not_removed,at which point when he stopped being the jerk upon landing and became a leader when he really became a leader when he followed the usurper at arcadia i wasnt fond of that one im still watching im hoping they wind it up before theyre cancelled
television,not_removed,the directing and cinematography are still on point but the adrenaline and momentum and mystery that sucked me in in just feel abscent season felt full of excitement and as a level above other shows now it feels more like all the other silver age tv shows because the golden age died with breaking bad and mad men passing
television,not_removed,this is confirmed ugh the comic flashpoint changed every existing comic by messing with the timeline i was hoping it would somehow undo arrows downfall
television,not_removed,would you like me to name you some shows and movies and albums that went to shit after their first seasonmoviealbum because this is not some uncommon occurrence thus making it completely logical to assume it can be shit especially with season being the debut for the writerscreators of the show so yes im skeptical and will wait for the reviews on season before watching it because i cant imagine a second season being better and i know they had time to write their first season whats your reason for being so blindly optimistic well i liked the first season thats a poorly thought out argument
television,not_removed,shows rarely keep up the level in their second season i guess hes just anxious about it
television,not_removed,just because the creator of a show says im making a show without a cohesive plot that will drop closely followed characters and storylines like they were insignificant doesnt mean i have to like it now all because he was honest if he had told us that about lost would that have made losts ending acceptable absolutely not
television,not_removed,the entire guilty remnant for one especially patti and meg and his solution to that was to have them conveniently stay silent also kevins dad and half the things kevin does its like he doesnt think out the consequences and wayne literally everything about wayne still needs to be explained i feel but i know it wont be also the girls who disappeared in miracle so they could join the guilty remnant its really like the worlds most unrealistic terrorist group entirely composed by people with the most unrealistic motives i cant even get started about the hotel and how none of that made any sense whatsoever and wasnt even coherent enough to be symbolism all the characters in the hotel not drinking the water his clothes determining who he was at the hotel all that was just bizarre for the sake of being bizarre
television,not_removed,stopped watching midway season
television,not_removed,every time they address something in that show they raise more questions like lost and everyone i know who has dropped the show dropped it because they knew the show was going nowhere most people guys particularly just look at femaletargeted programming if you disagree dont like drama without a good explanation and resolve this doesnt appeal to a lot of people because anyone could write some random ass scenes and character motives if they dont have to explain it this is exactly why people were pissed about the ending of lost because they wanted it all to tie together and explain the significance of it all and they instead went from scifi to some shitty god metaphor in the last seasons that still explained nothing at least with the leftovers hes basically said yeah this is just some fucked up journey accept it or dont im definitely not alone in this my feelings about the show as everyone ive mentioned this show to not only doesnt watch it for the reason but has told me its because of its drama without explanation like why would anyone join the guilty remnant im only downvoted because the only people with an opinion on the leftovers are obviously those who actually watch it and those who watch it had to accept from the beginning that shit wasnt going to add up the people im saying this doesnt appeal to wouldnt chime in because they dont know enough about the show because they dont watch it again because it doesnt appeal to them
television,not_removed,rebuilding the team was the way to go but is the current lineup really necessary i have no clue why they want to use curtis as a fighter when he is clearly more gifted in tech but i guess its just another fan favorite thing also i dont think i can stand the kid black canary especially after all the disservice the writers did to the last
television,not_removed,hahah yeah i started watching with my girlfriend and every episode at some point had a conclusionhappy ending and i would be like wait wells is going to do some shady shit and hed always do i still loved it though at some point they got rid of the bad guy of the week which i hated and focused more on the central storyline which i loved
television,not_removed,way understatements its become nothing about that monster trump and people trying to make hillary look bad when the reality is that the media is hiding stuff from us and trump is said to be way worse them obama ever has been
television,not_removed,i watch it because its entertaining i dont think it was ever great im invested in their characters and i just want to see their journey at this point
television,not_removed,can you pm me who died
television,not_removed,can you pm who dies
television,not_removed,dont forget moral dilemma that makes them question if theyre still the good guys
television,not_removed,spoiling dead fans have people taking pictures of the actors filming in the atlanta area when actors stop showing up it means that their character has been killed on that basis its been determined who negan likely killed is
television,not_removed,what the hell are you doing here
television,not_removed,i couldnt be bothered catching up
television,not_removed,problem is a person would either have to have access to the old seasons and the patience to binge watch a show
television,not_removed,how is that even going to work theyre set about about as far away as they can be within major cities of the continental us
television,not_removed,i didnt even know new girl was on fox until now i thought it was like a tbs show or something but thats probably because its always replayed there and i dont tune in to fox unless i know something i watch is on their programming has been all over the place for years with a few exceptions
television,not_removed,winston made the last season for me hes easily the best character
television,not_removed,the first rule of any apocalyptic or post apocalyptic showmovie should be no child characters i honestly cant think of a single example where a child or preteen character was ever not a total detriment to the showmovie
television,not_removed,that show was a wreck when i left it and every time i tried to get back into it it was just the same old thing athletic young person somehow loses peripheral vision and gets cornered in a field by monsters who walk slower than a human doing a brisk walk it just made the story not matter because the writers had to dumb down all our heroes to make the zombies threatening long live days later
television,not_removed,sorry youre right its just fucking poorly written and i had just woken up
television,not_removed,you are of course talking about frightened inmate yes
television,not_removed,yeah i stopped watch after season too it just became too much i got tired of seeing everyone die but when one the winchester brothers died they found some way to be brought back
television,not_removed,when he followed the usurper just didnt seem like something hed do especially when he attacked their allies
television,not_removed,seriously there are some amazing shows shot after bb and mm like the leftovers the nigh of fargo narcos and several other
television,not_removed,the only person that flashpoint is going to even slightly affect is diggle
television,not_removed,i read someone in reddit that the season pretty much looked like it was written with a role reversal some of the felicitys plots belonged to laurel and vice versa especially the grave thing itd make sense to set up curtis if youre going to have felicity die someone along the line but now they are bringing in a techy to jump out on the streets
television,not_removed,curtis just doesnt interest or excited me in the slightest i feel like he is only there to fill the hole left by ray palmer leaving to do legends but even that stuff isnt utilized so far anything he brings to the plot is already covered by felicity which is a whole nother can of worms maybe when they actually let him be mr fantastic itll help and as for kid canary they just royally fucked up theres no reason they should have to be doing this other than fixing something they chose to break
television,not_removed,and lets be real if hillary was half the corrupt criminal as so many people say she is shed be in jail theres zero evidence to support that theory people have made up their mind about her from nothing more than a gut feeling which has been influenced by over twenty years of right wing propaganda to smear her reputation the fact is shes been investigated about her emails the fbi didnt find any evidence of intentional wrong doing shes had like what a dozen benghazi hearings and none of those found her in the wrong theres all these pay to play accusations about whats going on in the clinton foundation but if she did that it wasnt against the law so even the argument about her being unethical is unsubstantiated tripe i wanted to hate clinton too but the fact is that in order to believe all the bullshit that is spewed about her you need to buy into wild unsubstantiated conspiracy theories and reject reality
television,not_removed,pjotr
television,not_removed,dumbledore
television,not_removed,that wasnt really the case in this last season though actually i think this last season was quite good for twd especially the last episode was great right untill those last goddamn seconds
television,not_removed,donna i need you to pick up my dry cleaning but jessica cant know about it
television,not_removed,easy enough
television,not_removed,i guess i just prefer to see the whole story unfold i have no problem catching up on a show over time
television,not_removed,im assuming the new girl crew take a trip to new york shenanigans ensue
television,not_removed,coach moved to new york last season and winstons a cop so either of them are possible links
television,not_removed,schmidt will receive an award from his high school in new york so they go out there for that zooey talked about it last night on jimmy kimmell
television,not_removed,i assume airplanes exist in both shows
television,not_removed,well they did do the big superbowl episode last year the party at princes house
television,not_removed,yea season was the lowest point of the show even if you arent on board with what came after i would say theres no arguing that it got objectively better from there when they fired the showrunner
television,not_removed,nice to know that someone thought the same thing he never seemed to have his heart in that either it just played outodd they should just clean things up and finish it with a twohour finale with the first part of the last hour being set at some point in the future and the last part in the later future again show how things turn out and please not it all repeats with war
television,not_removed,the way i see it the golden age was when there were less shows but they were all amazing the silver age is for the era of scripted annual series with about of them being good and the rest utter shit but all having enough competition where none rise above the the rest and get mass societal impact like lost sopranos and breaking bad achieved before tv truly blew up
television,not_removed,most of those people are bitching about my unpopular opinion of lindelofs work and ive gotten downvoted of the time ive mentioned my thoughts on him but you tell yourself thats them exclusively agreeing with you
television,not_removed,they straight up murdered a bunch of people in their sleep for food morality was still a big theme in the last season
television,not_removed,bravo for the contributors to this thread sadly this parody showed more thought than the current season
television,not_removed,i never realized how much i wanted winston to interact with the brooklyn cast
television,not_removed,who does he play though coach or stevie schillens from the
television,not_removed,i miss coach
television,not_removed,yeah i guess but they didnt sit around discussing it for days like in season they just went ahead and did it morality will always be a big theme but i think the emphasis on are we still the good guys if we do this was pretty much gone
television,not_removed,id assume hell play coach with a little joke where someone says he looks familiar or something his coach part in new girl was larger i think i havent actually seen all of brooklyn nine nine
television,not_removed,no youre the puppet
television,not_removed,i appreciated the topical references
television,not_removed,fringe does this amazingly well
television,not_removed,im ron burgandy
television,not_removed,definitely buffy the vampire slayer and its spinoff angel which you can start watching once you finish season of buffy these two shows perfected exactly what youre looking for in the supernatural genre and everything made since then have been mere carbon copies of what these two shows achieved the xfiles might also be up your alley supernatural is also really good but dawdles a bit too much on the standalone episodes also supernatural was supposed to end in season which is the true climax of the series whether you want to continue after that is up to you but the series has never been the same since season not supernatural but scifi battlestar galactica make sure you begin with the miniseries i cant recommend this one enough
television,not_removed,i was actually thinking of rewatching buffy thanks
television,not_removed,i was writing a question starting with am i the only one but it got removed i just copied and pasted didnt proofread
television,not_removed,thanks for this link terrific
television,not_removed,pretty much the best tv show ever made
television,not_removed,forrest whitaker doesnt get nearly enough credit for that masterful job in season one of the best seasons of television in recent memory
television,not_removed,the best show of all time and i say that as a massive fan of the sopranos and the wire the shield is the alpha and omega of television dramaand its a damn shame nobody ever talks about it
television,not_removed,i was always amazed that they could have a character that was both protagonist and antagonist at the same time
television,not_removed,lost is an awesome tv show probably one of the most engrossing and entertaining shows ive ever seen i even liked the last few seasons some people didnt like the ending but you will just need to judge for yourself fun fact the pilot episode was the most expensive tv pilot ever made at the time the only reason it happened is because the network president knew he was going to be canned so he greenlit as many shows as he could
television,not_removed,youre a little late the partys over my friend
television,not_removed,reposting bot at its finest
television,not_removed,spoiler alert the twist is that you lose interest in season
television,not_removed,ive never seen an episode of lost ever anyone willing to trade brains to watch it brand new again
television,not_removed,is the time commitment pretty big i heard worth it
television,not_removed,crazy im rewatching lost and wow terry oquinn is an awesome actor he makes me actually feel uncomfortable in this
television,not_removed,i cant wait for this season finale
television,not_removed,its not worth it
television,not_removed,i think he is having flashes into the future like season
television,not_removed,i saw it liked it but would not watch it again unlike breaking bad ive seen that atleast times all the way through now i want to watch it again dammit
television,not_removed,what if we tradeand i wont watch it again
television,not_removed,did you ever think about what happens if you get your brain back and you think its the worst show ever but youve got the entire seasons right there fresh in your brain
television,not_removed,it will piss you off and confuse the shit out of you its good to watch in bits and pieces but certainly not bingeworthy
television,not_removed,yepi am sure they will solve all mysteries and subplots
television,not_removed,if anything goes wrong will be my constant
television,not_removed,i miss breaking bad so much too at least theres game of thrones still if you follow that one
television,not_removed,matthew fox is going to be a greater than life superstar
television,not_removed,depends on the specific show and how its organized filmed written etc there are situations in which all scenarios can occur and for different reasons there isnt a general answer but understand for the most part shows are primarily shot on a production stageflooretc not on location of course it various especially when we discuss more premium shows but its way way cheaper and easier to shoot in the companies lot on your own sets rather than dealing with doing on location shoots in public
television,not_removed,many shows shoot episodes in order and use the location when they need it casual the hulu original show makes their episodes at a time a director directs episodes and theyll film the episode scenes out of order and likely uses all of their locations in the two episodes at once
television,not_removed,depends broadcast tv like ncis is shot per episode but only or days of the day shoot will be outside the soundstages other shows like doctor who are shot in blocks of episodes others like peaky blinders shoot the whole season all at once shooting out each location before moving to the next then theres game of thrones which has a crew in each city that shoots their stuff concurrently while block shooting in a carousel arrangement
television,not_removed,most network tv is shot episodically a writerdirector team work on an episode and then the next episode will have a different pairor just one changed like other commenters have said it totally depends on the show
television,not_removed,the vast majority of the time it is done episode by episode a show might block shoot episodes at a time but ive never seen them do more than that at once
television,not_removed,true detective
television,not_removed,every actor has his ups and downs pretty soon his going to bless us with international treasure
television,not_removed,id like a national treasure or sorcerers apprentice sort of show something charming and lighthearted
television,not_removed,revive
television,not_removed,is he against doing television or does he just not have any offers
television,not_removed,i would be for this depending on the show of course if its a show that allows him to scenerychew for an hour im all in
television,not_removed,wheres my fucking national treasure adaptation
television,not_removed,damnit now i want him in fargo
television,not_removed,what do you guys think i am done giving a shit about nicolas cage they guys just does not care about what he does go watch uss indianapolis men of courage yes it is shit but cage was the worst part
television,not_removed,as long as nicolas cage can play nicolas cage and have a freakout every episode
television,not_removed,im all for this
television,not_removed,that is you know what im okay with that
television,not_removed,oh shit
television,not_removed,costar will smith
television,not_removed,this is some if the best tv i have ever seen still holds up
television,not_removed,kevin is a madman
television,not_removed,oh my god all i ever wanted to know about love and adolescence is written and shown in the wonder years obviously its a pretty white washed show with white kid problems but the heart of what it is is always in the right place no other kids show that i can think of attempted to tackle such meaningful story arcs and i dont think any future show will ever quite do it as well
television,not_removed,my thoughts exactly
television,not_removed,boy meets world which stars freddies brother is also pretty great at teaching life lessons
television,not_removed,what is your opinion of freaks and geeks out of curiosity
television,not_removed,yeah totally i actually just watched a couple of clips from it that show though was played more like a comedic multi cam which it was and although there was a lot of heartfelt moments it was mostly comedy with a studio audience providing background sounds
television,not_removed,freaks and geeks is a great show and one thats really different because its one of the only hour long comedy shows to ever exist to my knowledge it dealt with the high school experience in its own way mostly focusing on the outsiders as they try to find their place in the world while knowing it doesnt lie within the socially accepted realm because of this they didnt go as headlong into melodramatic love story lines like wonder years did but it was also way funnier i think apatow writes like comedy to heart where as wonder years felt more like comedy to heart
television,not_removed,the actress not the character wouldve been interesting if they made an archie stranger things crossover
television,not_removed,i used to collect archie comics and shipped ethel and jughead so hard i will definitely be checking out the show
television,not_removed,did they just post a stranger things spoiler in the first sentence of the article
television,not_removed,barb deserved better than what happened to her
television,not_removed,its been years since ive picked one up but im all on board for this it seems like the unexpected quirky shows are some of the most enjoyable content lately i crossed the event horizon of barblove from reading shannon purser is freaking awesome in my mind shes a hero to all fangirls and i hope she goes far
television,not_removed,relevant
television,not_removed,the word reboot really has no meaning anymore does it
television,not_removed,im amazed people even care about this character she had maybe minutes screentime in like hours
television,not_removed,look i read the old comics my grandfather had and loved them but is there really any demand for an archie series right now
television,not_removed,why would they cast barb as ethel shes supposed to be a stick figure this show is doomed from the getgo anything that raises a red flag like this edit oh god grundy is a hot chick in her dilton has been cast as an asian kid josie is the token black converted from white the claytons and pop tate remain black of course tina patel is of course played by someone named olivia ryan stern since its only racist if you recast a black person as white
television,not_removed,barb was a jealous concern troll i didnt like her that said i do like that she was in the show her role was important in showing that nancy was an independent thinker that saw through her jealousy
television,not_removed,an archie reboot can we add that to the list of things no one ever asked for and no one wanted also who played fanfavorite character barb on netflixs summer phenom since when was barb a fanfavorite
television,not_removed,another archie cartoon these guy do realize that no one under actually read that
television,not_removed,this barb thing is really annoying her parents didnt even care about her why should i
television,not_removed,who
television,not_removed,who
television,not_removed,right know they have horrror comic series one with zombies the other a sabrina the teenage witch series where the witches are human sacrifice devil worshipping witches
television,not_removed,dont get your hopes too high read up on who archies ex girlfriend on the show is youll never guess who it is
television,not_removed,ew is notorious for not caring at all about spoilng things
television,not_removed,yes she certainly did it did go against trope so i was impressed with that at least
television,not_removed,just because there is no demand doesnt mean it cant be successful and find a new audiencethe new comics are pretty good too so they dont have a shortage of material
television,not_removed,the comics have been going through a resurgence afterlife with archie was big where they redid it as a horror comic and right now both archie and jughead have solid solo series
television,not_removed,maybe as a comedy yes but not as what theyre doing turning it into pretty little liars
television,not_removed,theyre sold in every grocery store here someone must be buying them
television,not_removed,pop tate is italian in the comics at least and grundy was changed for story purposes
television,not_removed,its actually going through a major rebrand
television,not_removed,it isnt a cartoon it is a live action cw show
television,not_removed,you should see afterlife with archie it was one of my favourite ongoings until the regular delays became too much for me solid book with great art though
television,not_removed,im and i read the comics a lot as a kid
television,not_removed,archie comics have gotten weirdly good in recent years
television,not_removed,im not the typical person by any stretch but i quite like archie comics im only i realize its all subjective but i like the innocence of them and the sort of happy days type of sitcom feel everything cant be grimdark all the time
television,not_removed,yeah no
television,not_removed,im so tired of everyone jacking off to her in every corner of the internet
television,not_removed,barb from stranger things
television,not_removed,neat
television,not_removed,and both of them are absolutely fantastic
television,not_removed,huh ok ill head over to wikipedia and check it out what
television,not_removed,what in the absolute fuck
television,not_removed,it better not be archie they need to try to stay true to the comics
television,not_removed,it did go against trope wait in what way
television,not_removed,theres a zombie archie comic a supernatural sabrina series a slice of life modern archie a soap opera married archie an archie that fights the predator etc why the fuck cant there be a twin peakspretty little liars archie on the cw
television,not_removed,youre not wrong
television,not_removed,except in afterlife with archie which actually is also pretty great
television,not_removed,looks like we really hit home for some people
television,not_removed,are they ive read the first issue of both but i didnt feel the same way for them that i did for archie and jughead i love those a lot i wish archie comics would reboot sabrina the teenage witch in the same style as the new archie i know that shes going to be in the next jughead issue so maybe theres hope
television,not_removed,i disagree both tend to succeed only because they are derivatives from works that are completely different in tone neither sabrine nor afterlife offer anything meaningful enough to stand on their own same reason riverdale is going to suck actually it takes a really rare kind of stupid or arrogant to forgo an adaptation of waids reboot in favor of a petty little liars with archie
television,not_removed,i know i was shocked too
television,not_removed,you looked it up
television,not_removed,virgin dies first
television,not_removed,so far as i know this is the first time archies gone liveaction i thought maybe theyd wanna start on a lighter note
television,not_removed,they always did gimmicky one offs but they changed the actual comics and rebooted it a year or so ago it has continuity and is more grounded in reality
television,not_removed,i think so afterlifes first issue is good but it really picks up in the issues afterwards sabrina i think has been great from the start but it definitely gets better as well a lot of it for me comes down to the writing though sacasas writing hits the perfect level of creepiness the books need while also staying very true to all the characters at least for he most part it does sort of do the core opposite of what waids archie book is trying to do though a book i also love archie is telling an archie story with just enough of it changed for it to be fresh and different afterlifesabrina on the other hand are changing basically everything but keeping just enough for it still to be archie and the gang funnily enough i think the best issue out of both series is the afterlife issue that focuses on sabrina one of the best horror one and done comics ive ever read its also probably important to note that they dont share a universe both are totally different stories
television,not_removed,unfortunately at least i know one show i wont be watching
television,not_removed,that only counts for virgins by choice virgins because they cant get none are just as likely to be killed
television,not_removed,not exactly the but no one really remembers crappy tv films
television,not_removed,i was really hoping that link was
television,not_removed,he spends his entire presidency trying to get impeached but for every ridiculous thing he does his approval rating skyrockets
television,not_removed,can only imagine the sorrow and anguish matt trey would go through writing garrisons victory speech but then i can imagine the oh jeez to end all oh jeezs theyve kind of brilliantly set up garrisons arc in case trump really does win
television,not_removed,op being optimistic and hoping garrison would be prez for only seasons instead of
television,not_removed,i think itd be funny if he became president but also got his job back being the kids teacher having the secret service and all that around the school would make for some interesting plots especially cartman if they dont keep his arc from this season
television,not_removed,mr hat can be vice president and mr slave can be head of the defense department and in control of the nukes
television,not_removed,oh gawd dammit geeeeeez
television,not_removed,i still dont buy cartman as a nice guy nope inside job roswell roswell
television,not_removed,you should see what happened with their show thats my bush
television,not_removed,oh jeeeeez
television,not_removed,the simpsons should do the same thing with mr burns wouldnt hurt the show at this point to do more experimental things
television,not_removed,you mean the next eight seasons
television,not_removed,ohhhh geeeeeeezzzzz
television,not_removed,they already gave away who the president is going to be kaitlyn jenner shes a woman and a reality tv star why choose one over the other when you can have both which means garrison wins and resigns maybe
television,not_removed,and if hilary wins they should let kyles mom be president for the next seasons
television,not_removed,jyeeeeez
television,not_removed,buckle up buckaroo
television,not_removed,hillary and saddam can try and take over hell together
television,not_removed,how is the election going i havent seen fucking anything on rnews about polls or predictions
television,not_removed,okay seems like im out of touch with south park didnt mr garrison sex change to female and insist everyone call him mrs garrison did she change back or something in the past few seasons
television,not_removed,so in a way some americans would be voting for a president as well as for what they want to see happen in their favourite cartoon i can see no problems associated with this at all
television,not_removed,hell end up getting assassinated
television,not_removed,oh geez
television,not_removed,oh jeeeezzz
television,not_removed,why why why did this get upvoted times thats literally what the plot of this season is
television,not_removed,the prophecy of the all mighty turd sandwich vs giant douche election of strikes again
television,not_removed,buckle up buckaroos
television,not_removed,im your president now and im gonna build a mother fucking wall sorry not sorry that was newly elected president garrison giving in innaugural speech i think if anything bill it is a departure from the usual style we have witnessed over the years thats right john direct and to the point this is why he was elected john and its refreshing to see a politician not completely abandon their base and i can only call it as it is sticking to their guns absolutely bill lets go to the budweiser scoreboard and see how this newly elected president took office
television,not_removed,you mean right
television,not_removed,on a side note god damn im sick of those member berries enough of that unfunny crap
television,not_removed,do people just watch south park anymore to see if trey and matt make fun of something the way they were hoping im so tired of posts like this like who cares what some people think they should do they will do whatever is relevant and funny as always
television,not_removed,wait i thought trump had a chance to get the republican nomination what happened gais
television,not_removed,no they should start actually making jokes again and get off their subpar story arch writing
television,not_removed,i was thinking earlier today that the us election with the latest fbi involvement was so crazy that the us election makes south park look tame
television,not_removed,if that happens they well canadians have to build a wall to keep you americans out guy
television,not_removed,not if when
television,not_removed,if trump wins i dont make usd on a bet so dont let me down people
television,not_removed,buckle up buckaroos
television,not_removed,jeeeessusss
television,not_removed,they wont have to write any material for four years
television,not_removed,member star wars
television,not_removed,do you remember they did in
television,not_removed,member when tokens life mattered
television,not_removed,im awaiting the post election episode with lots of anticipation the obamamckain ocean episode was a gem
television,not_removed,what do you think mr hat
television,not_removed,you may have just given a whole bunch of people a new reason to vote for him lol
television,not_removed,next two seasons thats how long it will take for the us to completely implode
television,not_removed,member when murica was great oh member
television,not_removed,no they would be bored as hell with that
television,not_removed,it wouldnt work trump will be tweeting at that he doesnt like it and hell make an executive order to cancel the show
television,not_removed,stating your own thoughts as comedy gold is more like comedy aluminum also it would be funnier just to have trump be the president why the need to fill in that roll
television,not_removed,do you guys hate trump that much
television,not_removed,im pretty sure matt and trey would end up in gitmo if trump got elected
television,not_removed,if thats not a good enough reason to vote trump than idk what is
television,not_removed,if hillary wins south park could have satan be president for the next four
television,not_removed,fuck no the whole continuity thing is killing south park the jokes have been driven into the ground and episodes are getting boring and predictable i wish this trend would hurry up and die
television,not_removed,its very optimistic to think wed be alive four years after donald trump was elected president
television,not_removed,if trump wins the joke will stop being funny all jokes will stop being funny
television,not_removed,im so sick of this election not because of clinton or trump but because even with the two most disliked and distrusted candidates in history people in the us are still convinced not to vote third party still wont get involved in the primary process participatedand still thinks not voting is smart when it doesnt accomplish anything but satisfying someones smug sense of rebellion my brother and sister americans have proven that theyre only interested in political drama and not the challenges and sometimes apocalyptic issues facing the world climate change why bother with the apocalypse when its just so darn entertaining to listen to trumps diarrhea mouth or satisfying your outrage over an obvious corrupt clinton obvious if you paid attention to the primaries feelthebern we failed again brothers and sisters on november americans will once again vote their fears
television,not_removed,thatd be hilarious almist as funny as hillary clinton being our actual president
television,not_removed,member when mr garrison was just the gay teacher member mr slave
television,not_removed,its a nice idea but it doesnt matter because donald trump is not winning the election
television,not_removed,except itll probably be mattn trey in guantanamo bay
television,not_removed,member when they took on all of clintons recent scandals no i dont member that one either
television,not_removed,theyd have to garrison already fucked the real trump to death
television,not_removed,and every time they cut to him in the white house hes fucking another mexican to death with a chalk board tally that gets larger each time
television,not_removed,at the end of election day mr garrison is watching the tv and at the end of the day says you fucking idiots
television,not_removed,member when mr garrison was mrs garrison
television,not_removed,good luck writing them from trump deeducation camps
television,not_removed,this is a great idea but i cant help but think we wont make it that far if thats the case reminds me of the episode when obama was elected when they all hid in the cave except we may actually need to hide in a cave this time
television,not_removed,im a hard core donald supporter and i would love this
television,not_removed,dont agree huge south park fan but i genuinely feel like mr garrisons charcter is one of the least funny characters on the show
television,not_removed,im kinda wondering if this latest dark week is standing do they can make both possible outcomes into episodes i know they only did the obama versions the last couple of times because they were sure he was gonna win but this time looks more like a crazy crap shoot than anything else
television,not_removed,the sad part is they cant do something similar if hillary becomes president shell be in prison
television,not_removed,nope the show needs to back to not having a multi episode storyline and instead write episodes that parody current events without just being a literal mockery like for example back when the election was giant douche vs turd sandwich they kept it topical without it ever mentioning bush or gore now this time its hillary and garrison trump and its not nearly as funny
television,not_removed,trumps looking pretty good right now and thats not counting all of the first time voters and voters who dont usually vote
television,not_removed,i think that was probably the idea
television,not_removed,i still dont get why they used garrison when they could have made another new cool character like pc principal instead
television,not_removed,hey should also do this if hilary wins i just want to see garrison be president
television,not_removed,it is a stupid idea
television,not_removed,i think randy marsh would have made a better trump than mr garrison
television,not_removed,i mean they have to
television,not_removed,almost like they planned that
television,not_removed,jeez
television,not_removed,he should be either way they seem to not care if things are canon
television,not_removed,the way the plot is going if he wins hell probably be replaced somehow by jenner
television,not_removed,trump isnt going to win the presidency hell probably win the popular vote that award and a few bucks will net him a cup of coffee hillary will win the ec and the presidency or itll be some congressional vote which will be bought and paid for and go to hillary southpark president should still be mr garrison lol
television,not_removed,when
television,not_removed,what about eric will he always behave like this i want old eric back
television,not_removed,i doubt they wi have four more seasons theyre tired of south park fair enough after plus seasons but it shows
television,not_removed,if hillary is elected they should have the devil play the role
television,not_removed,cartman would be much more fitting mr garrison would make a good hillary though
television,not_removed,maybe it will all be a dream
television,not_removed,and if hillary wins they should have mrs garrison be president
television,not_removed,btw when he was running away from the crowd was that the first time someone on south park moved his legs while running
television,not_removed,buckle up buckaroos
television,not_removed,ooowhl geeehzzzz
television,not_removed,you think dats baaaad remember da time
television,not_removed,the possibility of this happening has turned out to be the deciding factor for my presidential vote
television,not_removed,pretty sure trey and matt shouldnt stay in the us if trump is elected potus
television,not_removed,so they want trump to win this may actually really generate votes
television,not_removed,way to beat the member joke to its death for karma reddit
television,not_removed,so people are saying its possible now yeah must be the latest scoop on hillary
television,not_removed,that wouldnt get tiresome at all
television,not_removed,member jawas
television,not_removed,showerthoughts
television,not_removed,oh geeeez
television,not_removed,or they could replace him with the real donald since garrison doesnt seem to want to do it anymore they might go with some who looks like him
television,not_removed,and get assassinated
television,not_removed,welp now i know who to vote for
television,not_removed,eeeh i think the election stuff has been one of the weaker parts of the season smoking standup scene aside i mean its not bad but its not a joke funny enough to hold on to for four seasons
television,not_removed,why mrgarrison i think mrhankey would be a better president
television,not_removed,and if hillary gets elected it should be ms chokesondick comedy gold for sure on the flip side
television,not_removed,jj abrams for president
television,not_removed,oh geez
television,not_removed,since netflix seems like one big memberberry they should also have the memberberries take over netflix does anyone see a patallel between every troll and cartman wanting to erase their internet histories and memberberries remembering everything
television,not_removed,okay but only if pc principal is vp
television,not_removed,gets larger each time
television,not_removed,id assume garrison would lose the election to donald trump if trump won the election do a cutout animation of trump just like saddam
television,not_removed,i feel like they are way ahead of you on this one
television,not_removed,buckle up buckaroos
television,not_removed,serious question cause i havent watched south park in a while is it mr garrison again or ms
television,not_removed,well at least he will finally get rid of all the mexicans
television,not_removed,oh jesus tap dancing christ
television,not_removed,said everyone in rsouthpark months ago
television,not_removed,pretty sure thats what theyre doing
television,not_removed,o geez
television,not_removed,maybe they should do that anyway
television,not_removed,i thought thats where they were going with this
television,not_removed,assuming therell be more years due to nuclear war
television,not_removed,and what if hillary wins
television,not_removed,you mean toliet water
television,not_removed,aww man when i was younger i wasnt allowed to watch south park but recently ive been binge watching to catch up im currently on season cant wait to see what they do regarding the us elections
television,not_removed,you mean
television,not_removed,if trump wins we will have mr garrison as president for years
television,not_removed,ending south park would be the most epic move i mean at that point south park has become a reality
television,not_removed,you mean eight
television,not_removed,lets let south park do the writing they seem to know whats best
television,not_removed,this is enough to get me to vote trump
television,not_removed,buckle up buckaroo
television,not_removed,if donald trump becomes president america should kill itself
television,not_removed,the show would write itself mr garrison could exactly copy ahem president trumps actions
television,not_removed,is there even going to be four more seasons
television,not_removed,seasons whole seasons
television,not_removed,but then their wont be anyone left in the country to watch south park
television,not_removed,as soon as trump wins theyll drop it immediately they used to be the guys that never took a stance on anything but thats changed lately after trump wins theyll be butthurt and mr garrison will be a teacher again
television,not_removed,considering both candidates are giant piles of shit this might just sway me enough to vote for one of them id love some president garrison
television,not_removed,i always thought when trump wins they will have to find a replacement person who is as american as you can get so they have this medicine they make presumably with the member berries and test it on a canadian body so they can see if it turns them american and they test it on the corpse of canadian trump
television,not_removed,this is the only thing that makes the idea of him being president tolerable everything goes to shit but south park has the funniest four seasons its ever had
television,not_removed,he had to become president for the rebirth of saturday night live edit this is the only thing that has me going to vote
television,not_removed,can someone explain why they chose to use mr garrison as a representation of trump but hillary has her own character
television,not_removed,no shit sherlock
television,not_removed,i wish sp would go back to their old format this new style is starting to wear on me
television,not_removed,unless its eight seasons
television,not_removed,aw geez
television,not_removed,they already did that
television,not_removed,he can appoint mr slave as his secretary of state
television,not_removed,ah thanks i hadnt seen it
television,not_removed,fail to the chief
television,not_removed,
television,not_removed,i think itd be funnier if he actually tries to be a really great president but the rest of the government the press and especially the general public keep screwing everything up
television,not_removed,i think they should have him win regardless of who wins the real election even though its unlikely they would it would provide them a good way to satirize politicsinternational affairs regularly garrison has kind of been a stale character the last few seasons this definitely gives him a stronger purpose and makes a more interesting character hes already freaking out over being president but actually becoming him and doing it will be so much more interesting than hillary winning in the show the classic government secrets the president learns upon inauguration trope could be used in full effect for a variety of situations
television,not_removed,can only imagine the sorrow and anguish matt trey would go through writing garrisons victory speech im sure they already have it written they likely have two versions of the episode ready to go maybe
television,not_removed,its not like theyd be thrilled if hillary won pretty sure theyve accepted whatever bullshit were gonna get
television,not_removed,goddamn you
television,not_removed,dont you mean forever
television,not_removed,gayfishhobbit
television,not_removed,yeezy
television,not_removed,i think you mean pessimistic
television,not_removed,caitlyn jenner is already his vp i can only imagine her piloting air force one
television,not_removed,control of nukes or control of the snuke
television,not_removed,except mr hat and mr slave havent been relevant in ages so why would they be catlin jenner would be the one buckle up buckaroo
television,not_removed,plot twist turd sandwich is mr hat
television,not_removed,i completely forgot about mr hat
television,not_removed,but mr hats in hell and didnt slave marry al
television,not_removed,yeeessss
television,not_removed,what about mr twig
television,not_removed,trump did say he wants to use nukes on terrorists what could possibly go wrong
television,not_removed,mr slave should be the united states secretary of health and human services
television,not_removed,deleted
television,not_removed,cartman is gonna end up destroying trolltracecom because hes afraid heidi will find out he said girls ruined ghostbusters
television,not_removed,i do he got to see the vagina balls hes all in now
television,not_removed,killed thatand it wasnt a huge hit like sp
television,not_removed,they actually wanted a show about gore and started planning it before the election was over because they were sure he was going to win
television,not_removed,but mitt romney isnt running this year
television,not_removed,kyles mom is a big fat bitch shes the biggest bitch in the whole wide world
television,not_removed,heyyyyyy relax guy
television,not_removed,hillarys poll numbers have been declining since the third debate but she is still leading by about points nationally a couple days ago fbi director james comey wrote a vague letter to congress saying that in the course of an unrelated investigation the fbi discovered more emails that appear to be pertinent to the investigation of her private email server right now were in the middle of the ensuing shithurricane with only days until the election
television,not_removed,nothing but biased polls and pollsters throwing out data based on who they want to win even with brexit pollsters fucking suck this year
television,not_removed,only gives hrc an percent chance of winning not even joking the dems are horrified
television,not_removed,at this pointfuck it
television,not_removed,you are probably on some kind of list now fyi
television,not_removed,im pretty sure people have said that about every presidential elect since kennedy
television,not_removed,people said the same about obama spoiler he wasnt
television,not_removed,trump or garrison
television,not_removed,people feared the same for obama and it never happened if trump is ever assassinated there would be a real chance of it being an inside job
television,not_removed,most of the people who hate him enough to want to kill him seem to hate pence even more for example pence wanted to send aidshiv care money to gay conversion camps that use shock therapy on minors hes practically an antiassassination shield
television,not_removed,he has the best assassins nobody gets assassinated like him nobody
television,not_removed,crab people
television,not_removed,not really a prophecy since it describes most of the elections of the last years or so
television,not_removed,and reporting live from the inauguration is a midget in a bikini thanks tom
television,not_removed,im waiting for a pay off on the storyline
television,not_removed,deleted
television,not_removed,i thought they were pretty fucking funny the first two episodes but they became boring fast
television,not_removed,i was looking for this double eps were nice now and then but its turned into a slow meandering storyline with gags sprinkled around kinda like big bang theory
television,not_removed,i dont even get them ive only seen a couple episodes so fill me in someone
television,not_removed,jeb bush was so boring it made everyones brain go on stand by then ted cruzs dad went and murderer jfk
television,not_removed,i for one am eagerly awaiting new episodes for the first time ever its been these last three or so seasons where theyve really gotten into doing season long social commentary arcs that ive really gotten hooked before that i just watched the occasional episode i didnt care to see them all or watch them in order the way i do now
television,not_removed,i stopped watching south park for the first time this year so tired of seeing the same shit for going on seasons now member when each episode was different and a episode story was special
television,not_removed,yeah i think the arc worked fine in season randy lorde was a fun concept they could play with every week that built up to a strong finale while allowing them to do funny and mostly contained episodes like cock magic and freemium isnt free and and especially got way too convoluted there hasnt been a true oneoff at all this year the member berries are funny cartmans rebirth has been pretty funny pc principle was funny but it ends up making every episode feel repitive because of the jokes are the same concept
television,not_removed,ive watched every season loved last season but this one i stopped watching after a couple of episodes i dont think i care whether or not they have a story line simply put its not funny
television,not_removed,holy shit thank you i honestly thought i was so alone in thinking these story arc seasons are just selfindulgent unfunny garbage
television,not_removed,i think part of the problem is that after so many seasons its very hard to keep telling interesting and unique stories their episode simpsons did it aired years ago just imagine how hard it is to think things up now i would quite like a one off episode now and again but i can see that they decided to change the format to longer form stories to do something unique if they hadnt then everyone would be complaining about how they were stale and just like the simpsons its not the same show as the one that first aired many many years ago but it is still interesting still unique and still worth watching
television,not_removed,im ok with them experimenting a season or two of story arcs is fine but yeah i like week by week better i dont know if theyre still taking six days to do episodes but that felt authentic to me as opposed to the continuity
television,not_removed,youll probably get downvoted but i agree ive watched episodes so far of the season and cant remember even chuckling once in the last episodes cool story bro but not really funny
television,not_removed,this season has been pretty shitty last season and the season before that were great but this season is just boring the only funny thing would be the member berries but its old now the one sided trump jokes were dead on arrival
television,not_removed,rjokes misses you and your levity
television,not_removed,oh i member
television,not_removed,because trump has been portrayed by garrison for the past seasons
television,not_removed,probably not
television,not_removed,give the people what we want good television
television,not_removed,katy perry will show her tits if hillary wins
television,not_removed,member when south park had stand alone episodes
television,not_removed,hillarys dealings are too disgusting to put on tv though
television,not_removed,im for clinton more so against trump but this new fbi release isnt looking good for her wether or not she did wrong what matters is if the voters do since the fbis release fivethirtyeight has trump up to from and he is still climbing granted nyt still gives hillary a but among polls the biggest issue with hillary is trust issues and among likely clinton voters the biggest reason is that she is comparitvly better when you have a voter base that votes for you based on not wanting another you play a dangerous game with apathy if trump looks marginally better compared to hillary than before she stands to lose a lot of votes
television,not_removed,they should be doing that next episode after the election
television,not_removed,that was canadian trump
television,not_removed,scissormetimbers
television,not_removed,i loved mr garrison before he became trump he was the most racist hateful character besides cartman which made it ironic because of his sex change and homosexuality
television,not_removed,need more randy
television,not_removed,imo garrison seems to be better on episodes that arent garrisonfocused you dont see that as often now since hes not teaching the boys but his little classroom jokes with how weird his teaching material was made me laugh
television,not_removed,well not quite a crap shoot hillary is definitely the favorite right now trumps got a shot but it would have to mean that a bunch of different things all come together in his favor
television,not_removed,he has said that he may quit if he doesnt like it
television,not_removed,probably because unlike in this election bush and gore were both viable presidents
television,not_removed,how is trump looking pretty good
television,not_removed,evidently you havent been following the shows current season mr garrison is standing in for trump in the presidential race against clinton
television,not_removed,im sure cc just throws money at them everytime they want to retire
television,not_removed,thats perfect they could have mrgarrison do all the dumb stuff trump does in real life and then have cartoon trump make fun of how dumb it is cartoon irony gold
television,not_removed,but mr hankey is black
television,not_removed,enjoy one of the wittiest things on television
television,not_removed,this hasnt failed to make me bust a gut yet everytime is delivered perfectly
television,not_removed,slowly gets deeper everything to the point of inaudible moans
television,not_removed,buckle up buckaroo
television,not_removed,do it again
television,not_removed,i member
television,not_removed,simpsons did it
television,not_removed,brewsters millions
television,not_removed,which episode was it pls
television,not_removed,sorry but i dont get it when where and who
television,not_removed,do it again
television,not_removed,they dont speak anymore
television,not_removed,nah should go like this season opens garrison and jenner won and are moving into the white house as theyre unpacking in the white house its revealed they got married to be the first president and vp to be married things go well but towards the end theres a sinister tone and jenner is saying some really messed up stuff like how he should start sending muslims and gays to camps then at the end of the episode they show then unpacking the last bag and as garrison gets called away on presidential business jenner reaches into her bag and pulls out her hand and revealsmr hat
television,not_removed,oh jesus christ
television,not_removed,presidents assistant or for short presidents ass
television,not_removed,garrison is that friend who keeps going to rehab and relapsing in increasingly hilarious ways
television,not_removed,obviously he would need another sex change too so that they would have a way to satirize all the upcoming sexpresidist comments to be you know there will be some good ones
television,not_removed,the classic government secrets the president learns upon inauguration trope could be used in full effect for a variety of situations dont the boys stumble over all of these regularly anyway
television,not_removed,buckle up buckaroo
television,not_removed,the entire four or eight years he could be known as president douche i hope they never use the names garrison or trump then they could have hillary video footage pop back in at random times with local news lettering below her image spelling out a turd sandwich and have her blurt out some equally crazy suggestion or criticism of course it would work the other way around but it wouldnt sound quite as funny the possibilities are endless
television,not_removed,actually for the obama election results episode against mccain they only prepared the one episode as opposed to also making an episode if mccain won source httpsenmwikipediaorgwikiaboutlastnightsouthpark i think i also read somewhere that they just take their best guess and air that because its already so labor intensive with their schedule
television,not_removed,im guessing they hate hilldawg about as much as they hate trump probably but still most of garrisons dialogue from this season makes it seems like matt and trey would much rather have hillary in the white house than trump garrisons big speech coming clean during the debates the fact of the matter is i should not be president okay i will fuck this country up beyond repair i am a sick angry little man please if you care at all about the future of our country vote for her okay shes the one who at least has some experience shes not as bad as you think i promise and unlike me she is actually capable of running this country matt and trey and most of us know that we are truly stuck between a giant douche and a turd sandwich it would be great if we could bring in some third party candidate it would be great to have other options but thats just not how it is right now its way too late in the game for that if we were going to bring a third party candidate up to the same level as the twoparty leaders it should have been done during the primaries for now at least we have to choose between the giant douche and the turd sandwich we will be stuck with one of them there is no getting out of that now so which will do the least damage which is the lesser evil i think thats what matt and trey are trying to emphasize this season turd sandwich sucks and hardly anybody likes her but giant douche may literally fuck up the country beyond repair
television,not_removed,maybe mark cuban likes hilary more and im pretty sure hes a libertarian
television,not_removed,trey said i hate conservatives but i really fucking hate liberals
television,not_removed,they clearly hate trump much more
television,not_removed,i believe they both stated last year that they no longer connect to any party they are all terrible
television,not_removed,bruh theyre overtly using the garrison arc to outright tell people to vote for hillary no way they hate them equally they know at least hillary would be the relatively responsible choice
television,not_removed,they had garrison directly telling the viewer to vote for clinton who they want to win is pretty clear
television,not_removed,ivanka
television,not_removed,my prediction is that he is going to either get his girlfriend to kill herself or make her become a complete sociopath
television,not_removed,buckle up buckaroos
television,not_removed,do you think caitlyn jenner would be relevant that long andor the joke would last that long
television,not_removed,ohh jeeeez
television,not_removed,nah hillary has the snuke hidden in her snizz
television,not_removed,oh jesus christ
television,not_removed,they can make mr hat and mr slave great again
television,not_removed,ooooooo i member
television,not_removed,or mr hat can be her running mate
television,not_removed,oh i member mr hat
television,not_removed,i member big gay al
television,not_removed,shes just such a turd sandwich
television,not_removed,i think that heidi is playing the long con to get back at cartman for not loving the new ghostbuster
television,not_removed,it originally was going to be about al gore
television,not_removed,its too bad too because i thought it was hilarious
television,not_removed,simpsons did it
television,not_removed,anyone got a clip
television,not_removed,shes a stupid bitch if there ever was a bitch shes a bitch to all the boys and girls
television,not_removed,lalelala lalelala lalelalalaaa
television,not_removed,haha right her and hilary are like twins
television,not_removed,looks like people didnt get your reference
television,not_removed,and prom is tomorrow
television,not_removed,to be fair they can only measure people stupid enough to answer polls
television,not_removed,only
television,not_removed,you know what uyeticabra yeah you know what youre on the list
television,not_removed,dnc list probably
television,not_removed,yeah trumps list of people hes gonna sue
television,not_removed,yeah the list of people banned from thedonald edit what i meant is that that subreddit has an instant ban if you mention the assassination of theirs truly
television,not_removed,you know what uyeticabra you just made the list
television,not_removed,if he gets assassinated now before his term is up im blaming you
television,not_removed,yeah but at least one political party liked obama
television,not_removed,well i mean theres still time
television,not_removed,garrison already murdered trump so i dont believe they would make garrison president for a long time they can probably return to using a duck that craps out of its mouth like they had years ago
television,not_removed,yes
television,not_removed,this suddenly makes me very curious as to how many attempted assassinations happen and we dont know
television,not_removed,oh my god that would totally explain why he chose him as vp maybe he really is playing chess
television,not_removed,he also signed a bill that made it a felony for a samesex couple to even apply for a marriage license
television,not_removed,yeah youd have to go full on john wilkesbooth plot level and try to take out the vp too which failed as did his coconspirators attempt to kill the secretary of state
television,not_removed,the kkk might as well be worried about sasquatch
television,not_removed,they are all drinking the member berries they are evil little shits that are going to take over everything control people
television,not_removed,i still think the show is funny but if they keep doing these season long stories then im gonna wait until the season is done before watching
television,not_removed,honestly youre so right its like the whole season going towards making a single joke sometime in the future where are the laughs now mate
television,not_removed,jj abrams mind control fruit
television,not_removed,its making fun of how people nowadays are nostalgic its like a storyline based on rlewronggeneration
television,not_removed,he was just so low energy i hate ted cruz but the guy has argued in front of the supreme court times he knows his shit those are the kind of people i want to see running for the presidency i might not agree with the conclusions they come to but their competence is above repute
television,not_removed,and the democrats nominated a female gimmick candidate who happens to be a corrupt criminal if you stupid feminists and liberal fuckheads had just nominated sanders and not taken the bribes and relished in this queen of versailles esque corruption you wouldnt all be complaining would you
television,not_removed,im the same way i like it a lot
television,not_removed,last season was pretty convoluted if i remember right too it was all about pc then at the end everyone was an ad idk but i thought it shined with different episodes everytime i will probably watch it eventually but i honestly have no interest in seeing where this story line goes
television,not_removed,i like the member berries
television,not_removed,oh i havent watched the show in a long time didnt know they did that they usually just throw the celebrity in there
television,not_removed,theyre good businessmen and he respects that
television,not_removed,this joke was never funny
television,not_removed,scissor me xerxes
television,not_removed,can we get rid of the mexicans no mr garrison we cant get rid of the mexicans
television,not_removed,
television,not_removed,feet higher
television,not_removed,i member
television,not_removed,do you realize that most probably mispronounced your username prob something like yoo zer n no wait yoo ber name wait that says oooo ber name
television,not_removed,he will be the wile e coyote for a generation of degenerate millennials who already do nothing but send dick pics and try to put things in each others butts
television,not_removed,member chewbacca
television,not_removed,which episode pls
television,not_removed,is umikeboylan talking about the death camp of tolerance
television,not_removed,jethuth critht
television,not_removed,foreign secretary then
television,not_removed,kathie lee gifford becomes public enemy
television,not_removed,all the south park characters are but garrisons definitely in the top most screwed up
television,not_removed,the sex change thing is kinda played out i hope they wouldnt go with that again
television,not_removed,scissor me timbers
television,not_removed,to be fair there was really no reason to prepare an episode in case mccain won i mean we knew that months out
television,not_removed,fair point they might just be counting on a hillary victory and not worrying about it because its already so labor intensive im kinda thinking it would be the same just a few lines of voiceover switched and a few characters switched in animation
television,not_removed,and after that speech hillary says my opponent is a liar and cannot be trusted if anything in this scene he is presented as a human with flaws like everyone else while she is presented as a robotic politician just saying things that other people tell her to say
television,not_removed,it would be great if we could bring in some third party candidate it would be great to have other options but thats just not how it is right now its way too late in the game for that if we were going to bring a third party candidate up to the same level as the twoparty leaders it should have been done during the primaries the us needs a social movement started to change the election rules or you are gonna end up in the exact same scenario in a couple of years again the voting system is not something you change over a couple of months during the primaries especially not when the established players have so much to gain from keeping the status quo you need a partyindependent large social movement to change that unfortunately i expect us voters to forget rather quickly their anguish at having to choose between a turd sandwich and a giant douche after the voting is done and the furore will be forgotten until the next election
television,not_removed,it would be great if we could bring in some third party candidate im am pretty sure you can vote johnson libertarian or stein green
television,not_removed,from what ive heard hillary is rather far to the right for a democrat
television,not_removed,i go to egypt
television,not_removed,that year old quote has nothing to do with their specific feelings about trump who they clearly despise they said they didnt even want to mention his name this season because they didnt want to give him the satisfaction that speech garrison gave to the screen saying please vote for her she isnt that bad she at least knows how government works was pretty obviously framed to the viewer
television,not_removed,trey said i hate conservatives but i really fucking hate liberals i too would hate the assholes i have to vote for so the other assholes dont come to power more then the ones im keeping away fucking lizards
television,not_removed,possibly but i think its just easier to write jokes based off trump theres a lot of material they can use surrounding him like theyve demonstrated in the current season of south park hillary is just a politican trump has a massive history i mean just watch some of his howard stern interviews he is a character that is so much easier to write for
television,not_removed,and they had garrison literally fuck trump to death last year
television,not_removed,they had garrison telling that clinton should win and then went to make clinton look like a robot who can only say what was written for her
television,not_removed,i think its their first ever endorsement too
television,not_removed,baron
television,not_removed,that would be amazing she is the role model for many young girls and is very smart
television,not_removed,i really hope she becomes a sociopath so the girls have a cartmanesque character of their own to deal with
television,not_removed,ooohhhh jeeeeeeeeez
television,not_removed,please south park made relevant again whether she is or is not relevant makes no different to south park at least thats what brain boitanod do its become such a part of my life boitano remarked in a interview with the san francisco chronicle kids who dont know who i am or what i did at the olympics meet me and think im cool because im in south park

television,not_removed,ya i member it it was really surreal for the time member tv funhouse that come on after i think that show was bonkers
television,not_removed,i dont think they are talking about this but if they are its at sec forward
television,not_removed,shes a big fat bitch and she has stupid hair shes a bitch bitch bitch bitch bitch bitch bitch
television,not_removed,this is even funnier now that i know matt and trey named stan and kyles parents after their own

television,not_removed,a theoretically infinite number
television,not_removed,what was john wilkesbooths political alignment was he just an antiabolitionist or what
television,not_removed,might as well be worried about sasquatch worried about sasquatch sasquatch uterminimals coffee cup falls from his hand slowmo shattering on the floor his pupils dilate as a series of images flash through his consciousness—pattersongimlin zapruder access hollywood— he moves to the cork bulletin board tearing off a photograph and finds a familiar face far in the back of the large crowd between the limousine and the building my god all this time he dials a number with trembling fingers macallan damnit macallan pick up the phone it was him all along macallan your life is in danger you need to get out of that forest now
television,not_removed,what do you know
television,not_removed,whats a sasquatch is it like a manbearpig
television,not_removed,that makes a ton more sense thanks
television,not_removed,great point
television,not_removed,thanks
television,not_removed,he was just so low energy yeah he should have yeeehhhaaaaad moar member when that sort of behaviour lost you any chance at a nomination
television,not_removed,who happens to be a corrupt criminal so a politician if you stupid feminists and liberal fuckheads had just nominated sanders and not taken the bribes and relished in this queen of versaillesesque corruption you wouldnt all be complaining would you you forgot to call liberals cucks adn im sure if sanders got the nomination yall im only voting for trump coz hes antiestablishment types wouldnt be screaming socialist at all and damn those where some lucky million people getting bribed to vote hillary
television,not_removed,that season ended with the entire town literally hanging reality from the gallows
television,not_removed,im not big on the election plot thread but i do like the gerald one last weeks episode was particularly strong and i really like the kids one seeing cartman like this is totally out there usually its easy to predict how sincere he is barely ever but i havent a clue what to expect at the end of the season for him
television,not_removed,the member berries was really funny for like episode now later and theyre still there i feel like they could have made each of the overarching story lines member berries boys v girls trolls v norway etc into one single episode and have small bits and pieces of the presidency thing scattered throughout the season with an episode after the president is elected
television,not_removed,yeah fuck em all to death
television,not_removed,member how they dont ever die
television,not_removed,and me too

television,not_removed,gee did you pick that up from the episode where he demands to know why his father didnt sexually abuse him and wasnt he good enough
television,not_removed,honestly the caitlyn jenner thing is already played out i feel like it made a lot of sense at the time but they really painted themselves into a corner by giving her the vp slot trumps relevance was longlasting jenners lets just say that when she appeared at the end of the last episode it took me a minute to remember who she actually was like why jenner
television,not_removed,as soon as sarah palin opened her mouth as the vp nominee that gosh darn ship had sailed
television,not_removed,i saw a different joke that although she is a better candidate hilarys campaign has been so shit that even if she was running against someone who wanted her to win shes still fuck it up
television,not_removed,you can but they are both idiots in their own ways
television,not_removed,you can but it doesnt mean much in our first past the post system at this point it amounts to the same as a writein
television,not_removed,i love them so hard
television,not_removed,they did dig at clinton but it was childs play compared to them hating trump so much they refuse to use his name
television,not_removed,lets correct that only being able to say what was written for her by the people who we assume are her advisors
television,not_removed,joe please dont call me joe joe miller miller miller ftfy

television,not_removed,oh jeeeezzzz
television,not_removed,wow i actually forgot that was heidi i can basically recite every episode and that part slipped my mind maybe shes playing the long con to get him to shit in front of the world or something
television,not_removed,its way worse than pete melman was way worse
television,not_removed,i believe its called the law of large numbers
television,not_removed,the show has just been on long enough that its now in sort of an infinite monkeys on infinite typewriters situation
television,not_removed,they have a time traveler working full time
television,not_removed,well for this specific instance trump has been taking about running for president for decades he has also been excentric arrogant loudmouth billionaire for decades in the eye of the public
television,not_removed,statistical probability
television,not_removed,kyles moms a bitch shes a really mean old bitch
television,not_removed,deleted
television,not_removed,the crossover rate between wrestling fans and south park fans is pretty high
television,not_removed,theoretically an arbitrarily large finite number
television,not_removed,a couple days before the assassination he attended a speech at the white house at which lincoln promised to grant suffrage to former slaves which he was quoted as essentially cementing booths will to attempt the plot this was also only two days after the surrender of robert e lees army of northern virginia at the battle of appomattox court house so the war was still technically ongoing general joseph e johnstons army of the south didnt surrender until later in april its also worth noting that general ulysses s grant and his wife were also invited to accompany president and mrs lincoln to fords theatre that night but declined the goal of the plot was to decapitate the us government and throw it into such a state of confusion that the confederacy would be able to reorganize and mount some sort of resistance ending in something other than unconditional surrender or failing that to simply avenge the loss of the war
television,not_removed,dammit macallan pick up the damn phone
television,not_removed,that was actually in the middle of the season it ended with whole foods going back into space where it came from
television,not_removed,hmm i remember being confused about the ending which is the first time ive ever been confused by a south park episode felt like things happened in the end
television,not_removed,in your campaign you said that you would deal with our countrys immigrants and enemies by personally fucking them all to death by our estimates its roughly million people you have promised to fuck to death in your first year of office
television,not_removed,did that now what

television,not_removed,for me it was when he shoved poor lemmiwinks into mr slaves anus only for the gerbil to go on a quest filled with the ghosts of animals who were previously shoved up mr slaves ass as guides to help lemmiwinks crawl his way all the way through mr slaves digestive tract escaping out of mr slaves mouth
television,not_removed,haha what episode was that
television,not_removed,good list but cartman is solidly for me
television,not_removed,gerald was also a total pro at cheesing back in the day
television,not_removed,member when gerald was a dolphin
television,not_removed,dont forget randy hes the poster dad for raging alcoholic disappointment father and cartmans mom has been in crack whore magazine which her son knows about and seriously what does she do for a job unless i missed the episode
television,not_removed,any list that doesnt have randy at number one is just plain wrong
television,not_removed,no love for randy that dude is seriously fucked up
television,not_removed,member when gerald became a dolphin
television,not_removed,i think there is still hilarity in caitlyn jenner describing herself as a traditional woman
television,not_removed,its funny family guy was making jokes about himher way before heshe transitioned currently watching old episodes on netflix and the jokes about bill clinton being a perv are very frequent
television,not_removed,i do lean conservative we pick the shittiest candidates every years like clockwork i find myself staring in disbelief thinking is this the best we can do thing is about trump hillary is beatable hillary has always been beatable we should be walking all over hillary yet here we are a week to go and the election is so neck and neck i cant even call it trump is another shitty candidate
television,not_removed,first time watching it that was my thought as well but when i think about it now it was interesting how sincere they made garrison sound if you didnt look at them like trump and hillary but just characters part of south park garrison was more likable for lack of a better word in that scene
television,not_removed,thats mostly because trump is a lot easier to make fun off i think
television,not_removed,i think they are building up a slow dig at clinton with the whole trolltracecom podesta thing about releasing all the emails
television,not_removed,with deman as vp
television,not_removed,he has said it more in passing in previous seasons they seem to be emphasizing it in this season
television,not_removed,im sure hed kick an ass or two

television,not_removed,simpsons did it
television,not_removed,well in this case its not completely random trump has been threatening to run for president and sometimes actually running since people have been satirizing his hypothetical presidency that whole time

television,not_removed,right here its my cue i used to work at an internet cafe surrounded by kids i was pretty much a teen myself and ive been going to that same cafe for years already the kids were mostly cs players ranging from the to the years old all of them a bunch of pricks and nerds and the owner was this longtime celibate —think of comic book guy from the simpsons but without the ponytail a couple of years ago there was a sting and and outcry because it turned out he had been grooming and abusing those kids for a long long while it only became public because he decided to stop paying them to fuck there was a kid he was giving six hundred bucks a month for gods sake and one of the kids suddenly having no money to spend in games and the like decided to tell and then i wondered why the hell didnt he try to fuck me was i not good enough was i not cutehot enough as far as i know the kiddie fuckers still in jail
television,not_removed,the south park epidsode was from always sunny in philadelphia didnt air its first season until
television,not_removed,south park did it httpsouthparkwikiacomwikiworldwiderecorderconcert
television,not_removed,right seriously what i was thinking
television,not_removed,take the magic helmet torch to help you light the way theres still a lot of ground to cross inside the man so gay
television,not_removed,hahaha haha made you eat your parents
television,not_removed,i dont think cartman is screwed up he just screws with other people
television,not_removed,chef is a brainwashed pedophile darth vader its really hard to be more screwed up then that
television,not_removed,a jewphin
television,not_removed,randy isnt drinking its a wine tasting and its classy
television,not_removed,i believe its implied she is a hooker
television,not_removed,dude randy gave himself cancer of the fuckin balls so he could get medical marijuana
television,not_removed,crack whore hooker is pretty messed up but in the grand scheme of south park not all that terrible randy is a solid contender though more so than gerald id say
television,not_removed,buckle up buckaroos
television,not_removed,people have been making fun of bruces looks for years it was a running joke that he was trying to turn into a woman on the soup years before he ever did
television,not_removed,this election is basically which party throws the election harder than the other had the republicans not gone with trump it could have been an easy win same with the democrats had they not chosen hillary now the race is somehow close because these are the two most disliked candidates in history
television,not_removed,uh if you think the election is neck and neck you are delusional
television,not_removed,the slow cosby
television,not_removed,well he has good reasons for that
television,not_removed,cause thats what brian boitanod do
television,not_removed,ive never seen a man eat so many chicken wings
television,not_removed,thats commander douchebag to you you elven scum
television,not_removed,and if you decide thats too much you could walk out the door and watch south park get nuked
television,not_removed,wow
television,not_removed,even back to the future
television,not_removed,member the villas at kennys house member mysterion member cockmagic member princess kenny kenny is getting plenty of story lines which youd member if you actually watched it not sure what more you expect from a character who we mostly cant understand member when heaven had a keanu reeves
television,not_removed,i member
television,not_removed,holy shit what the fuck i cant believe some people could do that
television,not_removed,i guess thats where sunny got their inspiration from
television,not_removed,kinda hard to top that
television,not_removed,he made scott eat his own parents
television,not_removed,ya its really hard but id say unknowingly feeding a kids parents to him over getting ripped off on some cash is the exact kind of hard work that gets you to the spot on the list
television,not_removed,its called a schmorgasvein and its elegantly cultural
television,not_removed,its not implied she is straight up seen smoking crack with a john before i think she is clean in the later seasons though
television,not_removed,what do you mean
television,not_removed,thats actually a pretty famous one though op probably knew about it
television,not_removed,member when people membered
television,not_removed,member chimpokomon member shoe
television,not_removed,he used to lure the kids in —as far as i know—with the huge amount of consoles and video games and anime shit he had at his place he took me there once before i worked for him but i just grabbed a couple of movies back when dvds werent around then in vhs and headed home
television,not_removed,wellthen he licked the tears off scotts face
television,not_removed,he also shot token and stuffed the entire disney world theme park up his ass he also froze himself so he could be thawed out and not have to wait for the nintendo wii
television,not_removed,didnt it turn out that scotts dad was also cartmans dad so he fed his own father to his half brother because of pubes
television,not_removed,tokens parents also spell it right out in here comes the neighbourhood something like im a successful lawyer and your friend eric cartmans mother is a crack whore one job pays a little bit more than the other
television,not_removed,anyone that has bothered looking at an electoral map knows there is exactly zero chance that trump wins
television,not_removed,ohhh i member
television,not_removed,he also ate all the chicken skin off the kfc before anyone else got any thats the best part
television,not_removed,i think hes matured now though really cares about things like gender equality
television,not_removed,and gave kyle aids
television,not_removed,didnt it turn out that scotts dad was also cartmans dad i dont member that
television,not_removed,xplay was hilarious in the early days eventually it lost a lot of its humor but still managed to be a really solid show about gaming news and reviews i also remember a show called cheats where each episode was based around a single game and the host showed how to beat certain areas or how to unlock items it was like youtube lets plays to an extent before those were a thing
television,not_removed,really loved attack of the show watched it all the time definitely one of my fave channels
television,not_removed,those moments between adam and morgan specifically the insane customs adam dons during x play and the weird looks he gets from morgan i miss x play
television,not_removed,xplay before they redid it i enjoyed cheat attack of the show early days
television,not_removed,any moments with olivia munn thrilled to see her in more and more stuff lately
television,not_removed,honestly everything i loved zdtv and there werent many outlets in mainstream media for geeks in the late and early i had just gotten out of the military about months after zdtv started on cable and hadnt watched much tv over the previous decade because i was rarely stationary long enough but here was this channel that catered to all of my interests it was pretty amazing i liked the personalities and the content as it grew and became it got even better imo sure there were people and shows that annoyed me but as a whole i was in love it actually made me sad when it was apparent that the channel was dying and then actually died sure i can get more content by subscribing to certain channels on youtube and even twit and its just not the same though to simply tune into a channel on tv and let it run all day and have all kinds of interesting content is what i really miss now im just hoping that auction and pawn shop shows and more cops reruns dont kill the history channeloh wait
television,not_removed,matt mira and john barrowman talk about the upcoming black friday deals
television,not_removed,this whole thing from pretty funny at the time
television,not_removed,there was a show called with laura foy and tina wood which was pretty awesome almost as good as xplay though wood and foy were more focused on the industry itself rather than individual games
television,not_removed,nobody mentioned arena
television,not_removed,i miss tech tv pre days much more
television,not_removed,
television,not_removed,i miss a portal and cheat
television,not_removed,i enjoyed watching screen savers in the mornings before i went to school
television,not_removed,a bit off topic but the attack of the show youtube channel got deleted recently
television,not_removed,i never understood the appeal of xplay attack of the show was my jam with kevin p and olivia pretty much forged my sense of humor as a kid watching that every night at
television,not_removed,arena the screensaversearly aots anime unleashed midnight spank xplay cheat filter with diane mizota cinematech it just showed videogame trailers electronic playground my favorite moment was staying up to watch this anime called colorful it was about guys just trying to see womens panties
television,not_removed,even though it had basic cable level production values it was great to watch something that covered internet and gaming culture in a genuine and positive way
television,not_removed,when adam and morgan hosted the bethesda preshow this year i almost started crying from nostalgia
television,not_removed,one of the fakest people i have ever seen on television she was hot though
television,not_removed,if hes as smart and honest as he seems hell figure out how fucked up his priorities were or hell slink into the dennis miller swamp and become irrelevant
television,not_removed,donald trump pulled off what is perhaps the single greatest political victory in the history of democracy stretching all the way back years to ancient athens
television,not_removed,where in his clip does he say anything that would indicate what his priorities are saying he doesnt feel bad for hilary doesnt mean he is endorsing anything trump does
television,not_removed,i take it you dont know much about burr hes a masshole comedian who just loves to rant about things in a usually negative light he is far from a political guy he just rants about everything and is a bit of a conspiracy theorist so politics come up hes a curmudgeon who admittedly says he doesnt know what hes talking about of the time dont take what he says seriously even though he is right in this clip
television,not_removed,are you talking about bill burr or the donald
television,not_removed,i dont think its so much that he won its that as a candidate
television,not_removed,nothing says political victory quite like losing the popular vote
television,not_removed,the on this comment just shows how maaaaaaaaaasively butthurt reddit still is you can hate trump and still recognize that as far as democratic elections go this equivalent to the biggest sports upset in history
television,not_removed,look up the word priorities then comment
television,not_removed,im a big fan of burr otherwise i wouldnt have commented work on your ability to recognize context whether in conversation entertainment or politics
television,not_removed,generic yes comment
television,not_removed,burr of course donald is beyond help his mental condition may be the result of age drug use or both but its clearly irreversible
television,not_removed,popular vote is irrelevant for a reason
television,not_removed,i stand by what i said
television,not_removed,ill rephrase nothing says political victory quite like the lowest entering approval rating in the modern era
television,not_removed,and i stand by what i said bill burr is a great comedian who will probably figure out that his priorities on the subject were fucked up
television,not_removed,they also poll more democrats than republicans in those surveya
television,not_removed,again totally irrelevant he won the election under the rules required a victory is a victory
television,not_removed,again
television,not_removed,sadly true
television,not_removed,youre repeating yourself get tested for conditions associated with that
television,not_removed,i cant im too busy knowing what priorities means
television,not_removed,clearly you dont or you wouldnt still be harping incoherently on it and making zero sense
television,not_removed,im making zero sense do tell what did burr say here that tells us anything about what he sees as being more important than anything else
television,not_removed,there was a study that said the people that talk the most often know the least bill looks like hes getting real tired of this shit
television,not_removed,this is the kind of video you dont want floating around when you have a job interview tucker acts like a year old telling you how to drive a car
television,not_removed,bill nye showed more class than i thought possible in the face of a willful ignorance glorifier
television,not_removed,i love when the guy who has never studied any of this says that the man who has studied these things his entire life doesnt know what hes talking about
television,not_removed,this is painful to watch tucker uses a similar method in most of his debates he latches on to one question and repeats it over and over while constantly interrupting his opponent it works well against inexperienced opponents that arent fully prepared but bill handled it really well the clock on the phone was perfect you could tell tucker was taken back by that
television,not_removed,this is such a weird disturbing thing to watch but idk i dont think he nailed him as bad as jon stewart did nye got it when he said the climate would be like it was in but that was towards the end and citing as a year for climate equivalency to now doesnt inform the super uneducated people whore watching this channel im just sad edit i caught a downvote to clarify im saying that when you say that the climate would be like what it was in to explain climate change thats awesome because shitloads of climate change has happened since but guess what uneducated people dont know the climate change thats happened between now so its not just saying that our climate would be the same as its explaining what the climate was in and tucker couldnt possibly accept nye to expound on that for more than words
television,not_removed,he didnt destroy him but that pasty faced idiot thinks he can get one word answers to complicated questions also the moment they accuse the other person of shouting them down and they werent being shouted down it shows that they are passive aggressive bullies
television,not_removed,both were awful and brought nothing to the issue no destroying happened
television,not_removed,i mean he asked a simple question and got a halfass answer bill failed to explain himself and got called out for it if he is the utmost authority on topics like this then he should really have more thorough answers to simple questions hahaha
television,not_removed,disrespectful and he was asking an unknowable question
television,not_removed,to be fair bill nye is not a climate scientist hes a mechanical engineer and entertainer thats not to say that his opinion is less valid but that those who attribute some sort of scientific ethos to him arent necessarily correct in doing so
television,not_removed,he did explain england wouldnt be growing wine grapes the midwest wouldnt need as much pesticide because it wouldnt tucker interruption
television,not_removed,but simple people require simple answers
television,not_removed,httpsscrippsucsdeduprogramskeelingcurvewpcontentpluginssiobluemoongraphsmlofullrecordpng httpsenwikipediaorgwikigreenhousegas httpsscieducaredulongcontentgreenhouseeffect therefore humans are causing climate change theres no debate here tucker brought no new argument against the concepts of global warming instead argued that people should be allowed to be skeptical of scientific data
television,not_removed,youre either dishonest or very obtuse if you think how would the climate be different without manmade global warming is a simple question
television,not_removed,you clearly have no idea what youre talking about just like tucker the fact that nye has education in mechanical engineering does not mean he has zero education in any other science
television,not_removed,a bachelors degree in mechanical engineering normally requires general classes in math humanities science social sciences and engineering during the first two years and specialized classes during the remaining years the curriculum also incorporates the basics of other engineering disciplines such as chemical electrical and civil engineering typical studies include calculus thermodynamics physics materials science statics dynamics and fluid dynamics and laboratory sections
television,not_removed,no i totally agre tucker laughter mocking me
television,not_removed,therefore humans are causing climate change theres no debate here there wasnt in the video either are humans doing all of the climate change trey parker and matt stone mock anyone that believes that including you
television,not_removed,yes but he isnt a climate expert it doesnt degrade his argument but it is disingenuous to say that he has studied climate science
television,not_removed,look i just prefer straightforward answers not answers about beatles and wine straightforward question requires a straightforward answer end of story bill nye the partisan guy was either underprepared or had no actual answer
television,not_removed,i know this show never got a huge viewership but it was truly phenomenal i really enjoyed it and im glad it stayed true to itself at the end it was funny an dark like nothing else except maybe morel orel review stars
television,not_removed,one of the best comedies ive seen on tv such a sad bleak yet perfect and hilarious finale bravo andy daly and co bravo
television,not_removed,honestly id rather have a network run halfseasons consistently than deal with the pattern that networks constantly find themselves in running three weeks of episodes taking a week off running two episodes taking a monthlong holiday break running four episodes taking a week off to prepare for sweeps etc at least the shows that split up the season into two parts have some consistency with their releases when it comes to network shows those that generally have episodes youll be lucky to get brandnew episodes more than two weeks in a row since theyre trying to stretch a seasons between september and may due to sweeps weeks
television,not_removed,yes the mid season break is really annoying
television,not_removed,twd and got are the only shows i watch weekly now and only because people on social media will spoil all the good stuff if i wait and binge every other show binge i hate waiting a week for a good show and the mid season breaks are annoying
television,not_removed,have you tried watching designated survivor because i swear to christ abc is actively trying to get me to stop watching this show they aired the first four episodes weekly and it was great i set my dvr and watched every episode the night it aired then there was a twoweek break between episodes four and five because of the presidential debates ok fine then there was a twoweek break between episodes five and six because uh i dont know why the election maybe no clue then there was a oneweek break between episodes six and seven and i thought we were going to get back on pace just in time to find out there was another twoweek break between episodes seven and eight for reasons still unknown theyve got three episodes spaced a week apart starting tonight and then bam a couple months off for winter break so essentially in the first four months of a new show theyre showing episodes fuck that im on the verge of bouncing out and binging it on netflix or prime when it comes out and then stations wonder why their ratings are dying a slow death
television,not_removed,i actually very much enjoy taking in an episode one week at a time its the shows like the walking dead that drag their shit for every episode except for the premiere and mid season finales then second half premiere then actual finale that make me wait to binge watch or not watch at all
television,not_removed,every season i get less and less interested in tv because of the waiting namely during summer binging is the only way to go
television,not_removed,i prefer this to the old to episodes per season you were used to a decent story with at least to episodes of filler even the best shows like angel and west wing suffered from this stigma now at least a television show can focus on the story it wants to tell without being beholding to episodes of chaff
television,not_removed,ive completely stopped watching shows week to week now whether its westworld or flash im waiting until the full season is out before watching it all at my own pace
television,not_removed,i agree that the breaks are annoying but i honestly for an ongoing series prefer weekly viewing over binging i love the weekly discussions for each episode and also a set time while for binging everyone watches at different times the episode seasons can be overlong at times but if done right i believe gives a greater reward than the shorter seasons you get more character development as well as more experimentation within the show agents of shield actually solves the episode problem quite well by basically having two main arcs per season one that is before the mid season break and one thats after it definitely shows like arrow and flash dont watch twd sometimes struggle with the pacing of the show but i personally dont think aos suffers this in fact ill say daredevil jessica jones and luke cage have more issues with pacing than aos does
television,not_removed,shows got cancelled so much about a decade ago that i wouldnt watch any show that wasnt at least seasons in i decided to drop that rule this year and i hope im not burned but south parks dark weeks have annoyed me and i probably wont pick up the good place whenever it returns and no one cares about the holidays people are watching their weekly show if its available this isnt the
television,not_removed,supernatural is really bad with this they come back from months off and then skip two weeks every show tries to line up the old formula of ending in may i think its an outdated idea
television,not_removed,of course i thought everyone did this now
television,not_removed,nah my list of shows is honestly so long now that i dont mind when one or two them end up taking a few weeks worth of a break together it gives me time to catch up on other stuff i just havent had the time to catch and when theyre all on break i get to binge entire seasons of things ive wanted to see or rewatch for ages
television,not_removed,i hate this so much i have four shows that i watch on hulu all of which started this fall for the first couple of weeks it was great i could log in on friday and each show would have a brand new episode waiting for me hooray then life got a bit busy and i didnt have as much time to watch tv i would go for two weeks or more without even logging in then finally when i had some free time id log in only to find that only one out of my four shows had one new episode that cant be right can it so i check all my shows and sure enough no new episodes were aired in the weeks that i hadnt been able to watch wtf networks it feels like shows that were on a weekly schedule subtly switched to a onceeverytwoweeks schedule which further devolved into eh well show it whenever the hell we feel like it and its awful
television,not_removed,designated survivor can go fuck itself you had me and played mind games with me so now you dont have me anymore
television,not_removed,right there with you its just annoying plus commercials not only are you inconvenienced having to wait for weeks on end having to remember what you watched weeks ago and having to figure out if your episode is even on that night but then you also have to sit through twenty minutes of commercials to watch a forty minute episode of a show why bother im not even using tv cord cutter here im just talking about the free online episodes that cbs and cw and a couple other channels put on their websites its much easier to just wait it out every show i watch is on netflix if it means having to be a year behind in watching boohoo whatever i can sit down watch my favorites back to back without commercials and enjoy the show another positive is that you dont fall for the cancelled after season if you wait til its on netflix to watch you can find out beforehand if its a oneanddone and spare yourself the heartache of getting invested in a show that gets cancelled on a cliffhanger after the first season
television,not_removed,the real problem with this is that no tv show will ever make it past the first season if the majority of people are waiting for a season to end before watching it you have to remember that networks are basing success and failure on how many people are watching a show while its on if everyone stops watching a show and decides to catch up later the network sees low viewing numbers and assumes its a flop and pulls fundingcancels the show so if you really like a show and want to see it continue you kind of need to watch it week to week it sucks but unless the inherent system changes thats just how it is and yes i realize that streaming numbers are counted as well but they arent looking at streaming numbers from months or even weeks after a show airs
television,not_removed,not really binging has the opposite effect on me than it does for more people i get bored watching the same story and character for straight hours i start zoning out and not caring week to week or even a couple weeks gap actually helps me stay interested i look forward to it i get burned out real fast watching an entire season in one go or over a couple day span i like the breathing room even shows on netflix i try to spread out over a few weeks
television,not_removed,this is how we watch all shows as the only tv service we have is netflix the lack of commercials is a pretty nice perk too
television,not_removed,a coworker of mine does this religiously he also adds the restriction of having something of a popularlycanonically accepted ending to a series this would preclude him from watching shows like how i met your mother where the ending was disliked by many diehard fans because it reverses many seasons worth of character development in one fell swoop he will however watch shows that are based on book series that he is far enough ahead in eg the expanse
television,not_removed,agents of shield will only have a month break this time it will come back in january
television,not_removed,hwith the walking dead i dont understand why they dont do a stand alone four or six part mini series to fill the void zombies took over the entire world give me six episodes of how a group of canadians or minnesotans are dealing with the situation or survivalists in a wyoming ranchcompound to try to capitalize on the westworld cowboy fad or hey maybe area where top minds are putting together plans and weapons to combat the problem maybe you get lucky and find some likable characters then they can replace that shitty fear the walking dead with better people and storylines i guess really what i am saying is that these gaps wouldnt be so bad if they were filling them with something decent even aos you cant find a marvel character that could give you a stand alone three or four episode story arc which in a best case scenario may catch on and be used as a guest character on the main show
television,not_removed,my wife and i have become so jaded with network television we dont even both watching it anymore i had to suck it down to cut the cord losing my redwings games but so be it netflix and newsgroups satisfy us completely and our local pbs has cartoons on for our toddler at just the perfect times waking up in the morning and waking up from midday nap and if we have to we can go online to pbs and load up the cartoons on demand fu cable companies i cant wait till you all die i would pay a month to get all the redwings games live streamedbut probably not maybe
television,not_removed,the only show i ever watch by the week is game of thrones all other shows i wait til the season ends its totally the way to go
television,not_removed,ive been waiting for fargo for so long meow
television,not_removed,spoilers
television,not_removed,not really i have a constant need for new television and ive exhausted a huge amount of the better stuff out there id have to spend a few months watching things ive been putting off digging through old stuff and foreign stuff and then the new season of shows would last me what a month id have to do it all over again times a year or times or whatever it is meanwhile i massively increase the chances of spoiling something for myself im already always searching for other shows to fill the gaps
television,not_removed,ive been doing it this way for years now ever since i ditched cable i take it a bit further now i sometimes wont even watch a show until its completed several seasons this is due to what i call the chris carter effect i dont want to get jerked around by a series that actually has no plan as i was with the xfiles so i wait for a show to demonstrate that therected is some king of coherent story going on before i dive in
television,not_removed,im currently doing this with a few shows and it is way better than waiting week to week and dealing with random breaks and the midseason break sometimes two or three months depending onthe show its great because incan binge the shows i love and i end up watching less tv because shows i didnt enjoy as much or dropped off in quality fall by the wayside looking at you the good wife arrow
television,not_removed,i stopped watching week to week about a year or two ago because i started to feel like a sucker watching a show on live tv you have to deal with commercials that break up the momentum emotion and pacing of a show going week to week means you are watching on appointment viewing and scheduling your life around a tv show considering the level of dvr and streaming technology seems really dumb also you have to deal with the breaks as you stated so now i basically start the network shows that i care about in the summer after the season ends and being them at my leisure in a lot of ways i feel like the current formats are a holdover from a time where tv watching meant something different in a societal way than it does now and tv networks and creators need to find ways to adapt
television,not_removed,i used to be an every weekevery episode kind of tvwatcher now i find myself far too busy with life to keep to a tv schedule so every couple of weeks i find myself streaming episodes of a show at a time over weekends when i have some free time most of the network websites have the latest episodes of a show up so as long as i dont get too far behind i wont miss an episode
television,not_removed,tv shouldnt be such a big part of life go ride a bike or do some drugs or something who gives a fuck if they take a break its probably so they can give the actors a break and reset production just watch something else
television,not_removed,i save up quality shows like mr robot and binge them after wards but snacks like flash or arrow i just watch weekly its fun to follow them but its nothing amazingly special that i really need to save up
television,not_removed,the last television show i watched weekly was lost nothing has been worth the trouble since then
television,not_removed,i still watch walking dead because i have watched the show from the start but i am looking forward to each new episode less and less its a clusterfuck of individual stories now it seems edit i mean whats the ultimate goal now getting away from the saviors i absolutely hate negan what a douchey noncredible character bad guys in this show should be more like the governor he was serious not a cocky asshole like every other bad guy in this series maybe negans behaviour is based on the original comic character i dont knowi just wanna punch him in the face so badmaybe thats exactly what the producers want but id have preferred a serious kind of bad guy instead i dont think people in such a cruel apocalyptic world would have negans attitude but thats just my opinion rant out
television,not_removed,american scheduling always seems crazy oh theres no episode of that this week oh this show is off for weeks i think a show debuted then had weeks off this season or last i always save them up and binge as an aside anyone have a clue where to find mid season finale details i tend to check returndates website which sometimes differs from wiki or latest news
television,not_removed,thats how i got started watching the vampire diaries i got bored and had to wait so instead of catching up on my regular shows im going to finish that then binge watch my shows at the end
television,not_removed,i did this for four game of thrones seasons heh let me tell you
television,not_removed,i did this with season of twd i got so fed up with the boring episodes weeks in a row then really good episode month break then more boring ones then two really good ones one boring one then season finale
television,not_removed,ive never watched full seasons live anymore started about years ago it does suck sometimes with got and wd but its pretty easy to be naïve and not know the spoilers binge watching is amazing
television,not_removed,at least you get regular seasons doctor who hasnt had a regular season episode since september
television,not_removed,already have i pvr shows i like but dont care much about and wait for the full seasons for the ones i do care about i almost never watch live tv
television,not_removed,the next episode of agents of shield is the midseason finale too were literally just getting less episodes than we would have normally
television,not_removed,cant stand it if i cannot binge a season im not interested in the show simple as that thank you house of cards for setting a new standard for shows releasing entire seasons at once and letting the viewer decide when to watch control is nice
television,not_removed,personally i like the decemberjanuary break each year it lets me get my dvr cleaned up
television,not_removed,midseason breaks are bad but i do enjoy weekly viewing westworld to cite your example would be nowhere near as fun if me and my buddy werent going back and forth with theory talk time off lets you absorb everything and think about whats possible if you binge you lose out on some of that tension a guy went missing hes been gone for two weeks but for you it was just an hour and you never really cared to consider the what ifs in your impatience now certain shows are designed for binging like stranger things with its excellent pacing but i still think there is value in a weekly show opposed to a bingerelease
television,not_removed,agents of shield does it so you see the movies that get released in between to relate them into the show
television,not_removed,its very annoying during the winter season as everything preempts the schedule if you want to kill a show off quick the best thing you can do is make showing of it inconsistent people fall into routines so when you dont do a good job of getting people to stay home on a friday night to watch this show for multiple weeks on end then people forget and some wont come back and if they do its already too late
television,not_removed,personally i prefer watching live for the community interaction particularly here on reddit if you wait to binge you have no one to talk about the shows with
television,not_removed,im old so i usually think the old way is the best this is no exception back in the day they ran a show from sept to may then reruns or a summer replacement from june to sept it works really well
television,not_removed,not considering already been doing that for years
television,not_removed,i just started watching on amazon prime video i have no idea how you guys survived watching it weektoweek it really feels like it was made with streaming in mind despite it being made almost a decade before that was even considered a possibility
television,not_removed,i am with you but to make it a little easier i recommend an app called tv show favs on android it can be used to keep track of watchedunwatched episodes of your show upcoming episodes or if you have any recent unwatched episodes httpsplaygooglecomstoreappsdetailsidcomtvshowfavshlen
television,not_removed,already there wont watch any show during the season save for game of thrones and thats only because spoilers are impossible to avoid when everyone is watching
television,not_removed,yes i made the mistake of doing the free month of hbo now shifty stream btw for westworld after the episode i had an intense regret of starting now but in part its the shows fault they manipulate the audience with cliffhangers and secrets blame lost i guess in a way fuck these shows for doing that
television,not_removed,i rather like it this way if i watch a show for weeks then wait a year i forget alot of what happened but this way i remember more of the show and it helps me get back into it quicker
television,not_removed,considering how many of the new series i start from the beginning that get cancelled mid way or at the end i basically just do that now im tired of investing so much time and effort into something with no benefit
television,not_removed,yeah ive started doing this i cant stay interested in a episode season when half of it is filler and half of the remaining half is a mix ive started to dislike monsteroftheweekcaseoftheweektype shows designated survivorthe blacklist and i only watch shows with one main storyline or at least a story in the background throughout its run stranger things the expanse westworld
television,not_removed,the biggest problem with walking dead is not v the mid season break its that it is a trash show
television,not_removed,dude you are watching television style that is no longer feasible now that most new shows average around episodes per season instead of the regular episodes we are used to you need to switch to netflix hulu and other streaming options ever since streaming became big i havent even turned on our satellite tv
television,not_removed,i never watch any shows until they are all out i learned my lesson from lost just endless cliffhangers for a crappy show also i cant stand it and have to binge watch episodes in days or ill spontaneously explode its science
television,not_removed,yes but part of it has to do with me not wanting to torrent a episode weekly
television,not_removed,thats what designated survivor is doing right now and it is so fucking annoying
television,not_removed,op must be under and doesnt remember what tv used to be like show show rerun show preempted due to sportsball games and moved to some unknown time without announcement rerun holiday show show rerun from seasons ago show the weeks in a row or out of followed by a month break is way better
television,not_removed,ive mostly started doing this i only keep up with shows if its something everyone is talking about and im tired of missing out on the conversation
television,not_removed,i usually wait until the end of the month and go on the channels website and watch the episodes i havent seen there are commercials but i get a few episodes at a time and i can do other things in the evenings
television,not_removed,depends on the show
television,not_removed,i never watch shows week to week i always download a whole season at a time
television,not_removed,if i had that impulse control i wouldnt be binge watching in the first place
television,not_removed,yeah itd be nice to wait but i get to worried about being hearing spoilers
television,not_removed,honestly i feel like the shows i enjoy the most or did love more than the others were the ones that i binge watched i was there the whole storyline and my thoughts werent interrupted by a week or two
television,not_removed,dude ive been doing this since the sopranos i dont watch a show til its done then i watch all of it unless its a show i really love then ill binge each of the seasons one at a time
television,not_removed,ive been doing that since season of the walking dead yeah the long breaks are crazy shows back in the day pumped out way more episodes at a faster rate and the quality was pretty good what gives
television,not_removed,i always binge watch my tv shows i mean the ones with episodes per season i cant wait week after week for a new episode or a mid season thats month long for that matter suits for example i didnt start the new season because of the hiatus cause i know that if i had already watched the first episodes id forget to watch the new ones i prefer to have the control of having all the episodes and choose when to watch maybe one per day or just in one day
television,not_removed,im doing exactly what you suggest with westworld im not even going to bother untill the entire season is done then ill cram it into a wend
television,not_removed,no because of spoilers
television,not_removed,already there my friend not watching agents of shield until sometime next year
television,not_removed,the worst ive ever seen is stargate having mid season breaks that last three months i remember people in the us having to wait for other countries to catch up sometimes canada but a lot of the times it was the sky one broadcasts before they could continue watching but it still took a long time to catch up so they were only really watching the episodes a week or two earlier than the us because of it i do understand why theyd maybe skip a week during thanksgiving or the christmas and new year weeks but its really twoards the end of the season that it gets worse as theyll throw in breaks of a few weeks between episodes to make it all stretch out to sweeps
television,not_removed,been my play for years do it with everything but got just not worth the spoilers if you dont watch it same day of release
television,not_removed,midseason break is one of the things that made it easy for me to stop watching twd on top of it being shittier lately
television,not_removed,american networks just do my head in with this shit id be getting into a show and oh week break oh yeah its getting good again ohhhh week break godamnit oh wait last episodes of the season yay wait what a week break between them wtf
television,not_removed,i dont see what the big deal is im not on that much of a schedule that i get upset if my stories arent on every week if i miss an episode ill check it out on hulu if its on and im free great if theres a midseason thingy its all good i prefer to watch as it airs the inability to pause forces you to be in the moment with it and makes it more exciting but no big
television,not_removed,do any networks do this besides amc twd is the only show i watch weekly
television,not_removed,i out right decided i was done with advertised television years ago i have only binge watched completed seasons since i am much happier and know more about the shows i watch the problem is if everyone did like me wed all have no tv someone has to suffer through the garbage so we can enjoy consecutive episodes uninterrupted just the way it is
television,not_removed,its going to be a trade off if you binge watch you dont get the pleasure of waiting a week on a cliffhanger take lost for example they find this weird hatch in the forest what on earth could it be lets find out right now on the other hand and ill continue to use lost as the example if you watch it weekly you get to participate in all the fan speculation and discussion you dont have to worry about someone accidentally spoiling a major moment in the show because youre watching it at the same time and rate as they are sometimes its more entertaining to watch weekly shows like game of thrones and westworld immediately come to mind but yeah sometimes you just want to binge watch the whole damn show black mirror id say
television,not_removed,the biggest drawback to saving the show to bing eatch is the cost of the social aspect of the show since everyone around me is always on top of the shit thats being released i kind of have to be on their schedule if i expect to be able to talk about the show with the same intensity and up to date knowledge that only comes from watching the episodes as soon as they come out i love getting totally wrapped up in a new a show in fact i just watched all but the finale of a westworld in a day and a half but there is some advantage to having a week or so to digest all the new information when i went on that subreddit when i was finished i was shocked st some of the underlying plot lines and theories upon rewatching some of these more subtle things started making mor sense and i cant help to think that if i watched each episode a couple times over the week then my understanding would have time to really take foot and id have been able to piece more of the puzzle together
television,not_removed,shows need to be watched with the first day or two that they air so that your watching it counts in the shows initial ratings if ratings arent high enough the show will get cancelled
television,not_removed,i only binge watch theres not a lot of shows i actually follow closely while theyre still going but with game of thrones its always hard to basically avoid social contact for months but i couldnt bear to wait a week between episodes the downside of binge watching in my case is that i forget literally everything that happens
television,not_removed,my wife and i watched the first episode of the current season of walking dead but now we are waiting for more of them to come out before continuing
television,not_removed,im already there its been a while since ive watched a show weekly got sick of trying to track everything weekly now i just watch it when its done
television,not_removed,people with your viewing tastes are exactly why netflix exists and theres nothing wrong with that i feel that way with some shows but with something as upper echeleon as westworld i could never wait as i would be afraid to be spoiled
television,not_removed,swings and roundabouts i hate waiting for the next epi but if i have every episode at my fingers tips i never finish
television,not_removed,yeah i wait until the season is over for the most part currently my only exception is westworld otherwise im going to wait until i can watch them all
television,not_removed,i pretty much binge watch shows after the season ends
television,not_removed,if you dont mind waiting and things like netflix dont have it dvr is awesome
television,not_removed,already do the life of a pirate
television,not_removed,would be nice to hear from a showrunner or someone in the industry to explain the tradeoffs they make with all of these breaks and short seasons is it really about the networks assumptions about ratings as op suggests or is it economic eg production costs location shooting schedules union rules studio or network politics cause in our house we will give up on a marginal series out of sight out of mind even though it is still one the dvr not work the time to get reinvested in the characters or the plot lines
television,not_removed,something i thought youd have mention is also spoilers are so much more prevalent when you watch it weekly while browsing reddit and listening to a companion podcast i call it spoilers but i should more refer to it as fan theories that happened to be right while binging you have less time to process what has happened so the shock factor is so much better netflix is the future of how tv should be
television,not_removed,stopped watching walking dead live because a single episode drags waaaaay too much its much better binged where i can do other things during the scenes where literally nothing happens ive been binging gotham every few episodes i stopped watching agents of shield after season i wanted to wait and binge but just never found the interest did it best by delaying their show until january and then airing episodes over weeks with blocks
television,not_removed,i hear you about agents of shield just came back from the week break then as i watch previews for next week it says on the winter finale wtf why did you take a week break to air fucking episodes
television,not_removed,i do this
television,not_removed,i gave up on two shows entirely a few years ago because of this exact thing i didnt willingly give up on them either i just forgot about them because of how long the breaks were i didnt end up finishing the shows until they finally got to netflix since then ive only watched shows once a season got to netflix
television,not_removed,i actually quite like it i spend a lot of time trying to catch up on tv shows that i once missed for example im currently watching my way through xfiles however at the same time im keeping up to date on south park and brooklyn ninenine with them currently being inseason it means i can drop in on brooklyn ninenine when a new episode comes out and immediately resume with watching xfiles afterwards without having to worry about falling behind
television,not_removed,already stopped weekly viewing years ago around the time of battlestar galactica
television,not_removed,yes i enjoyed the first two episodes of the expanse but it was clear it was going to be a long burn bettered enjoyed when i could binge a whole season at a time i dont have the time or mental energy to focus on a show week to week
television,not_removed,walking dead basically fell off my radar and i lost all interest when season was on tv the mid season finale came about then that three month hiatus or whatever and i was like who the fuck cares what happened to them now game of thrones is on
television,not_removed,i mostly binge watch now days even managed it on got though you have to be careful to avoid spoilers on big shows
television,not_removed,i dont really watch anything as it airs now unless i think i wont be able to find it anywhere else pretty much everyone i know uses ondemand services and netflix etc and since things like that have become so popular it seems counter productive to break shows up more than they already did
television,not_removed,ive been always doing this actually most of the times i wait for the entire show to finish the only shows i follow each season are supernatural and sherlock with sherlock being the only show i follow each episode
television,not_removed,shows like steven universe and rick and morty kill me with this su had new episodes everyday for two weeks then nothing for nearly months like wth am i supposed to do with that rick and morty still isnt back and its been over a year
television,not_removed,already have i binge watch seasons for everything now
television,not_removed,waiting for the whole season is how i watch of my shows lately however westworld got me week for week first show to do that in a long time
television,not_removed,ive given up on television for this and many other reasons internet streaming is where its at netflix etc
television,not_removed,i am sick of these midseason breaks they are pure garbage
television,not_removed,i already just wait fucking week to week is annoying and immersion breaking as shit
television,not_removed,its the only way to get through arrow now just do it all in one burst instead of chinese water torture
television,not_removed,everyone complaining about half season waits for twd and im just sitting here waiting like years for the next season of sherlock
television,not_removed,soon as i read the preview i knew you were talking about walking dead walking dead is the one show that still like to pull the old school tv gimmicks and its fucking annoying i was thinking this exact thing after last episode
television,not_removed,i started this back in about i mean yeah at first it was more look i like your show and all but i have a life to live so im just not going to let you dictate my schedule telling me when i can watch what i like but since about or so weve had television seasons available on dvd and its been better and better since i think the only thing i missed in its original airing that mattered and its admittedly a huge one was firefly
television,not_removed,yep dreading the mid season break for my dctv shows
television,not_removed,for some shows i watch like aos if it wasnt for my tivo i wouldnt know when some new episodes are airing
television,not_removed,thats why i dont even bother and just wait for the dvd release that and i cant get broadband where i live but thats a whole different story
television,not_removed,walking dead drives me nuts with the way amc gives episodes over months then wait months for the other episodes this is another way netflix is killing regular tvcable networks let me watch all n one day or whenever i have time dont expect me to drop everything at on thursday who has time for that anymore
television,not_removed,i already do this its awesome sort your new shows by your own criteria either netflix or buy bluray etc literally everything you watch on cabledirectv at a premium price can be viewed for pennies on the dollar if you just wait what do you miss out on all the tweets from live viewers and spoilers dang
television,not_removed,not quite the same but i basically gave up on watching the venture bros since they took so long between seasons i couldnt remember what happened three years ago i figure ill wait until the series ends sometime in and then binge watch the whole thing on my retinal opticator discs from the bed of my nursing home then die
television,not_removed,yep i agree i just watched the first seasons of greys anatomy on netflix and then hulu for the first half of this current season over the last weeks and now im stuck having to wait until freaking january for it to pick back up for the back end of this season waiting sucks also commercials suck im ready to ditch tv altogether i havent actually turned on my directv box since election night and im perfectly happy to keep it this way
television,not_removed,i wish i could binge because of these breaks i dont have internet at home and no cell phone carriers give a strong enough signal to make it worth a data plan im stuck with intermittent shows im looking at you disney xd and svtfoe and it makes me not want to care anymore i understand breaks and skewed times on local networks that have to show news coverage and sporting events but now other networks do it too it makes no sense because i feel like theyre losing even those who can stream they get rid of standard television find other things because many of those companies have shows now then the networks show gets looked over because meh who cares there has to be a better way
television,not_removed,it was one thing when the networks ran a holiday special on christmas but now they dont air a single new episode from thanksgiving to christmas half the time you forget the show existed and it ends up being cancelled for low ratings
television,not_removed,you think thats bad tnts the last ship comes out with a new season every june you gotta wait forever for the new season
television,not_removed,thats why i love netflix and streaming shows no ads no waiting and always available downside the streaming pop up shit and staying up all night cause the next episode is seconds away and i cant say no to another episode
television,not_removed,i cant stand episode seasons of anything and only is definitely pushing it i enjoy a show that runs weekly for the full weeks and unless its the walking dead i will binge watch the shows that choose to air then in split seasons that is the worst thing to ever happen to tv shows
television,not_removed,i have never had cable in my life i have no idea why people pay for it
television,not_removed,cut the cord bro every single show is available on netflixhulu eventually you just have to dodge spoilers for some of the big ones for a couple weeks when they are being televised
television,not_removed,there was no doctor who in a part of me has been dead all year
television,not_removed,yup ive been doing this for the past few years way better and so much easier to pick up on plots and little details in a good series
television,not_removed,people love to binge but i dont think its the right choice its good to break things up sometimes i do agree the random breaks suck though
television,not_removed,im guessing op also watched agents of shield last night after a break just for them to announce the winter finale is next week
television,not_removed,already doing this with the walking dead im not sure if the last seasons were just the show getting worse or if i enjoyed the previous seasons more because i could see the story without interruptions
television,not_removed,its been several years that i do not watch tv in realtime anymore i only binge watch tv shows when i have at least a season full on netflix or on less reputable sources apart all the obvious things i did not like the sense of being tied to something to be watched regularly being not interested in sport politics or talk shows i have very few occasions to turn tv on now that my sons do not use it anymore to play videogames
television,not_removed,i am so done with long commercials every minutes amazon prime and netflix for me
television,not_removed,ive been doing this for years
television,not_removed,ive been doing that since lost i watch got one month at a time
television,not_removed,someone mentioned this in the westworld subreddit but i actually prefer this to the binge method it allows for each episode to be mulled over and discussed with the viewer base all being at the same spot in the story ill take the midseason finale for them to finish filming over a later start time
television,not_removed,op you might want to check listings im fairly sure westworld is getting a week break before the finale im not on that but i heard it recently im a huge fan as well so i wish it wouldnt although its still better than the month break for walking dead
television,not_removed,i have no problem watching an episode a week when i have different shows to watch what i do have a problem with is them all being on different schedules some dont take breaks some take long breaks some skip every weeks its annoying and hard to keep up with well it was until i cut the cord now i binge them all during the summer
television,not_removed,i found myself doing this as well especially with flash even if i got into the habit of watching the new episode every week the month break in the middle would ruin the routine and id forget about it by the time i remembered the episode where i left off was expired now ive given up and just watch it on netflix a year late my guess is i wouldnt do that if anyone at work had the same taste in tv i do though being able to talk about new episodes is probably the only thing that would get me to stay current
television,not_removed,this crap combined with the excessive advertising is one of the big reasons i never paid for a tv subscription three things that they need to do asap to stop hemorrhaging subscribers a la carte channels pick a revenue stream if ads i wont payif i pay no ads all programming needs to be ondemand its ok if the scheduled channels also still exist but they arent enough on their own
television,not_removed,i pretty much already do this thank you netflix
television,not_removed,agreed watching lucifer the next episode is january they are leaving off in the middle of a major plot line and at this point if i didnt watch it in a group id wait till it was all online
television,not_removed,yeah had to give up on twd once they started doing the split seasons the show also started sucking too
television,not_removed,i didnt watch games of throne for seasons because of it same with walking dead im looking for some free time to catch on on both shows john snow is still dead for me and no one need to tell me otherwise
television,not_removed,the little gaps are annoying but as someone who binged a lot previously and recently started weekbyweek viewing i definitely prefer the week by week i feel like i can appreciate the show a lot more and the timeline feels more natural along with character and plot development ive felt myself losing touch with characters who changed too fast for me just because i watched like seasons in a shot whereas watching over the original year period would have been understandable and more enjoyable i hate the little breaks but i watch so many shows that theres always something else to watch or short binges to catchup on something that ive fallen behind on this works for me and still beats going back to binge watching full seasons
television,not_removed,i generally enjoy binge watching instead of week to week but westworld is an exception all the small details in this show if i was binge watching this id miss so much i like being able to think about the episode for a week and read theories on rwestworld but yes mid season breaks are stupid just air the whole damn season
television,not_removed,just remember how far technology has come to allow us to binge a whole series digitally
television,not_removed,i only have like shows i watch weekly and those are the ones i think i would have hard time avoiding spoilers for the rest are saved til the season is over and binged
television,not_removed,i just want stranger things season so bad
television,not_removed,as a gravity fallsadventure time fan you know nothing about the horrors waiting and waiting for the next new episode
television,not_removed,i always binge watch if its a good show i want to know what happens next so i hate having to wait through the breaks
television,not_removed,what struck me as really stupid is vikings this season they split the season in and put like months between the split the second half of the season starts soon and when it ends the next season will begin in only a couple months it doesnt make sense
television,not_removed,my wife does this with a lot of shows she has shows she watches every week but dvrs a whole season of shows to watch later
television,not_removed,just fyi it is due in no small part not do
television,not_removed,the problem with network tv is that they are running shows like the internet doesnt exist with netflix and other streaming options where one can just binge watch networks are failing to keep audiences interested with the exception of the flash im going to binge watch all the other shows next year
television,not_removed,seriously just stop watching tv marx was wrong religion isnt the opiate of the masses television is go out and do something or read you will be happier and live a better more fulfilling life
television,not_removed,meh i mean its a minor annoyance hey i love a binge and theres a part of me that doesnt like the wait but then as a creative writer im very much one for suspense and mystery i dont like to know the answers i love to be surprised i dont do fan theories until after ive seen the material in full i dont do trailers i flick off when it comes to the next week on blah blah blah this whole frustration with waiting thing just feels to me like a reflection of the high consumption society we live in though i take no issue with someone who has the patience to sit out the series until its finished and then finally dip in for one nice tidy binge as i agree that keeping the story fresh in your mind is relatively choreish and can have damaging effects towards your own capacity to piece together the hints and foreshadowing references etc when there are long gaps between each episode ops plan sounds tidy
television,not_removed,i skipped all of cws superhero block this season im waiting for it to show up on netflix first their own app then tons of ads then drawn out schedule nope enough of this its not enjoyable anymore
television,not_removed,welcome to what the rest of the world does
television,not_removed,i have the same conclusion but different reasons alot of streaming services only offer the last episodes and its hard for me to keep up with every show i enjoy so i am now regulating certain shows to binging cause i cant keep up the agents break actually helped me catch up with supergirl i just wished it was consistent weeks on off would be great for me
television,not_removed,i will just be over here with my anime ancient magus bride episode when
television,not_removed,it the show has a continuous story i only binge watch it after the season is over if it doesnt then ill watch them as they come and im even thinking about binge watching shows after the whole show is over because many shows will be just canceled if the ratings are not good enough abruptly without a closure and nobody gives you that time wasted watching unfinished show back
television,not_removed,this is the problem with scripted shows on the broadcast networks that have to constantly interrupt the season for awards shows presidential debates breaking news seasonal specials live sports other live events avoiding all of the above on different networks and generally spacing out the season so the big events on the show itself fall in sweeps months and the season runs from september through june at least on cable networks the season runs whenever they want and they dont care when it is and dont air anything else
television,not_removed,i do this already apart from topical shows which dont follow a story anyway the only exception is the walking dead which i feel like i have to watch immediately because of spoilers ive never seen another show get such a reaction on the internet when its aired never had that problem with other shows as an example its so much easier to watch the good wife without spoilers than it is twd and im waiting until got is completely finished before i watch any episodes for this same reason im sure ive read plenty of spoilers by now but they mean nothing to me so i instantly forget them when the show is finished ill be able to binge watch in my own time at my own leisure and spoiler free
television,not_removed,as someone who cut the cord years ago it took me longer than id like to admit to figure out what this was talking about cut the cord your problems will go away
television,not_removed,already do especially for shows that are seriously character based like bcs i just wait till theyre all finished then watch them its funny though because a lot of the time in the past shows were made with these weeklong and monthlong gaps between episodes and seasons so they were written in a way that was meant to keep you interested as far as i can tell nowadays regular shows not counting bingeseries like netflix originals etc are sometimes better sometimes worse but they dont have that same feel as old shows sure they might end on a cliffhanger but its rarely one thats dire enough to make me or my family go omg whats gonna happen next week funny how that works
television,not_removed,binging
television,not_removed,agree i now wait until the end of a season to catch up and watch like a movie missing weeks is so annoying
television,not_removed,yes
television,not_removed,i completely agree why did they start thus whole mid season break thingy it sucks
television,not_removed,i hate the way ads have ruined tv youtube and now gaming im not watching ads anymore its gotten to a point where i do everything to avoid watching ads i stick to netflix amazon prime and hbo all are pay services but without ads
television,not_removed,all just theory but i think its just an evil marketing plan you get people hooked on a show every wednesday on fxxxx come next wednesday at you sit down to watch your show again but its just a rerun you think meh this sucks but you watch it anyway the thing is you are still probably going to wait for the new one and watch it too so they get extra views for the same amount of content just stretched out
television,not_removed,im of the same mind i havent started watching the new season of the walking dead for this reason ill wait until its over to see the whole thing they overuse cliffhangers and then they also use fake outs after the end of i swore i wouldnt watch it on tv ill stream it once its all out unless i hear there are more cliffhangers end of in which case ill wait again westworld is different though i feel satisfied after every episode as theres so much to think about and they dont do cliffhanger endings they do reveal endings leaves you satisfied and still lets you think what this new reveal will mean for the next episode and also if that changes the meanings of past episodes im just sick of feeling left hanging if you know what i mean its bullshit and a cheap tactic its lazy and played out im tired of it
television,not_removed,id much prefer it if tv stopped doing these ridiculous forever runs and just told a story to completion then moved on to the next one
television,not_removed,i feel like this about a lot of shows usually but honestly ive been really enjoying the anticipation of hbo shows got westworld the end of season wait is agonizing but in between each week is good bc each episode has so much information to digest so many clues and reading about mind blowing theories if i were to marathon through each season i dont think the shows would feel as epic the hbo specials are the only shows i feel this way about though other shows id rather marathon i think its bc theres so much filler sometimes that you feel very unsatisfied after one or two episodes
television,not_removed,i only bingewatch no television
television,not_removed,ive been doing this for about months now and it honestly just happened on accident i missed a few episodes because life got busy and by the time i realized it the episodes were no longer on demand so i just waited until they were on netflix i highly recommend it
television,not_removed,i did this with walking dead just waited for it to come out on netflix then binged it
television,not_removed,this is the reason i still have noy seen the last season or two of mad men and one of the reasons i gave up on the walking dead it is absolutely absurd to split a show up into seasons of episodes each aired months apart just to milk the franchise it is bad enough that hbo shows release one per week during a episode season compared to netflix dropping them all at once flr binge watching
television,not_removed,this practice of breaking up seasons and mid season finales cannot die soon enough walking dead pulledstarted this shit and i will never forgive it for it
television,not_removed,wait people arent doing this already
television,not_removed,eh it makes no difference to me show gets aired when it gets aired picked up by rss downloaded automatically and it shows up in plex
television,not_removed,this is how ive watched the last seasons of supernatural
television,not_removed,i actually prefer the spread out break when its like months between shows i lose interest when its just a couple months im more interested in the show
television,not_removed,its things like these that make me laugh when network execs sit there and scratch their heads pondering why tv is dying
television,not_removed,its annoying but i still watch week to week because i dont want to get spoiled especially for my favorite shows
television,not_removed,tbh thats pretty much the only way i watch shows at this point lifes kind of weird atm so sitting down on a schedule just isnt going to happen plus services like netflix kind of spoiled me i also found that with shows like got that have a lot of story lines going on all at once its much easier to follow over a week instead of
television,not_removed,i think people are just used to instant gratification if your show isnt on go do something else
television,not_removed,thats all i do nowadays its like the switch from cable to netflix its just the best way to do it
television,not_removed,vikings is back
television,not_removed,this is already my philosophy
television,not_removed,the relatively new iirc mid season breaks are a pia for sure i have to go and research how this came about and who likes it and why but yeah its hateful as for the binging vs weekly debate which for sure must have been addressed ad nauseum here for me the jurys out having time to digest an episode has many positive benefits in my opinion you bond more deeply with the characters and if the show is wellwritten you have a longer opportunity to consider whatever ethical quandries are in play or other interesting aspects of the charactersplotsetwritingetc on the other hand few would argue that instant gratification isnt extremely pleasurable
television,not_removed,i found that breaks in several series has been enough for me to just give up entirely and stop watching altogether funny i seem to be surviving without the affair or man in the high tower homeland and all i just dont give a crap once i see that after months my life seems just fine without the next episode of blablabla
television,not_removed,south parks dark weeks have been bothering me a little bit ill be honest i was looking forward to staying up late last week and watching an episode before thanksgiving but of course they were on a break i guess thats fair trey and matt have families too bobs burgers has been doing the same thing too except for weeks ago when for some reason new episodes aired i just want a consistent schedule
television,not_removed,i always watch this way the only issue i have is sometimes i start watching a new season and have literally forgotten what the fk is going on and i have learned to watch the last episode of the last season before starting a new season
television,not_removed,considering giving up or completely gave up years ago screw live tv
television,not_removed,i dont think ive watched a tv show season on tv in at least a year i binge it on netflix or record everything and watch after the season ends when i can fast forward commercials and watch the episodes one after another
television,not_removed,yes
television,not_removed,everything about the traditional television model is broken just the constant commercial breaks is enough for me to wait and just binge it
television,not_removed,thats my secret i never watch a show until the season is over except got people will ruin that shit for me
television,not_removed,you cant do this for very popular shows like walking dead which has long midseason breaks or game of thrones which is doing a split final season because of spoilers online sure other shows its fine to do this but not the bigticket popular shows or else youre screwed
television,not_removed,i cant remember the last show i followed weekly bingewatching only
television,not_removed,youre still watching every week i gave that shit up years ago
television,not_removed,i agree with your complaint but disagree with your solution midseason finales are the dumbest thing ever its purely the abuse of the cliffhanger long midseason breaks also suck thats part f why i love agent carter that show slid in perfectly and id love to see limited series fillin some of these timeslots however i enjoy weekly tv its a better storytelling platform each episode has to stand on its own as a short story as opposed to bingeing where the chapters are irrelevant with respect to the full novel think dickens if you read dickens as was originally presented you would like him far more than reading him as novels he was not a novelist he was a serial storyteller there is a place for serial storytelling and i dont want the binge addicts to take this from me
television,not_removed,i used to not care so much because usually id be shows like south park archer bobs burgers etc shows that you dont really have to closely follow because each episode can easily stand on its on then those shows started having consistent story line that progresses throughout the season still fun to watch but its quite annoying to try and figure out what i remember from the last episode so i can make sense of whats happening
television,not_removed,this is why i could not get into tv growing up theres few shows ill watch weeklyseasonally
television,not_removed,as a netflixprime viewer this is already how i watch tv shows it was kickstarted by having a child and no time to watch tv dropping cable then picking it back up streaming services introduced me to new tv shows that were already at least a year old netflix and prime typically dont get new episodes until about a year after they air
television,not_removed,how do you mean considering this is how ive been watching tv for quite a while now set a bunch of recordings let things build up and when a seasons over go through and binge over a week or two there are also some shows i havent even bothered with starting yet because i want to see if theyll last long enough to get a few seasons of content before i try them
television,not_removed,i remember when there used to be reruns on tv i would wait all week for a new episode of my favourite show plop myself down in front of the tv and pray i had not seen it before it started so op stop the whining
television,not_removed,i wait until the entire series is over
television,not_removed,i started doing this around years ago when battlestar galactica had over a year between seasons is it october yet was a thing because the previous season had ended what the previous september
television,not_removed,ive thought about this for sure
television,not_removed,ive been doing exactly that for over years since back when you had to do wait for the dvds and i cant think of a reason not too its a much better way to watch tv
television,not_removed,this is actually why i prefer hulu for my tv viewing if there is no new episode one week they wont update the episode list also no commercials
television,not_removed,i only ever tend to start watching series when they are on the second season anyway so i usually just binge then wait for to be completely released and binge that i hate waiting for mid season and i suck at waiting weekly only exception is got i watch that weekly
television,not_removed,i dont mind the midseason breaks so much its only about months however they split the group into places and were seeing group per week watching weekly it feels like its taking forever to progress the story used to run into the issue with holiday breaks then they moved the show to january and ran it straight weeks twd should do something similar maybe they should just do twd and fear twd one in the fall augnov and one in the spring febmay splitting both seasons into half seasons is kinda dumb
television,not_removed,its called netflix i started doing this years ago
television,not_removed,as an animationcartoon fan the pain of the hiatus never ends tt
television,not_removed,i already do this ill wait till a show finishes until watching if its a mystery show ill wait even longer until i find out if its going to last or get cancelled early
television,not_removed,there is so much good tv right now i skip a lot of shows and just watch them after a season or are completed who has time for all that great tv
television,not_removed,yeah bobs burgers is annoying for this though thats kinda what fox does to shows they dont like and want to cancel
television,not_removed,ive always hated this model and when i discovered doctor who was totally blown away by the whole season being shown in one run now granted british televison seasons are usually much shorter but the damage was done and i now hate the american tv model as it stands ive thought if i ever became filthy rich i would start a production company with a mission statement of breaks what breaks that would produce quality televison with only minimal breaks or weeks tops for holidays and a short summer month at the most
television,not_removed,this is what i do ive only watched the first episode of westworld so far and said whoa let me wait i do this with every show got the night of at that time better call saul im waiting for preacher to hit netflix to check it out but yeah i personally prefer it this way
television,not_removed,this is my approach to watching tv series i dont watch them as theyre aired i only watch once the seasonseries is over so i dont have to deal with their silly games
television,not_removed,id rather them take the time they need to write and produce the shows at their leisure and some distance from the show refreshes the pallette bingeing is not a habit i can condone watching something just to watch something is unwitting to the quality of your exposure and even if the show is actually quality you are certainly dulling the experience not to mention reinforcing a bad habit
television,not_removed,i really love but cannot stand suspense so i started bingeing ages ago plopping weeks of blank into a series really detracts from the experience and i would think discourages fanship
television,not_removed,yes
television,not_removed,yea how am i supposed to ignore my empty life without instant gratification im gonna write a letter
television,not_removed,i stopped viewing shows weekly years ago i only watch in commercial free complete seasons
television,not_removed,i already did we gave up on cable years ago and its been glorious we split the account fees with several friends and share the passwords so we all have access to hbogo netflix shudder hulu and amazon prime and it still costs less than cable
television,not_removed,my biggest bitch about walking dead and others is the week season im gonna reveal my age somewhat but i remember when a tv shows season was weeks
television,not_removed,way ahead of you too bad some shows are lowering the bar even further cough walking dead cough and cant even manage to complete a season without bush league cliffhangers
television,not_removed,its been annoying me for a while so ive been saving up certain tv shows until the season ends and then ill watch all of it currently doing this with fresh off the boat westworld so excited to see it and lucifer starting next season probably also with more shows i also just dont have time during the week to watch all of the shows that are currently airing for example how to get away with murder is really pissing me off right now full months until the next episode which is the season finale hate this
television,not_removed,the walking dead outside of the first episode has been brutal i wish i would of waited and just binged most likely will do this for the next half
television,not_removed,yep except for a few shows like got that are so big the internet will spoil me i always wait until the season is over then i watch at my own pace usually an episode every few days once a week is too long to wait but watching an episode a day is too much considering all the shows i watch
television,not_removed,i started complaining about this during the next to last season of house i just accepted it because i believe this happened because it is a part of the deal created from the writers strike years ago
television,not_removed,welcome to rcablecutting
television,not_removed,agreed
television,not_removed,nope but i grew up having to wait a week or more for new episodes and to a little kid a week is forever so having to wait a week or even a month does not bother me
television,not_removed,after experiencing viewing a show on a regular weekly basis vs binging several episodes at a time i can say that binging makes the experience less enjoyable for a few reasons suspense and anticipation are two big experiential elements that are designed and written into these shows and binging effectively removes those experiences you dont allow yourself to process and digest and imagine the possible outcomes you simply let the show play the next episode and that lack of a few days worth of pause doesnt allow you to reset yourself emotionally and psychologically to take another roller coaster ride youre basically just going around and around the roller coaster again and again after a while you get desensitized to it and not only that youre not hungry for it anymore binging is a really accurate term for it youre just plowing through the consumption of these episodes for the sake of having consuming them i tried binging and i think it makes the show feel less entertaining and less interesting to watch it that way it loses a lot of its mystique in the process it loses a lot of its highs and lows youre just rushing to the end and that in tv shows is actually not the focus and goal of the writers its more about enjoying the now and giving out moments of value down with binging take the long way its better
television,not_removed,they have been doing this forever for suits it bugs the hell out of me but its so good i have to watch every week 😣
television,not_removed,i already stopped watching shows while the season is still running i hate having to wait for the next episode to continue the story and sometimes even having to wait for the midbreak now i wait until the season is done before finding a place where i can watch it all at my own pace another advantage of that is also no commercials i gave up regular tv for streaming years ago and havent looked back for exactly those reasons
television,not_removed,most of the shows i have been really enjoying lately are netflix or hbo so yes i have pretty much made the transition
television,not_removed,i enjoy all my entertainment video games movies tv shows etc much later everyone is so fixated on the next new thing to delve into so i typically unless im passionate about it wait it out that said the biggest issue ive had with binging tv shows is that people love to spoil them i mean its fashionable to be the piece of shit who posts spoiler memes all over their facebook and expects you should just be up to date with it point and case was the walking dead i still enjoy bingeing shows but people make that difficult also it sucks to wait so damn long to find out what happens i recommend binging
television,not_removed,already there i cant follow stories anymore if i have to wait a week i lose interest way too fast
television,not_removed,i cant stand all the breaks how does anyone watch their favorite show without dvr or hulu unless you actively keep up with your favorite shows schedules online you have absolutely no idea whether it will be on during any given week i cut the cord and ill never go back i do miss having conversations on reddit with fans about shows in real time but giving that up was worth the headache saved from the networks crap
television,not_removed,thats why i do both i am a big flash fan so i cant help but watch weekly but when the season is over i like to binge it as soon as it pops on netflix
television,not_removed,im with you not because of the midseason breaks but because of the midepisode ones with the last episode of twd i recorded i watched minutes of show any fast forwarded through minutes of commercials totally kills the vibe of the show no pun intended id rather wait a year and binge it on netflix
television,not_removed,honestly it doesnt bother me that much anymore back in the day when you had to check the printed listings in the newspaper or the tv guide to see if your show was a rerun or otherwise preempted it was a pain in the ass now i have a dvr to record what i want to watch automatically and a zillion websites to tell me whats on and when there are almost never any surprises and given the firehose of good content the various entertainment entities are producing these days theres always something else to watch i kinda look forward to the hiatus periods they give me a chance to catch up on or try other stuff that i dont have time for during the regular tv season
television,not_removed,yes been doing this for years
television,not_removed,when did this become a thing just got cable back and its ridiculous trying to watch designated survivor i didnt realize it was a lot of shows
television,not_removed,ive been waiting for seasons to complete on shows for years now and make few exceptions got is one such exception because addiction reasons but the list of shows that compelling is rickdiculiously small rick and morty ofc qualify as well i never have to sit or skip through commercials and when i pick up a new season its bingeheaven its much better if you can be patient and enjoy the narratives on your terms
television,not_removed,nbc did this for the first few seasons of grimm i stopped watching live and had to wait for dvds it became so bad im pretty sure they had different month long breaks on top of the week holliday break network television needs better executives to survive the current model is pathetic
television,not_removed,i stopped watching television in dont even own one best thing ever
television,not_removed,after the shitshow that is american programming my shows ended up bumped nearly a month because of world series superbowl and elections after this season ill wait until i dont have to deal with their ineptude again
television,not_removed,i did this years ago now i dont watch a show until its complete series run and i can get some confidence that its worth my time also it saves me from spoilers i wont know who glenn is in years
television,not_removed,can confirm i only watch seasons when finished
television,not_removed,you know you can do that with a little will power and self control it sucks ill admit but thats what i do
television,not_removed,yep binge watching is pretty much what we do now i dont understand why the networks havent figured out that people dont want the strange patterns couple of weeks on week off holiday breaks oh lets try a random time slot and then they cancel new shows and wonder why they dont get viewers
television,not_removed,i havent waited to be spoonfed episodes in so long now that i can never go back these huge gaps make me lose interest and not even bother a lot of times as well
television,not_removed,i watch a few shows weekly like the twd westworld etc however i also enjoy the cw super hero shows so ive kept all of the dc superhero shows on my pvr being queued so that during the christmas break ill have something to watch since there are shows thats a decent amount ill have to fiddle with the ratio of course but thats what ive been doing so far this year there are other shows im watchingqueuing but you know i didnt want to go too far in depth with it
television,not_removed,i do this exact thing with walking dead
television,not_removed,yup unless it is a really good show i just wait until its overas in the series i just get tired of waiting
television,not_removed,tbh i forgot people still watch shows week to week i havent done that since breaking bad and even then it was only the last season when i was able to binge watch up to current its a fools game watching regular tv
television,not_removed,i wouldnt say that i completely give up on watching weekly but i do find myself unintentionally skipping a few weeks and then catching on on the dvr all at once
television,not_removed,yep
television,not_removed,yup
television,not_removed,the walkin dead is the worst with their breaks especially since they constantly have about different storylines going on its so hard to remember who the fuck anybody is or what theyre up to
television,not_removed,i gave up on program tv around
television,not_removed,im seriously considering skipping the rest of doctor who and just bingewatching when im this a dozen episodes every two years crap is annoying
television,not_removed,yup i do this with literally every show i watch its way more enjoyable this way
television,not_removed,yes i dont watch anything current at all im in the middle of dexter right now and its pretty damn good
television,not_removed,i havent owned cable since like
television,not_removed,im even worse i only watch after the series finale my only exceptions are loweffort bravo reality series or light comedies
television,not_removed,this is one of the biggest of the first world problems
television,not_removed,thats all i do especially with the more complex shows many hbo ones i pvr the whole season and start near the end time to start watching westworld
television,not_removed,its always obnoxious but the worst is when they hold back the series finale arc for months like breaking bad and mad men amc is terrible about this and part of me hopes one of these series finales arcs gets leaked months before the air date so they reconsider the strategy
television,not_removed,i remember lost being particularly egregious with this the second season ran from september to may by randomly skipping weeks throughout the season the longest stretch of episodes was only the first five weeks of the show you never knew when the show was going to be on or not because there was no rhyme nor reason to when new episode would air i mean just look at the dates for the second half of the season personally id much rather have a longer midseason break if it means we get longer stretches of backtoback episodes at least i can use a couple month break in the middle of the season to catch up on other shows on netflix and amazon
television,not_removed,its even weirder when youre not based in the us and you dont even know why shows are randomly not on one week and back the next
television,not_removed,exactly i love greys anatomy dont judge me and a few years ago my wife and i would sit down to watch it together the worst would be coming home preparing to relax and watch an episode only to find that its a rerun or that its just not airing sometimes it was even on during a different time slot or a different day we gave up on watching most tv as it aired and just let the pvr collect the shows for viewing at a later time now that we have a kid we might just cut the cord entirely and subsist off of netflix and amazon prime
television,not_removed,agents of shield did that in seasons and when there was another marvel show to take its slot in january to march each half was structured like a full season by itself this year it seems like were getting three or so shorter seasons
television,not_removed,they still do that and even with half a season of episodes they still cancel midway through hannibal they change the scheduling date its always sunny in philadelphia they get so caught up buying fake golden globes they forget to make the correct number of episodes and have to cut it short american horror story hotel and they still cannot deliver a decent final season to save their lives dexter and yet their tired generic reboots still find a way to suck even harder heroes reborn nothing has changed
television,not_removed,the worst are cartoons like bobs burgers and adventuretime that are literally impossible to figure out when the hell there are new episodes adventuretime had episodes regularly in may then one in june then one in july then the season finale in november but then theyll show episodes in a week or show an episode in brazil first its like theyre just throwing darts at a dartboard
television,not_removed,agreed i gave up on that as soon as netflix started to become a standard years ago i prefer focusing on one show at a time now then moving onto the next the only show i watch per week is got and at least with hbo you get consistency
television,not_removed,just started the simpsons not leaving until im done
television,not_removed,considering theres episodes its ok to be a bit behind on that show
television,not_removed,
television,not_removed,i wait just started twilight zone
television,not_removed,a couple of years ago i went through the barney miller episodes only the first season of police story is available on disc naked city is one of the great series that that isnt well known know at all
television,not_removed,i was so freaked out when gilmore girls ayitlo came out because i couldnt watch it right away but not a peep on my timeline even though a lot of my friends were equally invested you know what netflix viewers dont do spoil shit for others
television,not_removed,i cant watch twd live because of the constant commercials but you also cant wait more than hrs to watch it or it will be spoiled so we watch westworld live at no commercials thank you hbo and dvr twd that also airs at and watch it at ff the commercials
television,not_removed,add westworld
television,not_removed,jump on westworld you wont regret it
television,not_removed,the walking dead is the worst showthat i watch every week
television,not_removed,i do that with flash instead of got
television,not_removed,so do people just not talk with one another anymore westworld has absolutely consumed our office and the week between episodes is filled with our theories and discussions about the show same with got when its running really makes these shows that much more enjoyable imo one of us inevitably picks up on something everyone else missed
television,not_removed,the walking dead lost me with a midseason break season or was bad in my opinion and when the midseason break came in i just never came back
television,not_removed,this is fucking killing me i dont think its a bad show and am generally intrigued to see how it plays out but i swear to god one more two week break and i am going to lose it
television,not_removed,try keeping up with bobs burgers heres last years air dates sep oct oct nov nov jan feb feb mar mar apr apr apr apr apr may may may may double episodes following barren weeks and when it returned after christmas they just put one episode on and then waited another month
television,not_removed,abc is also the biggest offender in requiring hulu to show commercials im consciously trying to avoid starting any new shows by them
television,not_removed,this so much this they would never pull this shit on jack bauer but meek president kiefer is getting hosed
television,not_removed,its on hulu its actually a good show so far
television,not_removed,i can agree with you i watch this and quantico and both of them have been like this quantico just got to mid season and wont air again till late january i believe
television,not_removed,try watching that show from europe episodes are added to my netflix after theyre aired in the us but i have basically given up guessing as to when at least in the us you at least know why they skip the episodes
television,not_removed,im glad im not the only one that noticed this i very rarely watch tv live anymore and usually just catch up on shows online its incredibly frustrating when i sit down to watch the new episode only to find out it didnt air this week like what the fuck its a pretty decent show too but how do you expect people to keep watching it when you cant even keep a consistent schedule
television,not_removed,its kind of annoying as a british viewer where its a netflix exclusive it says new episodes every week but every week i tune in and there is no new episode makes me want to stop checking
television,not_removed,sounds like the curse of the firefly airing a new show inconsistently is a death wish
television,not_removed,its actually on netflix now and it follows the same release date this is one of those watch it on netflix the same day shows that have been going around
television,not_removed,im on the verge of bouncing out and binging it on netflix or prime when it comes out the beautiful irony is that in the uk netflix have done a deal to get the new episodes the day after they air in the us so i started binging it a few weeks ago unaware it was ongoing and that there would be so many breaks every week i have to manually check if there is a new episode and generally there isnt one
television,not_removed,i hate watch twd just because i know if i waited to watch it all at once at the end of the season to fast forward through the throwaway padding episodes the good ones would be spoiled by the internet anyway and make it pointless if i wasnt so invested already i would drop twd so hard at least episodes a season that could have been completely cut without affecting the plot at all andor torture porn sigh
television,not_removed,twd is a perfect example why week by week is dying ill wait for full season to binge like almost all shows
television,not_removed,i also prefer watching something week to week i like event television and taking time to appreciate one episode at a time read recaps and discussions and have my own discussions about what has happened and what will happen its part of the culture of television binge viewing has spoiled people with their i want it all now mentality and people rush through shows and forget half of what happened a week later or simply dont appreciate what went into a show because theyre not spending weeks or months becoming invested its all one and done now for every show that ive binged to catch up on ive enjoyed the new season that i catch live much more i just think its a purer experience for the medium than treating it like a consumable product and moving onto the next thing
television,not_removed,i love netflix shows because they dont try to conform to some bullshit ad break ad break ad break structure and they dont have to always give you a cliff hanger at the end of every episode because the makers know that youll probably watch anyway i agree with you on week to week though as a cultural thing its nice to talk to people about the show and speculate it enhances the enjoyment game of thrones is great for this because there are so many people watching it
television,not_removed,it depends on the show i definitely feel this way for some shows but others are good to binge
television,not_removed,hour long episode dramas are fucking insane comes across as the only show that would benefit from it but thats way too much for a drama
television,not_removed,have you watched this season of the walking dead its story episodes season pilot and mid season final and the rest is filler
television,not_removed,i prefer the old way my favorite series all were episode seasons the stargates andromeda star treks supernatural the new episode seasons suck ass because they take just as long to air have the same time between seasons have mid season breaks and have half the content
television,not_removed,i agree pretty much i like the better writing in the shorter seasons but i also dislike the random month long breaks between episodes that happen
television,not_removed,sounds like you just watched bad shows cw knows how to keep a show paced for episodes vampire diaries and the originals and supernatural are all episode seasons and have next to no filler great pacing always advancing story always developing characters
television,not_removed,what about the walking dead we are still getting mid season breaks less episodes and episodes of filler
television,not_removed,doing that is just asking for someone to tell you that barry fucked up the timeline again and ended up killing bernard while protecting dolores from teddy spoilers man fucking people cant keep that shit in
television,not_removed,i think was doing really well with the new direction after break thing too i get bored with many shows now because i simply dont care about the characters
television,not_removed,me irl well my extended family sucks but at least i can watch oh also christmas does not take months channukka takes like weeks wtf is this winter break based on
television,not_removed,i feel the same theres so much content on the internet shows i didnt catch when they originally aired or were aired in other countries that when a current show is on break i just switch to something else granted i only watch hours of tv a day so i dont often lack for something to watch in fact i usually have a backlog on the dvr and im not fond of bingewatching two episodes backtoback is my limit and i prefer once a week spacing
television,not_removed,those commercials pay for your show to exist
television,not_removed,shit dude lol binging doesnt mean literally watching for hours in a row it typically means hours or more even with some small breaks in between then picking it up the next day
television,not_removed,but you have the option to watch it when you want thats the point
television,not_removed,yeah the wife and i usually watch episodes max then switch to something else like going to bed because were old
television,not_removed,binging is really just focusing on one or two shows at a time my wife binged gilmore girls over the course of like a year most of our tv viewing time went to that its not actually sitting in front of a tv for eight straight hours
television,not_removed,im kinda the same except i dont lose interest when binging a bunch of episodes i just feel like i hardly retain anything it all becomes one giant episode in my head and i cant remember what order things happened in i find a week or two no more than that bc my brain is like sieve between epis gives me time to digest what ive seen and like you i look forward to the next one
television,not_removed,lack of commercials is amazing why would you pay to watch commercials if you dont have to
television,not_removed,the released a fixed ending for how i met your mother so your friend should definitely watch it
television,not_removed,himym is a comedy though just because i didnt like how they ultimately wrapped things up doesnt mean that i didnt laugh my ass off along the way
television,not_removed,only
television,not_removed,they pretty much did with fear the walking dead
television,not_removed,of how a group of canadians or minnesotans same thing
television,not_removed,rnhlstreams fair warning though the redwings are garbage
television,not_removed,the great thing about pbs is when cartoons are done for the day theyre done less whining because the kiddo knows nobody can make dt come back on just avoid the app the app is a dark place from which no toddler returns
television,not_removed,game of thrones is defiently a show that is better watched weekly most episodes are satisfying and crazy theories deaths and cliff hangers are better experienced with friends
television,not_removed,lost is the type of show that is improved by watching it as you go the water cooler theories were half the fun i would say that westworld is the same kind of show
television,not_removed,binge watching lost and breaking bad was pure awesomeness
television,not_removed,sonarr
television,not_removed,age has nothing to do with it im and am the same way going a step further i skip fox all together because they havehad two extended breaks october for the world series and then the winter break im alright with skipping a week here and there if a season is instead of episodes but huge time off paired with whats almost always a disappointing midseason cliffhanger makes me stop watching more times than not
television,not_removed,maybe you couldnt stop watching the shows you really liked
television,not_removed,sounds like a good idea personally i cant help myself if the show is really good i would probably enjoy got more if i binged it but i just cant not watch it knowing its out there
television,not_removed,i actually think theres a bigger spoiler risk watching week to week like i keep forgetting to unfollow some show pages when they hype everybody up for something new i have no idea why certain things are significant yet
television,not_removed,throw that ass back bitch yeah fuck me yeah yeah oh yeah baby thats good
television,not_removed,throw that ass back on my dick
television,not_removed,well there will be new doctor who in about days
television,not_removed,to avoid viewership dropping during the holiday season which seems pointless with the adoption of dvrs in the last years but they want maximum live viewers for advertisers
television,not_removed,hes not talking about watching live just watching each episode each week
television,not_removed,especially since they moved it to the bastardized death slot of football running over meh lets just start bobs burgers half way in or show the ot for an additional minutes networks feel like theyre light years behind the rest of the entertainment industry
television,not_removed,got my math a little wrong on my first attempt at this comment but yeah the scheduling for this show drives me crazy starting a season late hoping to have a nice few eps ready only to find fox has aired new episodes in the last or weeks is frustrating
television,not_removed,there was a single use website the url of which i forget but it was something like islostnewtonightcom because people never really knew if it was a new episode or not but to be fair from season on theyd run janmay and almost every week was new
television,not_removed,meanwhile season was in arcs episodes and episodes that ran straight through ended up being a mistake because not much happened but was a huge success season only took a break due to the writers strike looking at dates seasons and took oneweek break each
television,not_removed,i remember there was a lot of backlash because of that season the last three seasons of lost ended up with every episode being aired without breaks starting in late winter and ending in may
television,not_removed,i reeeally thought you hid the numbers in there somewhere but ive stared myself blind i give up
television,not_removed,i think lost was the one that showed network execs they could pull this kind of shit without a ratings hit
television,not_removed,we care about baseball so you have to care about baseball edit this joke did not go over as clearly as i hoped edit im clearly still sad about firefly
television,not_removed,it was really bad with that for a while this season i dont think they had a single break in episodes until now winter mid season break or whatever
television,not_removed,are we done with this amazing ghost rider arc because id really like to get back to that inhuman bullshit weve been dealing with for years
television,not_removed,each half was structured like a full season by itself was it really like that i dont remember that i know thats what gotham does now one villian first hald bigger villian next half
television,not_removed,thats mainly because they need to keep in schedule with the movies tbh imagine if they had delivered the midseason twist in season one week earlier clashing with the winter soldiers release chaos right now its better because all they have to worry about is getting all the tv show stars ready for their cameos in avengers infinity wars part ii
television,not_removed,stop whatever you are doing right now get on hbo and start watching westworld you can thank me later
television,not_removed,me too it just sucks you have to wait a year for the next season of a network show to come out on netflix
television,not_removed,first seasons youll like after that meh i doubt youll finish awake that is
television,not_removed,i knew what the spoiler was before i even moused over and it still hit me like a ton of bricks
television,not_removed,now im sad
television,not_removed,probably because a whole season is released at once with week to week shows its easy to get caught up in the hype after an episode airs if the whole season is plopped down in front of you you know others likely arent where you are at in the show and thus are less likely to spoil my theory anyway
television,not_removed,i both like and dislike this i will talk with people at work on monday morning about twd and westworld but ive never had a conversation with anyone about house of cards because everyone is always at a different episode if we go to every show being netflix style ill miss being able to talk to people about it not just in person either rwestworld theorising is great fun
television,not_removed,the binge is common practice with netflix and ive never had a show spoiled people seem sensitive that it takes people different amounts of time but when its weekly the old patterns of talking about the latest episode continues its interesting to consider the cultural reasons why
television,not_removed,is this some kind of westworld paid advertising thread op mentions it and countless people are mentioning it in the comments for no real reason
television,not_removed,i jumped on regretted it quite early and i officially gave up weeks ago they put mystery above all else including making me care for any of the characters
television,not_removed,the show gets good ratings at fox and yet the treat the show like a red headed step child
television,not_removed,to be fair im pretty sure that the octobernovember gap was due to the baseball playoffs
television,not_removed,barren weeks one hamburger please any toppings no just a burger please ketchup mustar no thanks just a burger one barren burger coming up
television,not_removed,that explains why it seems so random on my dvr christ i never knew they were mid season ill go ahead and wait for it all to be on hulu
television,not_removed,they also aired a couple christmasthemed episodes out of order last year didnt they
television,not_removed,oh its because of our existing contracts were so sorry but please ignore that were going to continue to do it for any popular shows that come out
television,not_removed,have you noticed hes only meek around his close advisers and in public then he takes out the army boss and cuts down the ambassador from distantistan like hes vincent from collateral
television,not_removed,haha going through the same bs with mexican netflix
television,not_removed,yeah thats how i feel ive invested seasons worth of time so the least i can do is wait until rick eventually dies before giving up
television,not_removed,yeah twd is so annoying the season opener was like just tell me who died i dont even care that much and then they go and make a big deal of it ive distanced myself emotionally because i just dont care they need to end it
television,not_removed,i dropped it after terminus then i came back after midseason before negan and caught up the show still felt like filler content until the inevitable big death so i just cant get back into itm love the comics though
television,not_removed,ive decided to only watch the series premiere mid season finale mid season premiere and season finale from now on
television,not_removed,gave up on twd dont enjoy watching anymore but i dont know why
television,not_removed,comes across as the only show that would benefit from it but thats way too much for a drama had a lot of filler in it that made me wince often jack had to disobey some authority figure too many times he was a decorated hero and they always treated him like a retard it was beyond stupid i say that as a huge fan of the series it isnt perfect
television,not_removed,i definately agree with you for serial dramas for comedies and or procedurals i say put out as many as you think you can do well and worm towards those magic syndication dollars
television,not_removed,this is why i gave up on gotham i made it through season but i didnt have the fortitude to sit through another hours of it for season
television,not_removed,its been like this since the beginning although it has gotten worse i dont understand why people still watch that show its not terrible and i watch an episode every now and again if im at a friends house and he has it on tv but its absolutely not worth me going out of my way to have cable or pay for episodes
television,not_removed,they are already to the mid season ffs
television,not_removed,this is how twd has been since day give or take maybe one extra real episode per half
television,not_removed,the first episode of the season is a season premiere theres only one pilot and its the very first episode of the series
television,not_removed,its not filler at all it expands and lets people get to know the characters so when bad shit happens people actually care if the characters die
television,not_removed,shows like star trek can be episodes though because theyre separate complete stories each episode with some overarching character building i think it really depends on the show format tbh
television,not_removed,tbh i prefer high quality engaging fillerless episodes to halfandhalf filler episodes are the bane of my tvwatching life if the ratio gets too low i will drop a show regardless of how good the good episodes are most recent example is walking dead
television,not_removed,woah someone mentioning andromeda and i thought stargate references were rare ive been meaning to rewatch andromeda but im not sure if i love rade enough to tough out
television,not_removed,you are describing episodic vs arc each show a whole complete segment vs each show leading into the next in a long overall arc
television,not_removed,i also dislike the random month long breaks between episodes that happen i wish more networks would do fall and winter seasons separately with episode seasons have show a fill the slot for the fall season then show b can fill the slot for the winter season
television,not_removed,writers used to know the art of writing both a self contained mini story and a cliffhanger now it seems like each episode is finishing the last episodes cliffhanger and introducing a new one and if the small storylines are there at all theyre weak
television,not_removed,i definitely disagree the only cw show ive seen that wasnt filler is the has shorter seasons
television,not_removed,damn dawg you dont spend every night in december playing scrabble with your family and then drinking cocoa while staring into the fireplace with all the lights turned off
television,not_removed,the break isnt for the viewers its for the show creators
television,not_removed,i read that line in mr plinkets voice xd
television,not_removed,sounds like studios need to get their shit together this idea that people should adjust to how entertainment is made for them is retarded either make it the way we want or fuck off well it got cancelled because you didnt watch it well we didnt watch it because viewing habits arent the same as years ago dumb shit
television,not_removed,hey im not investing in a story that could easily be cancelled so either make a good show and put it on every week with no breaks or continue to cancel its no sweat off my back
television,not_removed,as does the money we pay the cable company as does the money netflix hulu amazon and other streaming providers pay to air the shows as does the money other countries pay for the syndication of that show while commercials are part of the revenue stream they are certainly not the only part of it in the end it all comes out of the consumers pocket we pay for stuff at macys which uses the money we gave them to pay for the production of a commercial and to pay the cable company to air the commercial on its channel in turn the cable company uses the money that macys paid which was revenue from sales ie consumer money and revenue from selling their service cable subscriptions that the consumer pays for to pay the producers of a movietv show for the right to show it on their channel basically in the end we pay twice or three times for the shows we are able to watch on tv netflixamazon etc we pay the cable company our monthly fees which they use to buy the material and we pay for the servicesgoods at the companies that use our money to pay for commercialssyndication and sometimes we pay for merchandise of the specific showmovie on top of that
television,not_removed,hello i couldnt help but notice your comment unfortunately ill have to ask you to not make such comments in the future you see netflix enjoys a healthy acceptance on reddit and this community appears to be ripe for planted comments and marketing this has presented an exciting opportunity for netflix to advertise freely and raise public imageperception unfortunately your comment has interrupted this chain and we must ask that you delete it in a timely manner thank you the netflix team
television,not_removed,i would even suggest that bingeing might be watching one or two episodes a day everyday though and then moving on the next show when finished the first
television,not_removed,i thought an episode a day was considered binging hours a day would be called nolifing it
television,not_removed,because i dont pay to watch commercials tv is free
television,not_removed,hey i totally agree i disliked the ending but enjoyed the journey there
television,not_removed,i have no idea how himym ends really except that its supposed to suck and ive never seen the pilot or shows back to back but i enjoy each episode i see anyway
television,not_removed,did you watch the seinfeld finale though that was a rough one
television,not_removed,it used to have agent carter inbetween but not anymore
television,not_removed,yeah but im talking about a closed ended story like the prison battle from the original series as an entire arc the wd world is already established why not just a four part movie of a group of survivors defending their stronghold against another group think of it as one long movie not a six episode tv show it could basically be the story of the alamo but with survivors fighting off a post apocalyptic biker gang and some zombies you can basically steal and retool any classic action movie add some zombies and take advantage of the fact that you have already trained your audience to accept the setting and rules of the wd universe if you spend part one and two developing characters and introducing the circumstances that brought them into conflict with a nemesis then you can spend four parts four hours having an epic battle that cancome to a satisfying conclusion closing the story and leaving the audience with a true ending and possibly leaving this cast available for a sequel next year if the audience clamors for it same thing but survivors are safe on an island in the great lakes and have to fight off pirates or minnesota or wisconsin so we can battle the rough winter conditions and zombies my point is that there are endless ways to take advantage of the wd universe in short story arcs
television,not_removed,is that show any good i tried twd but i couldnt get through the season on the farm
television,not_removed,fear the walking dead is absolute trash they even took away the badass intro
television,not_removed,i finally caught up so that i can do this for season and
television,not_removed,lost is not at all the show that improved by watching as you go i mean for the first seasons it is the hatch through ought the entirety of season was thrilling and got better and better in season where sawyer and kate are in those polar bear cages watching it on tv was bad because it took up so much time the show never really got its consistency back after that it was spotty starting season and that continued until the series finale
television,not_removed,on dvd futurama has four seasons that were broadcast on fox on tv there were five go look at the column television order on httpsenwikipediaorgwikilistoffuturamaepisodes and marvel at the shit futurama fans had to endure
television,not_removed,so theyre giving it the futurama treatment god dammit fox that was literally the only show on network tv that i actually enjoyed
television,not_removed,i hate bobs time slot they gave fucking zorn a better slot bobs has been new every other week since the season premier its like fox is trying to kill the show
television,not_removed,i didnt watch it when it was live but thread on ign says it was httpislostarepeatcom
television,not_removed,hm as someone in the uk we got lost weekly consistently once it had finished airing for you guys i had no idea that season was split like that both release wise and plot wise
television,not_removed,was the one with kate and sawyer in the cages cause i remember watching that week to week and it was interminable
television,not_removed,seasons and and had a week break each season took a break from march to april due to the writers strike i believe the intent was to go straight through
television,not_removed,every show used to do that that was just how network tv was run networks need episodes to last weeks so taking breaks and showing reruns was the only way to do it lost was actually one of the first network shows to move to airing the show weekly towards the end of its run
television,not_removed,thats just not cricket
television,not_removed,yeah it seems like they went on mid season break a few weeks earlier than usual which allowed them to air backtoback episodes all throughout septemberoctobernovember i definitely prefer this over how its been done in the past
television,not_removed,the inhuman arc is ongoing the next thing theyll tackle will likely be the lmds but well still be dealing with inhumans through it
television,not_removed,full spoilers for marvels agents of shield below yeah the writing and production actually follows a pattern like that as well they had several months off before going in production for the back half of the season when binge watching it might not come across like this but the arcs are defined rebuilding shield facing hydra big bad is whitehall season finale was the reveal of daisy johnson inhumans big bad was jiaying new mission for the team finding inhumans before the atcu can big bad was gideon malick the hive storyline
television,not_removed,maybe not a mid season break but i believe i read westworld season wont be coming out until me if i am wrong
television,not_removed,its next on the list ive heard great things looking forward to diving in when work travel slows down for me in a couple of weeks
television,not_removed,im going to wait until game of thrones is back airing so i can bum off my friends dads account
television,not_removed,its a perfectly cromulent show
television,not_removed,rewatched it a few years ago from first to last its very surreal all of the jokes about iraq and bush are still funny when thinking about gw all of the jokes really are still applicable even the iran jokes weve made so little progress as a nation its honestly hilarious
television,not_removed,shallow and pedantic
television,not_removed,my fellow redditor take my advice pull down your pants and slide on the ice
television,not_removed,i think its like books i can easily devour a great book and still have discussions ship characters and otherwise read between the plot lines i poke at my friends to catch up or trade recommendations or give them that sly i wont spoil this for you but wait till you get to chapter grin you can also make a commitment to only watch with somebody else
television,not_removed,i agreei felt this way with stranger things while it was great being able to binge imagine how much suspense there would have been if the episodes aired on a week by week basis i know for me the most suspensful part was when s nancy went into the upsidedown through the tree and jonathan couldnt help her and it happened right at the end of an episode imagine having to wait a week to see what happens i know i would have gone to work and speculated about that entire season with my coworkers some of the fun is lost of course i love binging shows but some of the fun is lost when you cant speculate from episode to episode
television,not_removed,yeah when house of cards comes out everybody asks what episode are you on before talking about the show with game of thrones they just assume youre watching it as it comes out
television,not_removed,its really good
television,not_removed,they are all excited because the first season has been amazing so far and the finale is the only episode left the wait is killing them so this thread is more relevant for rwestworld than probably every other active show in hindsight most would like to binge it at once but at the same time do not want spoilers
television,not_removed,countless people are mentioning it in the comments for no real reason its because it is partway through the first series at the moment so it is topical to this thread
television,not_removed,it doesnt look like anything to me
television,not_removed,doesnt look like anything to me
television,not_removed,its just a good show
television,not_removed,the westworld is slow to start but by episode it really picks up and now im into it there
television,not_removed,thats fox for you they treat their best shows that they air the worst
television,not_removed,it does well on netflix but they just want a new comedy to replace it so they have a reason to cancel it they did this shit to king of the hill and people are still raving about that show
television,not_removed,and football and holidays and whatever the fuck else
television,not_removed,yes two characters had their second date one week then they met for the first time the next week
television,not_removed,samesies i feel like im in an unhealthy relationship with twd but im sticking with it a bit longer its time they cure the zombie virus and deal with the aftermath though i know the comics still go on
television,not_removed,i felt the same way now if i am super curious which i dont then to be i just readwatch a review on it if it is a good episode i will skip to the good part but watching a whole episode is too much
television,not_removed,same here i watched the opener and the second episode but while watching i realized that i had just stopped caring i sort of avoid spoilers online in case i feel like returning to it one day but with the massive amount of other content out there i just find its not interesting enough anymore
television,not_removed,thats not a bad strategy i may try that next season
television,not_removed,jacks daughter encountering a puma and a creepy survivalist guy in the woods come to mind and nothing happened she literally sees the puma or whatever a couple of times and the puma doesnt give a fuck and the creepy guy just lets her go or makes some halfhearted attempt to grab her
television,not_removed,my recollection is that the first halfdozen or so episodes of a season were quite well thoughtout and wellpaced but then would lose their way and get farfetched seemed to me that the writers had carefully outlined about that much of the story when the season started and then had to quickly write the rest of it once filming began
television,not_removed,butbut theres no time
television,not_removed,i really dont understand the hype around this show i watched the first season and everything about it was just so mediocre
television,not_removed,its a better binge imo
television,not_removed,the problem is episodes like last weeks where nothing much really happens and worse nothing in the episode matters at all it would be better if they could integrate the character building stuff with the main storyline but instead they bookend the seasons with a couple of exciting episodes and then we get six hours in the middle of meaningless escapades and forgettable new characters well never revisit
television,not_removed,nope its pure filler remember all the episodes where maggie lamented the loss of her dear sister yeah me neither that would be perfect for character development instead we get the same drawn out the way the world used to be and the way the world is now is different dialogue almost all the time and if its not that its just a character repeating what i could have done to prevent x y or z happening and i didnt we dont need that we dont need whole episodes where characters are just bugging their eyes out and making a minute monologue into a whole minute monologue followed by a minute commercial break its filler
television,not_removed,i agree with you and thats my argument havent even touched this season though but season geez i think the farm one good gravy that was boring to grind it was worth it because huge character archs but damn what a chore now that said i think the walking dead has a problem other intense shows are going to have at some point game of thrones even when things get epic they are epic fans enjoy those epic moments the problem here is you cant pack that much epic without the character development and this leads to problems like the current rating drop or the farm season the last season of twd the one on netflix now not tv was action packed out the gate and didnt really ever calm down all the protagonists were on their a game and the group were succeeding at everything that momentum has to crash at some point and twd is the kind of show where the group cannot be impenetrable they have to get knocked down and suffer so that the epic moments are epic the problem lies in how its written when theyre down there has to be some sort of redemption intensity the farm season had so very little it built for more amazing scenes in future episodes sure but getting through it was just not tremendously fun i think the problem with twd is that it cant maintain the momentum and also that fans dont realize that because some seasons can maintain it at a certain point though things have to die down and build back up
television,not_removed,we get to know the characters and then towards the finale they act out of character for the sake of the plot outside of rick daryl maggie and michonne there isnt a character that i find likable enough to care if they died or not eugene has a decent arc carls actor found out how to act somewhere along the way so its interesting to see him improve but the character is still not a plus the show isnt terrible though the hate against it isnt that justified probably due to jealousy that such an average show has gotten massive ratings while their beloved cult hit probably some nbc show got the axe
television,not_removed,like last season of izombie episodes iirc with a few filler episodes at the beginning to lull you into the seasons plot it was a good length imo
television,not_removed,the episode arcs back in the dbz days come to mind good god the amount of filler makes it tough to rewatch
television,not_removed,i liked rade though i need to finish season five i started a re watch a few years back but only made it a few episodes into because that shit just confuses me i could also go more rare and bring up crusade i really liked that show too however it was only episodes so i didnt include it in my post
television,not_removed,i dont mind the filler episodes on supernatural times out of theyre still better than of everything else on tv
television,not_removed,whats wrong with monster of the week stuff i love that shit you meet interesting side characters an intriguing creature gore and development of the relationship between the two brothers supernatural lost me when they began to focus entire episodes on the seasons overall plot like the leviathan shit or the angels warring each other i dont mind getting episodes dedicated to advancing a season arc persay but i prefer if the main plot elements are sprinkled in with standalone episodes
television,not_removed,exactly just because most of us plebs dont get weeks and weeks of vacation time doesnt mean wealthy people dont either
television,not_removed,yes and id love as a nonamerican to be able to count towards statistics unfortunately most of the time the only way i could watch tvshows legitimately while they are airing is to use illegal means id pay for the opportunity to watch it on the networks own websites and count towards the statsratings
television,not_removed,im just waiting so i can binge my dvr in a few months doesnt mean much when viewers fast forward through their advertisements you know who watches dopey commercials fans who watch dopey cookie cutter shows like everything on the cbs network except poi
television,not_removed,networks are free they make money from advertisements there best they can do other than do ops block scheduling but it was extra messed up this year with presidential election debates and night coverage
television,not_removed,some of the streaming services have figured out how to release whole seasons at once
television,not_removed,exactly it i know a show will never be finished in a satisfactory way i wont start it the pressure is on to provide a quality ending for late viewers as well luckily netflix is picking up some slack there
television,not_removed,i agree id rather see a show with potential get cancelled if im not watching it so to prevent that possibility i generally only watch shows that are either not getting cancelled any time soon or ones with contained stories that it doesnt matter if it gets cancelled
television,not_removed,thank you im glad to see im not the only one when the new season of black mirror came out i was talking to people who had watched the entire season that very night i just cant do that episodes tops is a rarity
television,not_removed,i dont consider an episode a day a binge the word implies that youre taking in enough of a tv show that it could be considered unhealthy
television,not_removed,okay i see what you mean that would be pretty genius actually
television,not_removed,ive never seen the show but i could see how people would be into that
television,not_removed,i like it but i also love the original despite lots of recent criticism i have watched twd since day and religiously ever since honestly the show after the farm grows so much and things start happening quickly you should try it again as for ftwd i sometimes miss my characters but i know all about the world already so its an interesting perspective having knowledge that these new characters dont
television,not_removed,we are kind of back to the farm right now what i mean is that the problem with the farm season was all of the storyand character development and lack of story movement or action right now we have had six straight stand alone bottle episodes they are all telling necessary story and plot points but there is no action and the story is at a standstill the first half of this season reminds me of the farm
television,not_removed,dont its all the drama of the farm and then some more slow slogging drama
television,not_removed,it depends on personal experiences imo for me id say more than half of the enjoyment i got out of lost was going into work the next day and talking about all the crazy theories and hidden easter eggs that came up between that and the internet discussions each episode was good for a few days of entertainment at least i tried to go back and rewatch lost again not too long ago and it just didnt feel the same to me
television,not_removed,cough cough firefly sports night sliders bones cough cough
television,not_removed,forever
television,not_removed,yup while the eko episode was significant and the premiere was cool it was all a little tedious
television,not_removed,yes that was the intent serialized television starting with and lost was changing the network television landscape and it has changed forever since people were fed up with the week or multi week breaks they tried to address this in season with having the pods of episodes but people got annoyed at the they were handed in the beginning of season the writers have later said they felt like they were locked in cages themselves until they had a clear end date for the show they wanted to do more seasons of episodes each but negotiated with abc to do seasons of running straight through in the winter to spring it would be event television and something to anticipate all year the writers strike screwed all of that up and they ended up doing in season with a big break season and ended up with hours eachthe series finale ended up being hours including lots of commercials so we got a little extra i think the new format that networks are sticking with makes sense run most of the batch of episodes in halves or do shorter half seasons and run in the fall or the spring basically they still are running on the antiquated ratings system where sweeps periods are still important they need successful long running shows to help kick off their new fall shows in september they need to air very special episodes in november and february for sweeps and they need to have big end of season episodes in may for sweeps in the traditional tv landscape that led to many breaks during the year in october december january april but that led to complaints when highly serialized tv shows took off in the now binge watching has added a whole new level of complaints to the mix hence this thread i guess its all up to personal preference these days how you choose to watch your shows wait for a whole batch to binge watch week to week abandon the cord all together and just stream entire series on netflix hulu amazon etc you just miss out on that post dayweek online watercooler discussion but you can always search for those discussions after the fact whilst being wary of spoilers tldr serialized television changed viewer demands in the and lost tried to accommodate running into issues along the way binge television added even more frustration to the mix now people are on their own to determine how they want to watch sorry nice name btw and mattyzooks didnt mean to write all this in response to your comments specifically
television,not_removed,yeah we know its more like rounders
television,not_removed,yeah but the story are continuations unlike gotham which theyre more or less totally different storylines and if you wanted to can classify them as entirely different seasons i guess you are right just that gotham does it to a bigger extent granted that was last season i dont think they will do it that much this season
television,not_removed,im not sure why you were downvoted it wont be back until youre right and to reiterate what op said he should stop whatever it is they are doing and start watching west world hell thank us
television,not_removed,making us wait over a year for the next season who do they think they are rick and morty
television,not_removed,you are correct but no midseason break
television,not_removed,i conquer
television,not_removed,i agree shallow and pedantic
television,not_removed,if i was starting it now i couldnt help but binge through it yet watching it unfold episode by episode weekly while thinking about the plot and details reading discussions and theories has really enhanced the experience so for a rich complex series like this the release schedule works out great
television,not_removed,ah ok this makes sense i had never really heard of it before thats why it stuck out for me
television,not_removed,firefly
television,not_removed,i flat refused to watch this season im so done with the format fuck all happens in these shows shows like stranger things have shown me a fucking promised land rick going for a shit in the woods being dragged out over three episodes with a flashback to the last time he ate chili and a concurrent episode with the next new baddy of the season rubbing one out thinking about it have just worn me down twd isnt the only piece of shit guilty of it but its the pinnacle of it i understand that they drag the season out to sell advertising slots etc but the fact is its bad tv
television,not_removed,the whole puma thing is stupid theres literally no drama in being stalked by a puma you never see the puma if you are getting stalked by a puma and then you see the puma you are going to die thats pretty much it
television,not_removed,season one was supposed to be episodes but then fox extended the season to sutherland also said in interviews that every single season was written as they went where it never ended up where they thought it would
television,not_removed,yep same here what i found really odd about the show is that i kept waiting for some gimmick or anything niche that would set it aside from all the other postapocalyptic zombie stuff weve seen a thousand times before but it never came i mean whats the point of doing a zombie show in this day and age if youre not even going to attempt to put a new spin on the genre i get that its based off a graphic novel but still
television,not_removed,you raise some great points my wife and i started watching twd at the mid season marathon during ive stopped watching it and she just this week told me that it isnt doing it for her anymore i dont know for sure what the root cause is it does make me think of firefly a great series that many feel was cancelled too soon and whether there is a link between popularity and quality there probably isnt but it still makes me wonder and wish for just one more season of firefly rip shepherd aka ron glass
television,not_removed,from what i read the problem was that twd season had a really tight budget if i remember correctly their budget was slashed for mad men thats the only reason for the whole farmsophia plot it was super cheap amc only increased the budget a bit for season over season even though season had six episodes and season had episodes amc also requested that of all scenes be shot indoors the problem here is you cant pack that much epic without the character development see thats the problem for me with twd they add so many characters each season that they cant possibly develop them the way they have with characters that have been around longer most of the recent deaths just havent bothered me much with one big exception this season which should be obvious to any show watchers the problem for me is the filler episodes like last sundays episode im going to be intentionally vague to avoid spoilers but is that one guy dead i dont care really is the lady who was the focus going to rat out the group i dont care because i dont care about that new group they could have easily reduced the plot of the episode by and done some character development on existing characters so id give two shits about them
television,not_removed,i dont even care about rick i dont understand how he turned into the de facto leader hes an idiot but yeah agreed there are very few characters i care about at this point carol was one of my favorites but last season took a massive shit on her so eh well see also agree that while it isnt an amazing show its still pretty good
television,not_removed,season was nightmare mess of things and honestly i missed rommie and rommies boobs in i also always felt bad though about trading purple trance for gold tranceand yeah the quality was just kaput in the later seasons did you read the coda oh man now youre just bringing up all the nostalgia
television,not_removed,yeah take advantage of the world you have already built and the trust you have built with your audience in fact i thought after i wrote that comment why cant you have a group actually take over the actual alamo or some other old civil war era fort that has been kept up as a state monument somewhere the idea is at this point you can get away with hardly even mentioning the zombies just a little burden that occasionally wanders through because they have mostly cleared their zone we know they are out there and can be dangerous but that is not what this particular event is about
television,not_removed,i might check out ftwd i dont think i will give twd another chance though most people who still watch that show admit themselves that it just isnt and never was a very good show the general consensus seems to be that there is just too much pointless filler and bad writing with the occasional good episode
television,not_removed,and yet you keep watching nothing wrong with that of course but that is the reason the show is still on the air
television,not_removed,not sure why you included bones in this group arent they on season
television,not_removed,right in the feels
television,not_removed,well thought out
television,not_removed,they are continuations definitely but and are definitely season finale material and and felt so much like season premieres
television,not_removed,when they renewed they announced late or early which isnt much over a year
television,not_removed,true detective is slated to return in i want to meet the toddlers that are running hollywood
television,not_removed,rick going for a shit in the woods being dragged out over three episodes with a flashback to the last time he ate chili this might actually be more interesting than what were currently getting plus the commercials are getting insane i dvr it so i fast forward through them but damn if im not picking up the remote every four or five minutes fuck twd
television,not_removed,it even took place during the night yet this young woman outmaneuvered the puma by awkwardly stumbling around the forest but you need excitement at every hour of because thats the concept the writers were probably like man just slap some puma footage on it or whatever
television,not_removed,man i think the puma was one of unintentionally greatest moments everyone members the puma off the topof their head
television,not_removed,what put me off the most was the incredibly stupid decisions by the characters all the time thankfully we have shows where the writing is just way out of twds league d
television,not_removed,ah i did leave out carol although they did do some serious damage to her character last year
television,not_removed,season was during the writers strike i think but yeah shit just went weird they were no longer in real space but on a desert planet there happened to be like using memory of the same planets in the system that no one could leave cause they were trapped in a pocket of subspace turns out those planets were actually one planet that got split up somehow what the hell is a tesseract just ughhh
television,not_removed,they did this for outlander the first episode trailed weeks behind the us premier for us here in canada it made no sense at all and we were consistantly weeks behind all season and had to dodge spoilers everywhere online wtf
television,not_removed,that works both ways cough planet earth cough cough
television,not_removed,theyre definitely losing ad revenue this way
television,not_removed,yeah and at this point whomever is left isnt worried about the walkers theyre not the real threat just the catalysts for a bunch of psychos to be in control
television,not_removed,i guess it depends on what youre looking for in a show i watch twd and got not for the overall plot but for the characters both shows are really character driven so what some people consider filler episodes because there arent any huge plot advances are actually my favorite because there is a lot of character interaction and character development for example the second half of season four of twd involved very little overall plot they were traveling to terminus but they were my favorite episodes because they were so character heavy
television,not_removed,the writing is hit or miss and all of the barely got away from that zombieshit is getting a little silly but there isnt a ton of filler there is a lot of stuff that is essential to the plot but is very drawn out or overwritten but not a lot of fluff or filler fear the walking dead is a bunch of emo people having trouble with dealing with their emotions while zombies happen to walk around in the background
television,not_removed,yeah but i read the comics so i kind of know the pay off and im kind of pot committed at this point i dont watch any other show regularly so as far as wd goes i guess i have a little bit of the battered wifes syndrome they can abuse me for half a season and ill always take them back when they show me that they love me with some action and violence
television,not_removed,bones has been in basically every time slot imaginable
television,not_removed,yeah but fox pulled some shit with the airing order a little while ago i dont actually watch the show but i remember the uproar
television,not_removed,its more than a year since the premiere many shows have a few months between the end of one season and the beginning of another
television,not_removed,eh id honestly prefer to wait longer for a quality season than get a rushed seasons that doesnt meet the series standards ill be looking forward to rust and marty taking down the administrator of whatever nursing home they end up in in
television,not_removed,this is the first season ive watched week to week i dont understand how people watch these shows almost all of the immersion is lost everytime a commercial pops on
television,not_removed,yes just so bizarre i remember being super excited for the tesseract and the vedra system and what we got was shit
television,not_removed,the severe lack of understanding of globalisation in media companies is staggering
television,not_removed,on the one hand that sucks how far behind are you guys on the other hand at least planet earth isnt something you have to avoid spoilers for
television,not_removed,as someone who finally broke free of the abuse that is twd at the end of last season i can tell you that there is hope there is life outside of twd and it is glorious you can get away from it if you try
television,not_removed,it doesnt start airing in the us until jan ironically episode and leaked online yesterday so pirates get to watch it even before bbc viewers do
television,not_removed,study predicts netflix soon will increase price to
television,not_removed,id get it for a couple of months each year and then cancel it
television,not_removed,this will be my last price hike from netflix if they raise to im out just got amazon prime and will end up costing less for a lot more value day shipping kindle books and a better tv and movie selection with easy access to payperview items as well netflix better step it up if they want to stay viable
television,not_removed,i was paid to be in that study i wasnt about to give it all to netflix
television,not_removed,if they could get a better us selection maybe i spent some time in canada and they seemed to have move a list movies
television,not_removed,i still think they have the best original series daredevil oitnb house of cards kimmy schmidt etc and i like how they pick up shows that have been dropped by the networks so id probably pay just for that but not as much as cable i think the key to justifying a price hike would be getting new episodes fasterthats primarily why i keep my hulu subscription netflix is good for binging hulu is good for keeping up with new episodes and prime is good for hbo not to mention that sweet sweet twoday shipping
television,not_removed,i have a bit of trouble finding stuff i want to watch on it as it stands i wouldnt want to pay either they would need to add more content
television,not_removed,for the offering is a good price
television,not_removed,i certainly wont pay more than for their tiny streaming selection the originals are great but theres really not much other content available that interest me
television,not_removed,im already considering dropping netflix as it is not only is their streaming selection crap i can never get the dvds i want either as far as the content that interests me is concerned amazon and hulu seem to be improving their selections while netflix just continues to charge more for less
television,not_removed,with the selection netflix has i probably wouldnt spend more than bucks to be honest times out of nowadays and i just go to netflix to see if a movieshow is there get disappointed by the results and then leave to find a site that actually has the thing im looking for there im not the type to just sit down and plow through random shows and movies all day
television,not_removed,i think is probably the highest i would be fine with having a running subscription year long if it went to i would probably consider only subbing sometimes
television,not_removed,nooope not unless i can stream netflixs entire video collection movies only on dvd as well when ever where ever i want without the selection changing from country to country
television,not_removed,i wouldnt pay more than for any streaming service i dropped cable and may only get hbo now when got rolls around but between the internet bill netflix and hulu if all streaming channels start increasing to itll be just as expensive as cable so why bother id pay but thats my limit
television,not_removed,what if they split their subscriptions and you have to pay more to get better content like netflix originals
television,not_removed,i think id be okay with paying that much if the content increased significantly specifically if theyd have more tv shows that arent from the past years i mean its great having all these modern shows but id love if it netflixs collection of older shows improved theres only a handful of older sitcoms on netflix and at least one of them is only available as an outoforder collection rather than the entire series with episodes in order for netflix the way it is now is too much money for a significant content increaseimprovement would be more reasonable
television,not_removed,ssssssshhhhhhhhshhhhhhhhhhhhhhshshshhhhhhhshsh wtf you telling everyone for
television,not_removed,tv is pretty good on netflix but movies are weak is past my point especially since i already pay for extra streams thatd push me to about and i just dont think so
television,not_removed,i will solely for their original content who did the study
television,not_removed,i could see myself doing that i do really like some of their original content so subbing for a month or two and binging on that and whatever else they have at the time is something id be willing to do
television,not_removed,they are both extremely good deals when compared to other options though paying bucks a month for a handful of streaming services is still much better than paying for cable my current amazonnetflixhuluhbo combo is about as good as i could ask for
television,not_removed,the costbenefit of subscribing to amazon prime vs netflix just makes me laugh sometimes
television,not_removed,exactly everyone i know is always on netflix but i just realise the last three shows i watched were all on amazon prime vikings mr robot the americans the only shows i watch on netflix recently are the originals and even then ive only seen the marvel ones and stranger things edit downvotes make a lot of sense
television,not_removed,try to be the rest of the world
television,not_removed,the problem is its catch they are already overspending massively on content so there is only so much more content that they can add realistically at the current price point to get more they would need to have more income so they are in a position to put in competitive bids for content when the rights comes up for the service most people seem to want they need much more than a month because their revenues while decent if they were a us only service makes them small fry as a global service but the problem is to get the monthly fee high enough to allow them to compete on the level to be able to provide the global service people want would put a lot of people off because its the high fees of cable that have helped netflix grow in the first place
television,not_removed,what prime video services suck balls want to watch a show in order better fucking find each individual season and queue it up correctly want to watch some laid back mix of animatedturn your brain off shows sorry after x season you have to go find the others enjoy searching on our barely responsive fire tv stick
television,not_removed,if you dont use all the amazon prime stuff other than the video services that doesnt really matter though im sure tons of people just subscribe for the streaming service
television,not_removed,here in méxico we get practically youtube i dropped it this month
television,not_removed,id pay to ensure that i have good content to watch truthfully its still cheaper than cable at that point still perhaps i have no room to complain
television,not_removed,the interface sucks but the content is actually pretty fucking solid
television,not_removed,using a laptop connected to my tv eliminates pretty much all these issuesso
television,not_removed,touché my view though is if im already subscribed i might as well take full advantage
television,not_removed,even is still too low really for them to provide the service people want its the global element thats a real problem for them as in revenue terms they are smaller than the a handful of broadcasters in most resonable sized countries so they are trying to compete with multiple broadcasters in each country who have bigger revenues to fund content from and who only need to focus that budget on one country rather than split it and evidence suggest that while some would pay more than currently many are more price sensitive when they launched in all those countries the most popular articles on here were ones about how to get netflix cheaper by signing up in different counties and the recent price rises have had a negative impact on churn the problem is people arent often looking at is the content value for money but rather is the convince value for money when the content can all be obtained for free
television,not_removed,yeah not everyone enjoys that setup not to mention errors with hdmi and sound not lining up i like a remote when i use a tv not a mouse and keyboard since its much more work and much more awkward to use while trying to sit away on a couch
television,not_removed,is this a freaking quiz i dont believe any of them want a reunion episode do they anniston was in films matthew perry too didnt schwimmer do theatre stuff was in curb your enthusiasm too basically what are you trying to say someone is holding back a grand friends reunion that no one is that bothered about
television,not_removed,its giovanni ribisci isnt it
television,not_removed,lets all just face it david schwimmer is just too big for friends now
television,not_removed,only one of the cast member choose movie industry over tv industry umm all of the primary cast tried to break into movies and only one had success and that was just play rachel green over and over again
television,not_removed,is these english not language first for you
television,not_removed,tom selleck
television,not_removed,tom selleck
television,not_removed,he is too busy getting ready for three men and a brideone day
television,not_removed,cant be he still does tv must be paul rudd
television,not_removed,he is a bloody hillary shill no criticism of clintons irresponsibility and sell outness and corruption
television,not_removed,i was thinking the same thing its almost like he finally relaxed or something and it was fun to watch again
television,not_removed,i disagree what noah has always been lacking has been true satire the kind that requires intelligence noah goes for the cheap immature joke that didnt change during the dnc coverage
television,not_removed,now that the conventions are over i suspect the polygrip will loosen and hell go back to gumming his way through the show
television,not_removed,i still really dont like noah as a host hes not as funny not as edgy not as smart i still feel like hes trying to teach me something instead of making me laugh im watching that show out of habit
television,not_removed,bill maher showed me id like watching him times a week ive always like tds but it is true that he doesnt bring the type of emotion jon pulled when needed that some people might be missing the correspondents now though are very great especially jordan klepper
television,not_removed,nose of color
television,not_removed,most of stewarts criticism of democrats was about how shit they were at winning elections not actual criticism so this is kind of keeping in tradition
television,not_removed,wow i hate this sub sometimes just like two weeks ago the tip post here was him doing a segment on her emails and everyone was like oh man trevor noah is getting better i guess because the hate for clinton is the only thing that outweighs noah hate here that plus nonstop stranger things jerking i think i might stop coming here
television,not_removed,probably because she has a relationship with viacom i dont recall a lot of criticism of hillary from jon either
television,not_removed,shill i seriously dont know if thats a good thing or bad thing
television,not_removed,i felt it was more like he was fed up hes been pretty cheerful the whole time but now the dam burst
television,not_removed,klepper is easily the best one thats why i pointed it out this is the first time that he showed the same type of emotion that jon did
television,not_removed,maybe but it was less needed back then also john didnt do it is not really a reason why he shouldnt
television,not_removed,or ya know theyre both loyal liberal democrats
television,not_removed,he doesnt criticise her at all despite the mountains of things way worse than trump or at least sanders that you could critize her for
television,not_removed,yeah trumps worse than clinton and anyone that uses the word shill wrt to clinton is basically advertising how stupid heshe is and how little information they get from sources that arent reddit
television,not_removed,he has criticized her before but i wont argue it too much tds is clearly leftwinged in their reporting i will argue that trump is way worse than hillary hillary is just another corrupt politician but trump has advocated attacking civilians that are related to terrorists nuclear attacks in europe for some damn reason illegal deportation general torture and a whole more mess of crap id rather take years of nothing happening than years of terrible and dangerous leadership
television,not_removed,i think they have something like that in california
television,not_removed,it has some great moments and acting but like you said something is missing it doesnt feel as weighty as it should overall its watchable but you arent missing much
television,not_removed,acting is good throughout story arcs change pretty substantially by season it just declines in quality overall and gets somewhat unrecognizeable its never a wow me show ever its not that kinda show its a slow burn drama
television,not_removed,it was actually a great show imho until when a certain awesome character left and after that it literally felt like the remaining seasons repeated themselves with the same themes and storylines i only watched a handful of the episodes throughout the seasons after gloria was always a highlight
television,not_removed,i bought the first season two years ago and i really liked it but i heard they got rid of my favorite character after the first season wont say who and decided i was done they also apparently change the formula on it a bit that being said one day i may finish it
television,not_removed,its an alright show mostly that changes quite often if you get a hang of the shows form of storytelling and humor it can be really enjoyable season is a really good season of television the season merritt wever won an emmy it will feel worth it in the end if you stick with it
television,not_removed,it was a really good show that i thought told the story of a functioning drug addiction really well
television,not_removed,i had almost the exact same experience i heard how great it was but i was never able to make it beyond season i seem to recall it being a dark comedy with pretty lackluster comedy
television,not_removed,i love the show personally especially the outstanding merritt weaver but it moves so slowly there are some shows that shake things up on a yearbyyear basis whereas nurse jackie takes years to shift its own paradigm the only weak season is imo because a new show runner took over and the whole feel of the show becomes different but and pick it back up nicely even with the same show runner
television,not_removed,youre not missing out much as said before it can be quite funny but its never one of the greatest
television,not_removed,it doesnt feel as weighty as it should yes precisely well said somewhat hollow or empty i cant tell if its the acting or the writing or both
television,not_removed,thanks i ended up finishing season and then halfway through the second episode of season i couldnt take it anymore oh well
television,not_removed,i hope being on cmt it might become more about the music business then the drama
television,not_removed,im looking forward to seeing more nashville i just hope hayden panettiere is doing okay after her real life struggle with post partum depression earlier this year
television,not_removed,i havent jumped into arrow again after giving it up in season and ive never watched supergirl but i am loving the flash and legends of tomorrow this season i feel like they have both improved legends of tomorrow has especially taken a leap in quality i just wish they would make ray palmer the leader and stop treating that character so poorly
television,not_removed,that was fun didnt understand the lot stuff gave up during but the rest was cool although before i gave up on lot they were ruining timelines left and rightso giving barry shit was a bit ridiculous
television,not_removed,what a great episode there was great action tension and drama it was such a good start to the crossover cant wait for tomorrows episode 😁😁👍
television,not_removed,it was a fun episode but i really hate plots where someone with a time machine complains about not having time for something especially when theyre talking about going back in time to fix something causing problems in the presentfuture if youre going to be mucking with the time line anyway why bother with something that might not even be a problem after you return to the present
television,not_removed,i only watched the pilot of legends and barry asked about cold but what happened to rip hunter wasnt he the team leader of legends
television,not_removed,i think it got a bit tedious with all the time travel blame barry stuff hope they move through it overall fun especially with supergirl and it was great to see speedy
television,not_removed,arrow got better this season too jump directly into season
television,not_removed,season of arrow is where you should jump back in its much improved and more like ive also seen a lot of people saying this season of arrow is the best out of all the dc shows as of now and for supergirl although its cheesy oh so cheesy i still kinda enjoyed it although a lot of people would say otherwise but give it a shot they even introduced superman in though hell only be in a few episodes
television,not_removed,i stopped in season with legends it just didnt hit me did get that better
television,not_removed,lot is more about correcting timeline than ruining them in season reverse flashs us messing with time but lot dont know its him yet an they detect the change and try to correct it
television,not_removed,once lot killed savage and caused the time cops to not exist anymore they became the new self appointed time cops and while being really terrible at the job try hard to fix the timeline when other people break it
television,not_removed,try second season its loads better savage and the hawkpeople are gone
television,not_removed,season of lot is a lot pun intended better season one didnt have a cohesive story and the villain just sucked due to bad writing id really recommend just skipping to season and trying it again
television,not_removed,he went down with his ship so to speak im pretty sure he will be coming back since he just dissapeared im certain he left so he could film broadchurch in england
television,not_removed,should i bother finishing i know generally what happens anyway but i stopped just before the death because it was brutal to sit through
television,not_removed,is a big improvement no savage or hawkpeople and the two nee members gel well with the rest of the team plus the villains are eobard thawne and damien darhk and theyre fun to watch as well
television,not_removed,if i was going to get into have been considering it i may as well pick up where i left off which i believe was was considering supergirl but ive seen the pilot and then last nights episode and i just cant which sucks as i like the character and melissa benoist does a good job
television,not_removed,and bad acting terrible vandal savage
television,not_removed,maybe just read up quickly what happend or just jump in
television,not_removed,i didnt bother just read what happened and jump to dont subject yourself to that pain from the small clips ive seen on rarrow its quite rage inducing
television,not_removed,maybe just watch her death episode then skip the rest of the season instead of watching it ill leave a spoiler to get you caught up to if you want to read it s laurel dies and a girl youll meet steals her costume this girl becomes part of the team in damien darhk hacks all nuke missile silos but felicity is able to contain all except for one which is headed for a big populated city so she hacks into it to direct it to a small town and it kills a few thousand people youll meet a character from there in who becomes a part of the team and then the season finale is probably one of the worst episodes in the season but all you need to know is that oliver kills darhk if you read that now you should be caught up and can start season which is much improved
television,not_removed,ok look melissa benoist carries supergirl almost entirely on her back i cant stand the incessant moralizing and handwringing that is the cws bread and butter nor the absurd and often outright stupid plotlines nor the number of conceits im forced to accept while struggling to suspend disbelief the show is confused and confusing but when its good and thats roughly of the time imo it really has heart and really shows the strengths of the characters involved i mean and tell me you dont get chills of the good kind
television,not_removed,i thought he was a fun villain when they started him in arrow but on lot they watered him down sooo much
television,not_removed,thanks for the summary its much appreciated
television,not_removed,i always enjoy the krytonians getting angry and using their heat vision like in batman v superman when he wants to kill lex to find martha and his eyes glow got similar vibes pun with this scene can you really fight through the other of girlyteenrelationshit stuff to get the good stuff though
television,not_removed,heres how i survive it as i said melissa benoist is a rl superhero for carrying this whole fucking shitshow on her back i love watching her do anything and as the star of the show thats almost the entire that makes it worthwhile john john martian manhunter the actor is serviceable but the characters story is compelling heres an alien who also lost his world and family but doesnt naturally look like his host worlds natives its been interesting watching this character develop and hes very good as a flawed mentor for karasupergirl the fight scenes are often good to very good yes sometimes theyre cheeseballstupidtoo fakey but most of the time i enjoy watching i mean seriously watch that red tornado final fight and tell me its not aclass even though red tornado is stupid in all ways i have bet my time and energy on greb berlantis ability to marry supergirl to the arrowverse right now shes in a different dimension but imo the future of supergirl as a show depends on how closely it can be integrated with the rest of the dc tv shows well see
television,not_removed,heres an alien who also lost his world and family but doesnt naturally look like his host worlds natives but he looks like anyone he wants to
television,not_removed,this is exactly why hes so interesting as a character why does he choose to look like a black man why does he frequently choose to look human when theres no need to hide his true race what is it like for him to know that he has to look human when kara and that other superguy love interest guy i cant remember his name simply fit in with only a pair of glasses its also very clear that his culture is very different than earths cultures and thats got to be challenging as well i find the character in many ways more interesting than supergirls too bad the actor is just good i bet hed do well with better direction and script
television,not_removed,at i could stay out until with out my parents worrying at i was one of the only one who didnt take his bike to school and back and that was in the
television,not_removed,i was on the fence about whether or not i should start this show wasnt really sure what it was about but this short video has at least persuaded me to watch the first episode i guess its done its job
television,not_removed,they clearly changed the tone on the series after the pilot it had retro kitschy and surrealslapstick sequences that didnt get expanded on in latter episodes the series is at least minutes in and the story line hasnt been advanced more than this minute clip im hanging in there but i have friends that stopped watching already
television,not_removed,done what an insisting premise﻿
television,not_removed,mirror
television,not_removed,mirror not available in my country
television,not_removed,might just give it a watch﻿
television,not_removed,i had to be persuaded to watch this show pleased i eventually did its fab
television,not_removed,i am absolutely loving this show it needs to be renewed already amc﻿
television,not_removed,awesome show every episode has been epic so far﻿
television,not_removed,the show is fucking awesome violent wierd i look forward to it every sunday
television,not_removed,
television,not_removed,
television,not_removed,
television,not_removed,im pretty sure they announced a second season yesterday
television,not_removed,i had to do a double take during the intro of the first episode to make sure i was watching the right show
television,not_removed,thanks
television,not_removed,same restrictions as the youtube clip
television,not_removed,this content is currently unavailable
television,not_removed,ye they did its the top post here in rtelevision if im not mistaken
television,not_removed,same here why do they post content to the internet if they dont want people to see it
television,not_removed,i just watched both vids on my phone nothing more i can do
television,not_removed,back in my day the internet was international badumdish
television,not_removed,this isnt south park
television,not_removed,i thought this was an actual sp episode for a few seconds﻿
television,not_removed,that was a really bad answer to a religious counterpoint that isnt that hard to argue against
television,not_removed,not south park
television,not_removed,i assume the question came at the end of a lecture about how religious people are wrong and she was trying to turn it back on him if thats the case then he just batted it back without adding anything just embarrassing her there are probably better ways to answer that question like i guess well just have to wait and see
television,not_removed,this episode was fantastic from start to finish i even enjoyed the scenes with butch man this show is looking to be going in a really good direction huge respect to both the showrunners who listened to the feedback on jeromes untimely death and of course mr cameron monaghan for his beyondstellar performance as jeromethe joker
television,not_removed,you do get that a pile of garbage between us is a metajoke about how theres usually some other show between the simpsons and family guy and has nothing to do with the actual location of the series its not a confession about the location of springfield its a joke about fox sunday night scheduling
television,not_removed,thought groening came out like years ago and said it was oregon or washington or something northwest wherever he grew up
television,not_removed,i agree with everyone that youre overthinking in the wrong direction but at the same time quimby is from mass for sure aaaah
television,not_removed,that ought to answer your question
television,not_removed,there is a scene where lisa is walking through a graveyard and does a double take at a name on a tombstone abraham lincoln we all know what springfield that is case closed
television,not_removed,whatever im fairly certain this shit was settled though
television,not_removed,dude band of brothers

television,not_removed,im not sure if all of these are based on real people but i would consider them historical fiction at least taboo peaky blinders black sails the pacific da vincis demons pillars of the earth the last kingdom

television,not_removed,drunk history
television,not_removed,oh man ive seen that one a long time ago and i dont know how i forgot it haha ill add it
television,not_removed,is medici a drama
television,not_removed,i guess but historically very accurate obviously they dont know the conversations and details of their daily lives so they add the fictional drama surrounding the facts that historians do know of i think they call these type of shows historical fiction
television,not_removed,man i think i am going to love this thanks so much saying this because it looks like the tudors and the borgias
television,not_removed,i use tvtracker on my phone to help as i missed the premiere of lucifer the other week
television,not_removed,wwwthefutoncriticcom maintains a pretty exhaustive db of active and recently canceled shows
television,not_removed,its best that you missed it so you wouldnt have to wait two full weeks for the next episode
television,not_removed,they mustve known about the presidential debate id love to have seen a presidential debate themes episode in which lucifer is in the crowd and getting both candidates to come out with their deepest darkest secrets
television,not_removed,hannibal is pretty resolved imo not a concrete ending which opens up opportunities for potential continuations but its not a cliffhanger in terms of plot hehe
television,not_removed,dead like me got a lame movie to kinda close things out but multiple actors didnt come back for it so its not worth watching still worth watching the series if for mandy patinkins performance alone
television,not_removed,i havent seen terriers but i hear it ends in a pretty good place hannibal has a great ending it leaves things open in case it does get to come back but you can treat the ending as an ending wonderfalls has a good ending very heartwarming deadwoods ending is very anticlimactic and will probably piss you off but i think it kind of does have an ending contrary to most peoples thinking not the ending it deserves but it does have an ending but you should watch deadwood anyway it is fucking fantastic and even with the cancellation one of the best shows ever made and theres a movie in the works so carnivale has an ending but it is not a complete ending these two seasons are basically part of a larger story i would still recommend watching it
television,not_removed,enlightened terriers has so many plot lines but theyre tied up amazingly strip party ends in well exactly the way youd imagine carnivale my so is as im sure youve heard the most lynchian series since twin peaks while it leaves a few unanswered questions its hard to call it unsatisfying
television,not_removed,studio on the sunset strip and party down ended pretty nicely imo
television,not_removed,deadwood ends well in my opinion its not really a capital e ending in terms of wrapping up everything with a little bow and slapping you in the face with this is the final episode but everything pretty much comes to a natural stopping place sure id like there to have been another season but the ending we got doesnt leave you angry just disappointed that there isnt any more same feeling i get with any purposeful finale to be honest rome ends pretty conclusively though how they get there is a bit suspect the latter part of season is fairly rushed so they can reach the ending still an enjoyable show however and the production value is unmatched even today terriers ends with a cliffhanger but all of the main storylines are solidly resolved the ending leaves the door open but in a way that doesnt detract from everything that came before if that makes sense i actually really like it as an ending but i can see how some people wouldnt i would still recommend all three shows if i had to rank them id say deadwood terriers rome
television,not_removed,carnival is unresolvedcliff hanger
television,not_removed,freaks and geeks brought most of the storylines it explored to a conclusive ending
television,not_removed,lights out fx show about a retired boxer making his comeback really liked the show was mad when it was cancelled i think its on netflix i recommend it
television,not_removed,flight of the conchords wasnt cancelled so it does have a conclusive ending
television,not_removed,haha i got it
television,not_removed,hey automoderator think ive said enough already brevity is the soul of wit why dont you approve my post hugs and kisses cannotstopever
television,not_removed,pretty weak coven had some great plot ideas but threw too many in and then just aborted a ton of them leaving a very unfulfilled season with characters who became increasingly unlikable and waste of a season for evan peters and dennis ohare and kathy bates considering all her character actually amounted to in the plot by the end it felt like just a bunch of events happened rather than an actual plot deaths didnt matter jessica langes character became onenote paulsons arc was all over the place etc id hope they actually plot things out better next time
television,not_removed,nice i might actually watch that
television,not_removed,hotel had cameos from both those seasons
television,not_removed,i hated coven i gave up on the show after that season
television,not_removed,whats so frustrating about this show is that its a horror anthology and so the possibilities for content are quite endless still they rely on the same tropes and stories each and every season coven and murder house were my two favorite seasons from ahs but dedicating an entire season where these two stories cross over seems like a complete waste of a season
television,not_removed,this is going to suck so freakin sad
television,not_removed,the worst part of coven is that i enjoyed the premise enough i would have watched six seasons of that show and the movie huge bummer they lost control over it not that i hated the season it just missed for me
television,not_removed,ugh dont remind me of that ridiculously forced queenie appearance
television,not_removed,i loved the stevie nicks tie in though that kind of made the season more watchable
television,not_removed,if you have any inclination to pick it back up this current season is pretty great i wasnt a big fan of anything after coven until this one
television,not_removed,i enjoyed coven but i was aware it wasnt really like seasons and more like a completely different tv show
television,not_removed,have you been watching roanoke cuz were episodes in and its only getting better
television,not_removed,i stopped watching halfway through circus because of this very thing i dont need to see every trope from the theme just pick a couple and do them well and the show will be better for it
television,not_removed,seriously why why bring the character in just to do that to her smh
television,not_removed,personally i loved coven definitely top for me assuming roanoke doesnt shit the bed in the final episodes but thats what i liked about the show how it varied from season to season and you could pop in or out any time some of the light crossovers were okay but some of this shit is getting ridiculous
television,not_removed,yeah ive read that it is pretty good i might watch it when it ends up on netflix
television,not_removed,yeah plus we only have episodes left which really helps tie the whole thing together
television,not_removed,fargo fargo every time
television,not_removed,i would pick fargo season and they actually are connected it takes place in the and while it is about a large cast of characters the one at the center is lou solverson mollys dad in season and the story lou tells malvo in season in the diner is basically what season is heading towards
television,not_removed,fargo season
television,not_removed,black sails it is a great series and this season fourth season started yesterday and is its last one so youll end this series sooner in weeks when last episode airs
television,not_removed,black sails it really is an underrated show
television,not_removed,luke cage
television,not_removed,fargo season followed immediately by black sails throw in the young pope when you finish black sails
television,not_removed,fargo first then sneaky pete really good stuff
television,not_removed,i fell asleep during episode of young pope
television,not_removed,interesting
television,not_removed,a five minute discussion of a complex emotional issue of what true liberty entails it is such a goddamn shame that the alternative side of this argument now is one line if they hate america they should be stripped of their citizenship and be kicked out
television,not_removed,alan alda plays a republican presidential candidate he has a great response at the end of the episode
television,not_removed,the whole episode is great the whole show really ive seen the series four times all the way through and am nearly done with my fifth its still topicalrelevant as ever
television,not_removed,
television,not_removed,not to take away from the importance of this but was that peggy olson playing the presidents daughter
television,not_removed,they still perform this trick from time to time
television,not_removed,bradley whitford should have never grew that mustache for the good guys now he looks stupid without it
television,not_removed,this episode was written by msnbcs lawrence odonnell
television,not_removed,currently on my first watch does it really get bad after season when sorkin leaves
television,not_removed,i never got why whats his face toby gets so mad even if you cant see how the trick worked although it is blatantly obvious at which point the remove the flag you know that it is a trickexcuse mean illusion and they didnt burn the flag if they had actually burned the flag than what the the illusion even be still like the scene though
television,not_removed,thank god the law that hillary proposed didnt pass or they would be in jail
television,not_removed,i know the uploader is just a private person but i still find it ironic that comments are disabled on this particular video
television,not_removed,its not just the alternative side its the fucking next president
television,not_removed,thats not new look what happened when when the republicans have power youre either with them or youre guilty of treason and deserve death the only comfort is that a bunch of people a la dixie chicks will get to say they were right in the next to years after realizing that well need a good years in the supreme court to even start somewhere
television,not_removed,alan alda
television,not_removed,sorkin gave the republican characters way to much integrity and class then in real life this show got so much shit from the right but there were so many great republican characters the blonde lawyer in the first season when john goodman played the speaker of the house and was potus breifly and alan aldas character was fantastic
television,not_removed,shout out for multiple rewatches currently on my and my fiance just doesnt get it
television,not_removed,id no idea it was their actual act and never thought it could possibly be better than the west wing bit but holy hell thats fucking profound
television,not_removed,yep elisabeth moss played zoey bartlet a freshman at georgetown when the show started
television,not_removed,holy crap i have seen all of west wing and good amount of the good guys and i never realized that josh was dan stark
television,not_removed,actually its your statement thats stupid
television,not_removed,theres a very noticeable decline in season the writing team tried to stick to the same formula as the sorkin years and it just didnt work without his dialogue season shakes things up a lot many of the characters get shuffled around and some leave the white house entirely to focus on the campaign to replace bartlet by season the majority of the show is focused on the election storyline and the white house stuff is much less prominent some fans like seasons and and think they were a return to form for the show others dont like them because theyre so different from the sorkin years the only way youll know if youll like them is to watch just dont give up if you find yourself put off by season there may be light on the other side
television,not_removed,not very bad the quality drops noticeably and then declines a little more with every passing season but if you love political shows itd be worth it to watch the west wing for at least for the characters alone
television,not_removed,not really seasons decline a little in quality but still very watchable and imo season is equal to especially the campaign story arc
television,not_removed,it never gets bad but does go from great to merely very good the last season however is awesome
television,not_removed,is the least good it picks up again in and this episode was in season
television,not_removed,he doesnt know or care how the trick works and he personally doesnt care if they burnt a flag hes just got much more important stuff to worry about and knows this is going to monopolise his time for the next few days because a lot of idiots do care
television,not_removed,politically a bunch of idiots will be against it being allowed some people take the flag way to seriously and also arent very rational
television,not_removed,political implications even if he knows it it appears to millions of people that it was burned
television,not_removed,ironic how so
television,not_removed,because nationalist idiots who live in murica
television,not_removed,ainsley hayes she was season and
television,not_removed,but has she seen the walk and talks
television,not_removed,but i distinctly remember it being the burn out drug friend from six feet under that was bf with claire
television,not_removed,im sorry misterdix sometimes i talk about bradley whitford on the internet with no regard for other redditors feelings i like bradley whitford i promise
television,not_removed,i originally watched the episodes when they first aired and thought the last few seasons were crap didnt even see the very ending but having gone through several nutty elections and being in the midst of a completely bizarre presidential primary last summer i finally marathoned through the entire west wing series and ive gotta say that with some perspective over the years the last couple seasons are definitely a change but were still quite outstanding it was like seeing everyone grow up and mature especially josh going from the deputy chief of staff to the presidents righthandman and being the one who convinced your president to run in the first place fuckin eh i wouldnt have hated to see a sequel
television,not_removed,yeah youre right people are idiots and see the headline like obama invites people to the white house that burn the american flag thanks obama never looking at the actual article where it says they didnt actually burn a flag postfact world and whatnot everything is perception and not facts im sad
television,not_removed,gotta love toby hell always be my favorite ww character
television,not_removed,because everyone being able to say what they think even if it is wrong or offensive is a big part of free speech
television,not_removed,oh my bad i was upset they wrote her out she was a great character
television,not_removed,josh come quick sams getting beat up by a girl toby ginger get the popcorn
television,not_removed,did we just go in a circle
television,not_removed,you can really get a workout talking to people around here yea weve heard the jokes
television,not_removed,that sniveling weasel
television,not_removed,as penn jillette pointed out whats the difference in something looking like a flag being burned and a flag actually being burned
television,not_removed,locking youtube comments has nothing to do with free speech
television,not_removed,she briefly came back for season and had her name in the running to be alan aldas characters chief counsel sorkin wrote awesome dialogue for her
television,not_removed,nothing wen all anyone reads is penn jillete burns a flag and they make their opinion on that
television,not_removed,ashes thats the difference there were no ashes you can demonstrably show that nothing was burned
television,not_removed,im sick of seeing this argument free speech does not refer to a legal right if a service or organization prevents you from speaking freely they are taking away your freedom of speech no legal rights have been violated but you still cant speak freely its perfectly fine to call someone or something out when they violate your free speech and the fact that no laws have been broken does not matter of course you know all this because if they were talking about a legal right they would be able to take legal action instead of having a whinge on reddit
television,not_removed,definitely not with the laws of it and it also isnt a big deal but its still funny to me you know the way rthedonald harps about free speech but bans anyone who criticizes trump that example is of course much more blatant and still should be allowed
television,not_removed,are you sure it was the same girl
television,not_removed,freedom of speech is freedom from government censorship not private
television,not_removed,httpwestwingwikiacomwikiainsleyhayes
television,not_removed,you can infer from context that they werent talking about freedom from government censorship its perfectly fine to use it the practical sense if i cannot speak freely i do not have freedom of speech
television,not_removed,the meaning of a phrase is determined by how it is used free speech is commonly and in this case used to refer to a lack of censorship government or otherwise you know they werent talking about freedom from government censorship but you pulled out the first amendment anyway thats what im annoyed about
television,not_removed,wow i guess i didnt realize since she looked a little different that didnt even register to me i thought it was a different character
television,not_removed,the clause is only in regards to government infringement it does not care about how you take it out of context you are wrong
television,not_removed,you can also infer from context that the second amendment refers to an organized militia and not private citizens individually commanding army level weaponry but that doesnt stop people from fighting any and all gun restrictions
television,not_removed,im not talking about the fucking clause jesus christ its like talking to a neutron star
television,not_removed,they literally were talking about the first amendment no they werent they just mentioned a contrast between talking about the explicit right to freedom of speech provided by and then denying free speech not the right on the same very page how would anyone know how its used context they obviously werent talking about the first amendment being violated because thats not how it works you cant require people use words in no ways other than their strict definition because those change a great example would be the word literally for a while there everyone was using it wrong according to the definition so the definition had to catch up and in the meantime people had to infer what people meant from context
television,not_removed,then why are you talking about it you dont have freedom of speech on private websites like reddit and youtube why bring it up you dont have it its like me talking about the million dollars in my bank account why the fuck are you talking about a non existing thing nobody is promising it nobody pretends it exists only when your shit gets deleted for violation of some rule does anyone get angry about it being voided when it doesnt even exist
television,not_removed,im not the guy who started talking about it but i think if enough people criticise censorship the people doing it might feel pressure to stop also some people like to whinge about things not being the way they feel they should or maybe some other reason i dont really care i just jumped on some guy for using a cop out argument cos it annoyed me
television,not_removed,you two are literally arguing over semantics youre using freedom of speech as it refers to the first amendment hes using freedom of speech as it refers to the definition from google now go do something better with your time
television,not_removed,race race race race race race race race race race race race race race race race race race race race race race race race race race race race race race race race race race race race race race race race race race race race race race race race race race race race race race race is there any issue today that isnt being twisted to be framed in a racial context are dems really that worried about black folks wandering away from the plantation
television,not_removed,thank you for bringing this to my attention always looking for some original shows to add to the watch list
television,not_removed,i see love posts about it all the time on this sub
television,not_removed,anything with michael k williams is great
television,not_removed,why is this necessary people have been asking for years for a classic nick tv channel and they responded that they didnt want to open up new channel space so they put the old nick shows on late night fine ok but they apparently do have channel space to open up and they use it for something literally nobody asked for
television,not_removed,because children are the futureof making shitty music we never asked for popular
television,not_removed,does bill burr have sympathy for anyone
television,not_removed,the silence when he just out and out says she blew it is deafening so many people especially those in la where conan is taped just refuse to acknowledge how badly clinton let them down the entire election should have been a lay up obama took us out of a near depression and left office with a growing economy and the whole world basically approving of what he was doing meanwhile the republicans were infighting to destroy each other in the primaries the rnc and medias favorite pick jeb please clap bush fell over quick and left a power vacuum where even people like ben carson was leading at one time on the left side bernie was leading a populist revolution of people showing just how fired up dems could still be even after years of their side in office and yet you know what whatever this is the tv subreddit so ill stop i guess im just glad to see that bill still calls it like he sees it right or wrong and he isnt afraid to go on national tv and criticize clinton something you wont see out of of working comedians
television,not_removed,hes right it was clintons election to lose and she lost it spectacularly people should really point the finger at the entitlement on display from both her and the dnc and their willful misreading ignorance of what voters wanted running an establishment candidate in a campaign when populism was grabbing the headlines was a huge mistake and this was after she had already lost to another populist candidate years before they had all the advantages but supporters still want to point the finger at comey the media who were hardly on trumps side gary johnsonanyone but their own candidate the actual person who couldnt get the votes to pull out the win the sooner yall accept she was the wrong candidate at the wrong time you can avoid making the same mistake yet again
television,not_removed,
television,not_removed,snl actually made a school house rock style skit for executive orders
television,not_removed,nice to finally see a celebrity speak negative towards hillary clinton for once
television,not_removed,yeah people are getting so caught up with being angry about trump they are losing sight of the massive massive failure by hillary and the democrats how incompetent are you to lose an election to donald trump the only reason trump had a chance at winning is how bad she was obama would have wiped the floor with trump and romney would probably have crushed hillary oh you guys have to vote for hillary because all these important issues ok well if these issues are so goddamn important maybe you guys should have run a candidate who wasnt scandalridden and massively unpopular the democrats played chicken with the voters assuming they could win with their shitty pick because the voters would be too scared of the evil republican and then when the voters didnt move out of the way they blame the voters instead of themselves for starting the game and fwiw i didnt vote for trump and actually lean somewhat liberal i vote third party every election because the two party system is fucking terrible
television,not_removed,so true its really amazing that hillary could even lose white women to donald grab em by the pussy trump she and her team were a complete and total clusterfuck hopefully every one of them is working at a home depot somewhere now
television,not_removed,conan slays with that executive order bit very funny
television,not_removed,he haves a point she lost to trump this should been a easy win but she fucked it up royally
television,not_removed,itt losers who got us into this mess desperately trying to justify themselves
television,not_removed,whats the point of reminiscing about clinton trump is president now that conversation is long over focus on the problems we got now the rest is history
television,not_removed,she is literally responsible for trump she rigged the primary against bernie and doomed us all just because she had to have her turn
television,not_removed,lets apply some of bills sports analogy here to properly explain it he didnt explain it fully there is more to it and i know that something truly unfair happened to hillary at the end that shouldnt have happened but overall he is right lets take the new england patriots by all accounts they should have the capability of beating any other football team in this league and we should be able to agree that they should be able to beat a relatively bad football team right right but if the patriots on that particular day completely stink it up sloppy play selfinflected mistakes etc they are still good enough of a team to probably still be up points with a couple of minutes left in the game and lets say that the other team actually pulls off one legitimately effective play to get them just enough points to beat the patriots at the very end or lets say a bad referee call resulted in the other team getting the ball and scoring a touchdown to win them the game the referee call is truly unfortunate and not fair but heres the point the new england patriots had no ungodly business only being points ahead at that point of the game they put themselves in a position in which one unfair event cost them the game that should have never happened same thing applies with the clinton campaign two weeks left in the campaign and she was only points up in the polls before the comey letter hit she had no business having donald trump that close to her none whatsoever she couldnt survive one unforeseen incident and that one unforeseen incident was over inflated because the campaign never addressed it directly and regularly and allowed that issue to be dictated by others they continued to speculate and speculate and with any mysterious tidbit of information they could say oh there must be more details about it in those deleted emails they tried to get rid of alot of small mistakes that put her campaign in the position to be one incident away from losing its not like she didnt put any effort she did put alot of effort in the wrong places and the wrong states she didnt even step foot in wisconsin for the general election will people from her side of the party acknowledge these things candidly you think bill belichick would be telling his players in the lockerroom that they shouldnt be ashamed because it was the refs fault belichick would tear them a new asshole
television,not_removed,he may be right but i feel like you guys should probably let the hilary thing go and worry more about your constitution and government being ripped apart at this moment
television,not_removed,technically clinton lost the electoral votes not the popular seems like people are forgetting that
television,not_removed,ive been trying to say this to progressivesdemocrats since the election if you blame hillarys loss on racist white guys youre missing the point and will continue to lose elections pa went from obama to trump wisconsin went from and michigan went from of the voters werent so racist to vote for trump but not racist to not vote for obama in four years there are other reasons and until the democrats figure it out theyll keep losing unfortunate so far the democrats at least publicly are more interested in blaming racism than finding out the real reasons
television,not_removed,
television,not_removed,good she is a liar a conniver and an entitled cheat who still lost she is a loser in the greatest sense of the word and she has blood on her hands as do her supporters the more people call her out on her bullshit the better
television,not_removed,not particularly related to this video but just watched his special and i think its perhaps be my favourite so far it was different than i expected might play a part in why i liked it so much but i also think hes just a great storyteller at this point loved the gorilla
television,not_removed,burr is my spirit animal
television,not_removed,the greatest comedian alive ladies and gents the truth hurts
television,not_removed,whats the point of reminiscing about clinton trump is president now that conversation is long over focus on the problems we got now the rest is history
television,not_removed,when rtelevision has more reasonable debates than rpolitics
television,not_removed,it was al gore vs bush all over again this time the overconfident idiot was a woman
television,not_removed,in her defense she was way out in front of until the very last moment until that comey announcement days before the election then her lead sank to nothing before this she was right on par almost of having the same chance at winning as obama did in the worst part is the comey announcement turned out to be nothing what really is she supposed to do about that she couldnt do anything but keep telling people that it was nothing considering this election there was an usual amount of people who didnt decide on who they were voting for until the last second so yeah that had a huge impact on the election results
television,not_removed,bills right but on another note holy shit these evening talk shows are painful to watch i remember being on holiday and the only thing i could watch at the hotel was conan or the holidayshopping network i ended up learning about affordable holidays to malta that day
television,not_removed,arnold
television,not_removed,kobe bryant
television,not_removed,he has sympathy for bill burr im kidding he hates that guy more than anyone
television,not_removed,
television,not_removed,that security guard who was caught jackin off at a chargers game i remember him saying that he felt sorry for him take your dick out at a chargers game rub it up and fucking down
television,not_removed,lance armstrong
television,not_removed,he didnt like either candidate going into that election didnt support trump but also saw through the bullshit hillary and dnc were creating
television,not_removed,america
television,not_removed,does anyone have sympathy for hillary
television,not_removed,tiger
television,not_removed,hilary is one of the least deserving in the world
television,not_removed,i love when he calls out the audience taking a silence see how weird it just got in here hahaha he does it very well edit silence
television,not_removed,the silence when he just out and out says she blew it is deafening yea its hilarious and sad how the audience reactsstill in denial i guess ps and the whole world basically approving of what he was doing thats not true at all
television,not_removed,obamas economic policies were very far from good obama is the only president to not have a year of gdp growth and he had years not just on top of that during his presidency the growth in americans personal income is the lowest its ever been with only a increase compared to in the in the and in the on top of that he ballooned the national debt to almost double it from about trillion to about trillion
television,not_removed,hillary did not let me down hillary has been smeared for decades she was blamed for her husbands failure in his first gubernatorial race all because she would not take his last name from that point on she created enemies her role in trying to create universal healthcare in the solidified that i dont blame clinton one bit for that there really is not good strategy to overcome unreasoned hate i actually have a lot of sympathy for her because she has been horrible maligned for years i do not think she has forgotten one iota of that i am kind of at peace she is not president now because people might finally back off
television,not_removed,this is coming from a huge bernie supporter who voted for him in the primary he lost and would have lost no matter what he or the dnc did he also very much might have lost in the general even if more democrats wanted him over hillary
television,not_removed,if bernie was such a slam dunk why did he lose the primaries also worth remembering she won the popular vote by million im not saying she doesnt hold plenty of blame but ffs there was a lot more at play here and the assumption that bernie would have done better is just unfounded
television,not_removed,i guess im just glad to see that bill still calls it like he sees it except if you listen to his podcasts its painfully obvious he has very limited knowledge of politics on either side which isnt his fault hes a comedian its not his job but he mainly judged them on superficial talking points and what he thought of their character
television,not_removed,i find it infuriating how little responsibility people put on hillary for losing the election many of her supporters seems to think it was everyone elses fault but her own of course there were many other factors that influenced the outcome but hillary and her team had her role to play as well
television,not_removed,the silence when he just out and out says she blew it is deafening i mean are they supposed to be start breaking out into laughs and cheering im not sure how you wanted them to react yeah she blew it she fucking sucks still preferable to what we have in office right now and she always will be
television,not_removed,and this was after she had already lost to another populist candidate years before i really need to see this become more generally known the clinton dynasty began starving statelevel democrat campaigns as early as to direct all of those funds toward making hillary president she didnt fully control the dnc in so she got upset by obama she made sure that when rolled around the entire dnc was her yesmen and that no money at all went to state campaigns it all went to her as revealed by the leaks and nobody is talking about the fact that we are where we are because one person wanted to be president one person starved the entire progressive movement for over a decade to try to be president and she still lost this is why the dnc ignored voters wishes they were only answering to hillary
television,not_removed,her slogan was im with her and trumps was make america great again trumps is meaningless drivel but at least it implies consideration of people im with her just sounds like youre supposed to be worshiping clinton for giving you the privilege of having her be your president trump is a lunatic but republicans are going to be republicans ill never forgive clinton and the dnc for unleashing this shitstain of a president upon us
television,not_removed,i saw a comment regarding hillarys loss here on reddit shortly after the election that was so spot on that i felt compelled to save it unfortunately i didnt think to copy the name of the redditor who posted it kudos to the person who penned this looks like russia finally helped the democrats deliver on their promise of transparency what is sad about the dems is that at a time when they should be introspecting theyre looking to shift blame for their own failures ensuring that the dns establishment doesnt actually change this election wasnt actually a referendum on trump it was a referendum on what passes for the modern representatives of the liberal left in america the democratic party theyre blaming the loss on everything from sexism of bernie supporters to russia to fake news to everyone who voted against them being stupid the left finally got an actual populist that talked about actual real issues like trade deals stopping monopolies and putting term limits on congress and what did the dnc do they crushed him to continue the failed policies of the liberal establishment they have abandoned their core principles what passes for liberal today in america has almost nothing to do with classic liberalism individual rights freedom of thoughtspeechetc the great liberal tradition that rejects regressive dogmatic ideologies and which is compassionate to the working class stiffs that build the country is now gone the leftwing movement in this country at least going back the last years or so hasnt really been one of leftwing economics or individualistic free thinking or using government to improve the lives of the working and middle classes whats passed for leftwing politics in this country is really just identity politics promising to give various handouts to some identifiable minority group blacks women illegal immigrants lgbtetc democrats you have completely and utterly lost touch with the common man whose concerns used to be at the very center of the political left today that electrician stringing up wires of homes in wisconsin that welder putting together steel plates in pennsylvania that man whose chapped hands are wielding a big wrench in ohio the many men across the country with dirt under their nails from working with their handsthese arent your people anymore instead you are now the party of the gender studies graduate with manicured nails lecturing others about the evil racist sexist america telling the struggling white working class that they hold white privilege and therefore hold an eternal debt to all nonwhite people based purely on the color of their skin the dnc is the the party of those who go absolutely nuts when a christian baker doesnt want to be forced to bake a cake for a gay wedding yet instantly jumps in to defend insanely backwards ideologies like islam when yet another muslim mass murders innocent homosexuals it is the party of collusion with media to mislead the public of corruption and saying nice empty platitudes that have been filtered through focus groups as to not offend anyone while doing the very opposite of these platitudes it is the party of black lives matter the oppression olympics of different gender pronouns virtue signalling and all the noxious ideas like social justice that claim that all difference in outcome must be due to some etheral discrimination and that places the collectivist forced equality of outcome over the rights of an individual it is the party of the smug air of moral superiority of ivory tower attitudes holding contempt and instantly discounting the views of regular people that dont hold a degree studying critical theory or the works of juddith butler and what has this disconnect lead to the following republicans have won a majority in the house of representatives with seats republicans have won the majority in the senate republicans now hold governorships with a gain of three seats on november republicans control a record of state legislative chambers republicans now hold more total state legislature seats well over of the than they have since a former reality tv star with no government experience whatsoever won the white house president trump will have one supreme court vacancy to fill immediately and could potentially add at least two more justices before his first term is finished the gop now controls all levels of our government it is the most powerful it has been in over years according to real clear politics and washington post come the midterms in the electorate map looks really good for the gop and they could easily win enough seats to pass the threshold needed for them to start changing the constitution completely unopposed you could have prevented this you could have kicked out the out of touch elitists and candidates that cant connect with the average person you could have listened to the common man instead you treated them like utter garbage with the insufferable arrogance of guilt tripping and shaming everyone who disagrees with your identity politics nonsense you made this bed and god damn do you deserve to now sleep in it
television,not_removed,i disagree heavily that the media was largely on trumps side
television,not_removed,the dnc had such a fairy tale in their heads first woman president that they completely ignored that people didnt like her by fairy tale i meant that they wanted back to back milestones first black president then first woman president im fine with a woman president but hilary was clearly not the right candidate
television,not_removed,to be fair she won the popular vote pretty handily the electoral college makes less and less sense for someone not from america
television,not_removed,then she was never going to win then people would never trust her as a populist candidate and if she tried to act antiestablishment people would call her on her bullshit and still not vote for her
television,not_removed,democratic party leaders would by far prefer to keep losing elections than lose their own access to wealth and power the only way they can do that is to continue to prioritize big donors and the security establishment over the american people and totally marginalize any real populist influence in the party expect this up to and including
television,not_removed,still want to point the finger at comey she was ahead in the poll at around vs for trump before the weiner email announcement yeah sure an actual charismatic candidate would have trumped trump anyway since she also had a pretty big unfavorability rating but lets not let comey off the hook either or the republicans throwing anything they could at her for years because they knew she would run and it would make her look bad no matter what the outcome remember benghazi edit heres a bbc article with a nice graphic not that any of you will bother and guess what the final results where
television,not_removed,i can point a finger at both comey the media myself the american public and clinton
television,not_removed,as someone who studies politics there is blame on clinton because he spoke policy in an election where people wanted to hear how things should be to say that trumps strategy of deflection and lying medias constant trump headlines name recognition is huge and comneys announcements did not influence the election is absurd
television,not_removed,forgot to mention the constant fishing expeditions the republicans played against her for years with no apparent end you want to downplay comey by why did you forget to mention his willful violation of the hatch act keep giving them plenty of rope tho itll either be used for their impeachment or to hang those who disagree
television,not_removed,well said trump is a travesty trump likely had russian help comeys timing was questionable etc etc etc all the outrage is justified trump shouldnt be in the wh but trump was also helped by clintons gross campaign ineptitude and hubris she lost wisconsin ffs maybe spend less time campaigning in texas shell forever be a case study in poor campaigning from her primary loss to obama to her primary scare vs sanders to her ge choke her fan base has been trying to scrub this aspect of history as if she has no accountability for her loss or as if she has no history of terrible campaigning and i say bullshiti hold her piss poor campaign accountable as one of the reasons were in this mess yeah she won the popular vote and trump won on the technicality of the ecbut holy shit the system wasnt a mystery she lost to possibly the worst presidential candidate in major party history thats a tough turd to polish folks burrs she blew it is not a very debatable statement however trollish it may sound she indeed blew that part over which she had control i can only laugh at those offended i remember hillbots scoffing at the projections that sanders a populist would perform much better against trump than clinton would its sad you can only lead a horse to water
television,not_removed,the dems didnt have a right candidate or right time for one this tends to happen every years there were only dems who ran and the only worthy competitor was a socialist who couldnt get anyone besides white college kids to vote for him look at primaries dems didnt have the strong intense primary needed
television,not_removed,comey had a measurable impact that brought the race within striking distance for trump and was entirely out of line in his actions im sure the clinton campaign made mistakes but it is far from incorrect to say comey had something to do with it and is an easy example of someone who absolutely should have had nothing to do with it
television,not_removed,agreed hers to lose our years of loss shame on her
television,not_removed,has she ever read the hare and the tortoise thats pretty much what happened to her
television,not_removed,he is right but as bill burr said she wasnt able to garner much excitement if you want to place blame on hillarys loss blame it on her weak campaign lets start from her branding which was ridiculously bland and bad that tells us nothing about her apart from being the first lady of a former us president especially going after obamas strong campaign and being a media darling shes inspired a ton of shows that references her from the good wife veep political animals madam secretary and a variety of characters that promote female politicians and politically ambitious wives this amount of public image preparation with a record amount of donations and a household name is the reason why its a spectacular loss even against all the factors that contributed to trumps win hillary clinton still beat bernie sanders in the primaries by with a share of popular vote over obamas and won over httpsfivethirtyeightcomfeaturesthehiddenimportanceoftheberniesandersvoter if thats what you call willful misreading and ignorance of what voters wanted i dont know what else to tell you i cant believe that even after the election people still feel the need to pile on her and still manage to be blinded by their actions of campaigning against her which did a real dent on her campaign even more
television,not_removed,comeys statement swung a significant number of votes that being said if the dnc backed omalley he would have destroyed trump
television,not_removed,tell that to rblackpeopletwitter theyre still convinced its the racist white dude thing
television,not_removed,people should really point the finger at the entitlement on display from both her and the dnc and their willful misreading ignorance of what voters wanted even as someone from outside the us it felt bizarre how smug she was being i didnt follow much of it at the time until just before the results but she definitely assumed she had it in the bag
television,not_removed,that bit about the womens march hahayou dont walk up to his house lol
television,not_removed,yeah interesting how democrats were saying that the president can use executive orders for anything he wants and obama even said he would just use his power of the pen to go around congress then when another president comes in to power they are reminded why we want checks and balances and didnt want a president to have the power to do anything he wants government should be slow only the things that both sides can agree on should get pushed through this back and forth where things change drastically every election or two is not good
television,not_removed,published on nov they should make a new skit
television,not_removed,its like a not as good httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvpsantrnebgg
television,not_removed,first world problem i know but i had to unfollow so many comedians and actors on twitter the only thing they tweet about now is trump trump trump trump non stop
television,not_removed,i dont really get this though why is getting angry at trump losing sight of hilary trump is president now and hilary is irrelevant to the current climate spending time getting angry at hilary is like turning around in the drivers seat and glaring down a driver who wronged you further back down the motorway instead of keeping your eye on the road ahead he was a dick but hes no longer relevant to whether you might crash in the traffic in front
television,not_removed,agree clinton was a terrible candidate to rig the primaries for at this time distrust in the political establishment is at a year year high so lets rig it for an insincere establishment politician who is best friends wall street has a number of scandals and already blew the last presidential election to a man named barack hussein obama she was simply a terrible candidate democrats dnc and clinton are all to blame for someone like trump winning
television,not_removed,she wasnt unpopular at the start of the campaign it was disgustingly easy to erode support shitty pick she was literally the person who overwhelmingly won the primary could bernie have won instead its possible but so would clinton had comey not dropped an empty letter killing her polling margins by factors of and that is why the fault is ultimately the voters who cares if you arent excited by your candidate who cares about empty scandals vote anyway vote for the best candidate who is a real option otherwise when you end up with trump dont blame anyone else youre the one who let him in and you voted third party i hope you didnt do it anywhere it mattered
television,not_removed,i would say people are losing sight of hilarys and the dncs botched campaign because its increasingly old news how much can really be achieved by continuing to bang that same drum seems more sensible to now focus the attention on whats happening via the current president
television,not_removed,i love how south park interpreted this through one of their recent episodes
television,not_removed,why i need to go to home depot occasionally i dont wanna see them there
television,not_removed,thats more of an indictment of white women than it is hilary
television,not_removed,pretty sure he took it from the snl skit about executive orders im just a bill song
television,not_removed,these people will still be yelling but her emails in years
television,not_removed,seriously do we expect politicians to beg on their knees for our votes or hold our hands its on the onus of the citizen to understand the political consequences gore kerry and now clinton
television,not_removed,bingo this thread is hilarious
television,not_removed,can you explain who the losers are idgi
television,not_removed,because the dnc is seriously considering running clinton again in and not all of us want to see years of trump
television,not_removed,rig is too a strong word was bernie on a level playing field with hillary probably not but she still had million more votes than him
television,not_removed,except where the metaphor fails is that its not ultimately up to the patriots if they win or lose its up to a bunch of people sitting at home
television,not_removed,dude people will still be bashing hillary for years
television,not_removed,worried some of us are reveling in it
television,not_removed,what so far has been done in violation of the constitution
television,not_removed,technically and in reality the popular vote has no meaning at all if it did the campaigns would have been different possibly with the same outcome
television,not_removed,i blame hillarys loss on ignorant people that dont understand domestic politics or geopolitics or the economy or national security their reasons for being ignorant are their own in other words i blame the voters
television,not_removed,i have a lot of middle class friends in wisconsin they werent really protrump but they were overwhelmingly anti hillary
television,not_removed,the strategy seems to be to further alienate white working class people people that traditional vote democrat keep up the protests keep yelling racism keep up the overthetop political correctness its like they dont want to win another election
television,not_removed,ps do not read the youtube comments from this link theyll make your brain ooze out of your ears so theyre typical yt comments
television,not_removed,while i totally agree with your sentiment the guy does social commentary for a living being overtly harsh onedimensional is kind of his shtick
television,not_removed,link
television,not_removed,i dont think gore lost due to overconfidence i think one of the major mistakes his campaign made was distancing gore from bill clinton and lets not forget nader and the ballot issues in florida werent helpful either
television,not_removed,i disagree i think the polls were wrong i think people pretty much had their minds made up before comey pulled that little stunt and there wasnt much that would change people one way or the other
television,not_removed,great man
television,not_removed,dude that guy should be unloading trucks in transylvania
television,not_removed,that whole bit was fantastic and made me realise its crazy how much arnold has achieved over the years
television,not_removed,that skit made me laugh so damn hard when i first saw it when hes pretending to bang the nanny and screaming out weird arnold noises i just lost it
television,not_removed,never hit a layup in her life
television,not_removed,thats the only celebrity death to ever bum me out one of the funniest motherfuckers to ever live
television,not_removed,you pretty much just described america
television,not_removed,i do she wouldve made a great president and she lost partially due to ignorance out of her control her campaign also made key mistakes i dont deny that
television,not_removed,its kind of a shame i tend to disagree with burr on almost everything but his sense of humour and his delivery slay me every time my mind goes to him whenever i see a debate on offence and comedy because i think he could joke about anything even stuff that does bother me and id still find him hilarious because hes a fucking great comedian
television,not_removed,its kinda true obama had huge approval rates across europe
television,not_removed,link to the full interview httpsyoutubeztlonzegonk
television,not_removed,during his presidency the growth in americans personal income is the lowest its ever been with only a increase compared to in the in the and in the wow it almost seems as if theres a trend despite which party is in power nahhhh no way couldnt be
television,not_removed,recession buddy gdp growth is never a guarantee and its certainly not the only measure of economic success and in terms of ballooning the debt if you thought obama was bad just wait until trump starts building the wall
television,not_removed,you might need to do some fact checking bill clinton won the first time he ran for governor
television,not_removed,if this thread is any indication people are never gonna back off of blaming her for every bad thing trump does
television,not_removed,of course she was smeared her whole career in fact but the fact still remains she shouldve had the upper hand going in and her the dnc blew it by deviating from the typical campaigning strategy realize that even tho shes been smeared so has trump
television,not_removed,i think you have to remember where bernie was when he announced his presidency he had practically no chance of winning but over the course of a year and a half he took the political world by storm and very nearly won the primary against the candidate who was pretty much guaranteed to win bernie would have only continued to gain popularity and without the irrational hate that many republicans had against hillary and the lack of a big scandal for trump to focus on trump wouldve been dismantled in the first debate
television,not_removed,gee its as if you have to spend to get out of the worst recession since the great depression that and he actually added the iraq war costs to the books which bush kept off
television,not_removed,i take it you didnt watch the news trump bombed yemen
television,not_removed,trump has already say over war crimes hows that feel hell he advocated for war crimes
television,not_removed,thats ridiculous
television,not_removed,youre a scary voter
television,not_removed,then youre a stupid voter
television,not_removed,she made sure that when rolled around the entire dnc was her yesmen and that no money at all went to state campaigns httpmichaelmoorecomtrumpwillwin of all freakin people warned democrats that they were going to lose the rust belt to trump dems had been ignoring the requests of statelevel campaigners for months and put no effort into running a campaign there except for pennsylvania but they clearly failed to inspire they really thought because of obamas success they just didnt need to bother apparently
television,not_removed,and now we are a few states away from the republicans controlling enough state legislatures and governors to be able to pass constitutional amendments with no input or support from the opposition thanks clintons regardless of where you feel you stand politically it should scare you when one party has the power to pass amendments or whats already happening one party controls the federal legislature and presidency while that president is a reactionary strongman who has everyone on his team scared to death of losing their entire political career as a result of a single tweet
television,not_removed,wow ive only skimmed the wikileaks stuff didnt realize she gobbled up all the state money
television,not_removed,i hope the hardcore dems on reddit are reading your and unumbernulls comments they can argue all day about what hillarys opponents did that was unfair to fuck her over however in the end she lost by a margin that could have been remedied by you know not colluding with superdelegates and the dnc or stealing statelevel funds by campaigning for a larger supporter basethe entire maybe instead of playing favorites with hardcore dems sure racists and bigots are terrible people comey might have had enough of an effect on the swing states to swing the electoral college the representative system in the electoral college house and senate are geared against cities which are heavily democratic this is all true but none of this would have mattered if democrats had picked a nominee that didnt play directly into trumps hands scandals lies and cronyism
television,not_removed,sources
television,not_removed,this is why the dnc ignored voters wishes oh for fucks sakes she won by like million votes unless you think they where all illegals the dnc playing favourites didnt get her all those votes it was the clinton brand name amongst black people while bernie was an old white guy in the end the issue was that both her and mr orange both had shit favourable ratings so the one with the latest bad optics before the election lost kellyanne getting trump to stop tweeting was her greatest contribution imo
television,not_removed,im with her wasnt her campaign slogan the official slogan was stronger together the first one was popularized by her supporters
television,not_removed,except literally all his messaging was how he alone would fix it and her actual slogan and what she said nearly every speech was how america is stronger together and how it will take the effort of everyone to benefit everyone
television,not_removed,conservatism is dying as well look at the gops willingness to legislate private matters or personal choices gay marriage or the fact that three of the last four gop potus have grownwill grow our deficits neither party is sticking to their ideals
television,not_removed,the dnc is the the party of those who go absolutely nuts when a christian baker doesnt want to be forced to bake a cake for a gay wedding yet instantly jumps in to defend insanely backwards ideologies like islam when yet another muslim mass murders innocent homosexuals reason being many of the muslims in the us are quite westernized and dont hold the same viewpoints
television,not_removed,
television,not_removed,do you know what is truly interesting i read through these comments and found that the source of the quote you provide as i was there reading it i couldnt help but notice an enormous difference in the tone and thoughtfulness as well as the vote and gilding characteristics i went back and looked at some other posts just from a couple of months ago and wow is the difference between reddit then and reddit now stark seems to reflect an artificial and intentional influence on reddit discourse when are the offending individualsgroups responsible going to realize that it doesnt result in the desired effect
television,not_removed,of course trump didnt make any of those problems better except maybe trade deals and we dont even know that yet now the republicans are in power who are consistently worse for the average worker the would make unions illegal if they could deregulation of everything which reduces consumer safety etc plus the swamp was definitely not drained
television,not_removed,oooh look another its everyones fault but trump voters and probably libertarians that trump is president post
television,not_removed,looks like russia finally helped the democrats deliver on their promise of transparency i understand the snark in this but dont let partisanship get in the way of a foreign government selectively releasing information for the purpose of interfering with the election it cant get more serious than that in the modern world of interfering with elections and if you retort that the us did the same that does not absolve russia of any blame or retaliation nor does it mean we cannot defend ourselves and this is far from the first place to start finding american hypocrisy what is sad about the dems is that at a time when they should be democrats you have completely and utterly lost touch with the common man whose concerns used to be at the very center of the political left a whole bunch of chestpuffing rhetoric with lots of lazy stereotypes that has one underlying point which the writer has finally come to yes the democrats have shifted away ever so slightly from the working class roots in messaging only not in policy to fail to make that distinction is to fail to realize how thoroughly the republicans have decimated workers rights since the reagan era instead you are now the party of the gender studies graduate with manicured nails lecturing others about the evil racist sexist america telling the struggling white working class that they hold white privilege and therefore hold an eternal debt to all nonwhite people based purely on the color of their skin cherry picking the worst examples to support his points which lends me to believe that the writer doesnt have something solid behind that diatribe the dnc is the the party of those who go absolutely nuts when a christian baker doesnt want to be forced to bake a cake for a gay wedding yet instantly jumps in to defend insanely backwards ideologies like islam when yet another muslim mass murders innocent homosexuals false and quite hypocritical considering who the vpelect is and his view of homosexuality to lump fighting for equal rights in this country irrespective of religion or orientation with the laziest and most intellectually dishonest way of painting nearly billion adherents of a faith is just beyond words for me it is the party of collusion with media it is the party of black lives matter it is the party of the smug air of moral superiority in all these words the writer fails to make a coherent point whatsoever nor does the writer convince a neutral reader that painting an accurate picture of the democrats by cherry picking tired tropes shunted out by the right i am frankly surprised that the war on christmas didnt make it there and god damn do you deserve to now sleep in it and this is where i presume the author or reader climaxes congrats for sharing some td talking points
television,not_removed,oh wow a tirade on social justice issues as if there was nothing else different between the two that anyone cared about like the environment or education or science or global trade or geopolitics as if acknowledging inequality is even such a bad thing to begin with just because it annoys the majority to realize such things exist no the only thing hilary did wrong is not holding her public opinion far enough from her private ones this country is full of racists its full of of idiots they deserve to be pandered to deceived and fucked over thats the lesson the democrats should take away win win then do whatever the hell you want the they play their cards right though they can pander to them deceive them and not fuck them over hell they can even help them as most of their policies were at least trying to do because they actually have experts vetting them instead of white nationalist shitheads
television,not_removed,and this forced people to vote for a fucking fascist no just goddamned no
television,not_removed,whats passed for leftwing politics in this country is really just identity politics promising to give various handouts to some identifiable minority group blacks women illegal immigrants lgbtetc fuck me that resonates that really resonates
television,not_removed,read that again its poorly worded but he was saying that the media were not on trumps side
television,not_removed,i dont know that you can say they took his side but they are certainly a large role in why he got elected they gave him soooooooo much airtime early on and though the primary and largely it was uncritically analyzed despite that he would often do things that individually would sink a campaign i think as time got on it was getting ridiculous not to focus more critically on the things he says and his history but it turns out that the media still fell into a trap that ultimately benefited donald the most if the election was about the issues hillary would have won donald obviously very weak policy the media focused more on hillarys emails than all policy combined
television,not_removed,the whole notion that the electorate especially bernie supporters were somehow largely against having a woman for president was pretty insulting
television,not_removed,but obama won twice if she was like obama then she would have won what about the people who voted for obama but sat this election out or flipped why did most minority voters vote for trump more than they did romney even when he said shit like having to get rid of the bad hombres hell he won white women despite the grab them by the pussy line i guess thats less offensive than mitts binders full of women
television,not_removed,she did lose it there were lots of people who would never vote for trump in a million years but who just sort of assumed hillary was going to win but she was so inherently distasteful as a candidate these people voted third party or wrote in mickey mouse or just didnt bother to vote because damn if they were going to give her any political support people were motivated to vote for trump people were motivated to vote against trump almost nobody really wanted to vote for hillary she was an unpalatable alternative nothing more
television,not_removed,what obama won twice handily please this is just dumb
television,not_removed,its basically so smaller states dont get completely overwhelmed by the wishes of the more populous states at least from my limited understanding but it does end up discouraging a ton of people to vote when your state is dominantly one party
television,not_removed,that and about four bucks will get you a cup of coffee
television,not_removed,all you need to know is that with california out of the mix trump won the popular vote by a couple million that is why the electoral college is in place so ca ny and a few metro areas dont swamp the votes of most of the rest of the country also you cant change the rules after the contest had it been a popular vote election both campaigns would have been drastically different so there is no point at all in speculating after the fact trump may well have won that as well if those were the rules going in
television,not_removed,exactly what is that guy even saying she should fake her way to the presidency she is the status quo you go with her for more of the same which is pretty good trump just fired up more voters who never cared about politics until they saw someone who wasnt a politician running classic underdog story
television,not_removed,see cory bookers vote against bernies amendment for importing drugs from canada for a pretty clear affirmation of your point
television,not_removed,she was ahead in the poll at around vs for trump before the weiner email announcement maybe the polls were wrong
television,not_removed,to say one thing influenced an election in general is insane there were many factors on both sides and theres years worth of study to be done on the election
television,not_removed,as someone who studies politics yes dear we all read the news
television,not_removed,as someone who studies politics yes dear we all read the news
television,not_removed,i think most people just are annoyed by her teams refusal to accept blame at all though the point is that it should never have been that close interview after interview they look for and talk about scapegoats id like to see them say we screwed up
television,not_removed,the hair won
television,not_removed,except the hare got two million more votes
television,not_removed,its hard to look at the primary as a reliable indicator given what we know about the conduct of the dnc and media over the course of it quite frankly with the cleared out field she faced from the perspective of say august its extremely unimpressive that she almost managed to lose to a geriatric socialist with little to no name recognition
television,not_removed,orders can be on different scales you know if one is unconstitutional justice systems should step in it did under the relevant obama one immigration trump fired the justice system person who stepped in for his
television,not_removed,gave up on colbert and all those for this reason theres other shit going on too
television,not_removed,holy shit youre not kidding the comedy community is suffering from a massive epidemic of trump derangement syndrome judd apatow and patton oswalt need to be quarantined
television,not_removed,max landis twitter was always entertaining for how his outspoken stance on movies pissed a lot of people off his criticism of force awakens for example but now getting to that good shit involves skipping over this political posts
television,not_removed,hilary is irrelevant to the current climate those who fail to learn history are doomed to repeat it
television,not_removed,because most of them are just sitting around bitching at the voters when they should be focusing on how to win future elections they need to look at clintons failure as part of reforming the democratic party and even if they think more people should have reluctantly voted for hillary as a perceived lesser evil if nothing else they still need to reflect on why so many people were so reluctant to vote for hillary because if they couldnt even beat trump how are they planning to beat future people or congressional govenatorial races against people who will mostly be stronger than trump even if they want to blame the voters you have to win elections with the voters you have not the voters you want and while there will be some demographic changes the next election will be mostly the same electorate
television,not_removed,she wasnt as unpopular but she was unpopular if comey really was out to get her he could have recommended indictment even if it hypothetically wouldnt stick she would be done besides here is an important truth about scandals allegations of scandals gaffes etc they are the most damaging when they confirm or reinforce something the people already thought or suspected thats why rubios rubot meltdown was so bad for him people already thought of him as an empty suit who just gave good sound bites likewise the reason the comey letter was so damning was because so many people even neutral people already thought of her as corrupt as dishonest she also won the primary largely on the strength of states the democrats were never going to win in the general anyways and part of running a political campaign is to try and avoid having your support eroded so even by your terms she still failed hard as for the third party shit dont try and pin this on me donald trump is one man yet the two party system that people like you continue to allow to exist fucks up our entire political system including making it possible for trump to win
television,not_removed,she overwhelmingly won a rigged primary with the help of party insider superdelegates who declared insanely early what youre saying is roughly analogous to saying trump crushed clinton using as your basis the electoral vote count it may be technically correct which as we all know is the best kind of correct but its hardly useful for analysis as far as voting third party with all due respect that attitude is a big part of what keeps us trapped in the situation that made the last election possible
television,not_removed,and you voted third party i hope you didnt do it anywhere it mattered so everywhere dont push down the party vote
television,not_removed,because understanding her failure is important to winning the next election
television,not_removed,there were definitely times during the campaign when i said oh my god she is such a turd sandwich when she consistently found ways to avoid winning
television,not_removed,thats as obscure of a reference as ive seen lately hahaha was it because of the haircut
television,not_removed,i remember hearing her voice on npr and instinctively turned down the volume i voted for the woman but she was just offputting imo
television,not_removed,for all her flaws and mistakes which are undeniable i refuse to blame hilary for the actions of millions of grown adults who looked at both of them and decided trump was the better choice
television,not_removed,edgelords whod rather plunge the world into chaos than vote for a fucking bitch
television,not_removed,those who are blaming clinton for trump winning
television,not_removed,unlikely this rarely happens shed be well into her not even on peoples radar now
television,not_removed,nonneocon sources
television,not_removed,the dnc directly colluded with both hillarys team and the msm to suppress bernies message and his supporters rather than hold a fair primary they were ready to coronate hillary from day as evidenced by her superdelegates other shady examples like this and this check out rdncleaks as well
television,not_removed,is it illegally funneling money to her campaign instructing the media on how to attack him greatly limiting the number of debates and putting them up against popular sporting events and thats ignoring the areas where outright fraud seems to have occurred like the supposed mistake in reporting in colorado or the fact that something like of her caucus votes in wyoming i think were absentee or bill electioneering in massachusetts i dont think rigged is too strong of a word at all
television,not_removed,eh you are thinking in the later stages of the process the republicans had whatlike people running at the start whereas the democrats didnt even try because she had such influence in the party the only other person to run was an independent turned democratbernieshe fucked things up from the start it would have been nice to have at least democrats running from the beginning
television,not_removed,as a direct result of what the msm and dnc did to rig the primary not sure where you cant connect those dots
television,not_removed,million weird it is just like trump saying their were million illegal votes in the final election
television,not_removed,a simple vote from the individual states dnc election committees would have allowed independents to vote for bernie this was denied everywhere hillary would have drowned under bernies independent voters but they were locked out of voting for him
television,not_removed,the dnc actively sabotaged the sanders campaign
television,not_removed,you basically saying that the democratic partyhillary campaign doesnt have any responsibility to win elections that they participate in what that means is that a person is no longer looking for answers for the purposes of selfimprovement that is fatalistic thinking right there
television,not_removed,his recent immigration ban is probably unconstitutional but we will have to wait for scotus to decide many constitutional scholars believe it is
television,not_removed,yeah but the arguments im seeing here is that the dnc failed the people when in fact she was more popular than trump
television,not_removed,well you have four years to educate everyone chances are things wont change much the american people hate two things in their leaders inaction and hypocrisy trump for all his faults is neither of these things if he sticks to his promises the same people who elected him will reelect him the power of incumbency is pretty vast
television,not_removed,white working class havent voted left in over years check the south for proof
television,not_removed,in this age of tiptoeing around everyones feelings truth comes across as harsh his commentary is deadon she fucking blew it
television,not_removed,i sort of get the nader blame but more democrats voted for bush in florida than voted for nader
television,not_removed,why on earth dont you americans have preferential voting it seems like itd solve so many issues
television,not_removed,the polls werent wrong they were within the margin of error
television,not_removed,one of the greatest men alive
television,not_removed,one of my favorite lines ever
television,not_removed,i literally hear his voice every day because i dont want to not hear it rip mrp may you be whispering calmo to brazilian angels in heaven
television,not_removed,i know too many people who just ate up every bit of the dncs tripe and came out of the election sore calling everybody who didnt vote for hillary sexist and racist some were even acquaintances who i couldnt help but feel disappointed at their gullibility
television,not_removed,reddit still cant see though hillarys bullshit
television,not_removed,bill burr for president
television,not_removed,absolutely i dont agree with everything he says but he does get people to empathize the other side i think thats what everyone needs im thinking more like how he did that bit against an epidemic of gold digging whores check out this clip from his podcast after he did that conan spot
television,not_removed,problem is that doesnt matter in the usa he was around at best approval at the end
television,not_removed,which makes sense since obama is a globalist and so are most european countries hell the dude was campaigning on behalf of the remain group for brexit he does worldwide tours apologizing for america not surprising hes popular over there plus no european has to live under his governance
television,not_removed,yes because a wall that is estimated to cost billion dollars is an astronomical increase to trillion dollars
television,not_removed,were not blaming her for trumps actions were blaming her for her own willful ignorance and the actions she took to throw a wrench into bernies campaign she is the reason he lost not because of the people but because her and the dnc sabotaged his campaign they reaped their own shit fields now they can sow it too
television,not_removed,no doubt there were definite mistakes they should have invested more resources in the rust belt it was not enough to have the right platform the problem is hillary is a policy wonk so while trump will stand there and lie to your face hillary is highly hesitant to promise the world i do not think she felt that would be wise
television,not_removed,yep i live in pennsylvania and went to see her when she came i dont remember feeling particularly inspired because she basically only bashed trump and asked people to volunteer for her she said almost nothing that mattered to the people of my area so i am not surprised that pa went red
television,not_removed,and obama being a success was not as universally thought as they believed it to be
television,not_removed,when was that posted
television,not_removed,wow thats the first time ive seen that article i know hes not the only person to have called it by a long shot but its interesting how certain he sounds at that point
television,not_removed,hell there are reports bill was telling her to get off her ass and campaign to rust belt men she was too stupid to listen to one of the best politicians of the generation she happened to be married to
television,not_removed,well said by the way is this the real boots electric because im a huge fan
television,not_removed,he also had a focus of change which can win nonestablishment votes the reality for sometime now is that very few people are actually happy with american politics as a whole so a politician that represents the establishment is starting the race behind the eight ball even before trump won with no political experience obama and bush were relatively young guys without a ton of time spent in washington to make them establishment guys even with bush being a bush he as a governor of just years was less of a washington insider than mccain or kerry who had both been in congress for at least a decade and a half
television,not_removed,the dnc did whatever they could to limit bernie sanders exposure including funneling all money to hillary instructing the media on how to turn the narrative against him and drastically reducing the number of debates and scheduling them opposite major sporting events million votes is a lot but the dnc and the media carefully constructed a narrative that hillary had already won from the get go instead of allowing the candidates to gain exposure and present their case we will never know if bernie would have won a fair fight but you have to see that the dnc worked hand in hand with the media and hillarys campaign to do everything they could to undermine his campaign thats the exact opposite of how the primaries should work
television,not_removed,oh for fucks sakes she won by like million votes yeah she won california by million votes ec system is in place to prevent one state from controlling all the elections its how it was designed
television,not_removed,trump won with less votes than romney lost to obama with in she just sucked
television,not_removed,its all from california if you deduct californias popular vote from both clinton and trump trump wins by votes for reference if you did the same deduction to obama and romney in obama still wins by over
television,not_removed,the only reason she got more votes was because of a concentrated effort from the dnc and msm working together to do a media blackout on bernie and fuel a narrative that he had no chance to turn down his supporters not to mention the missing voter rolls of newly registered bernie supporters who were never able to vote for him
television,not_removed,lack of charisma is pretty much a death sentence for a candidate youd think they would have learned that already with gore
television,not_removed,this so much this hilary has cultivated a base of disdain from middle america since she was the first lady she could have easily overcome this if she had an ounce of charm or charisma she was basically a stuffy robotic pantsuit and since we know most voters arent voting strictly on issues they need to be excited by a candidate
television,not_removed,sanders lost a lot of moderates with his whole white people dont know what its like to be poor thing
television,not_removed,but she actually cared and put forward an agenda far more catered to class issues that is the thing that bothers me about the postelection rhetoric perhaps lack of charisma plays into that it did not come across because she was not blustery or using simple words that lacked meaning but sounded good
television,not_removed,as a conservative i agree and the spending of the money jeebus basically democrat lite and a true conservative should not care what two people do as i voted for bush in i voted against the stupid defense of marriage act and a few conservatives who voted for bush voted against it as well and it beat bush by points here in georgia the government should not codify who should marry whom as long as they are both functional adults i am for gay marriage legal pot and a lowering spending
television,not_removed,islam is no more backwards than christianity the only difference is most largely muslim countries have a hell of a lot more turmoil than largely christian countries largely as a result of us foreign policy
television,not_removed,in messaging only not in policy yeah and i suppose clintons overwhelming support of tpp was all done in the name of joe workingman shakes head
television,not_removed,in messaging only not in policy not really they are better than the republicans but the last two democratic presidents have been pretty solidly supportive of wall street instead of working class america they are better than the republicans but part of the reason the republicans have moved so far right is because there was no real defense of alternative policies from the democrats
television,not_removed,i really hope this thread is just thedonald brigading its too dumb to be real
television,not_removed,yeah because the democrats dont gerrymander either ffs not that i support it on either side i have no clue why state legislatures get to draw the boundaries have an independent commission redraw the boundaries every years or so to account for population changes and try to give them some sense of geographic consistency
television,not_removed,it more likely forced people to not vote at all
television,not_removed,i wouldnt say they were on his side but they definitely gave him a lot of coverage in the primaries that helped him stand out from the rest of the pack
television,not_removed,youre banned from rpolitics no but seriously saying that someone should get checked by a professional if they think trump will literally become hitler the next emperor palpatine and duerte combined will get you banned and apparently civil war is upon us and its magnificent to see the uprising start right now those are real comments wih votes on every second top thread
television,not_removed,a lot has changed in years obama actually presented himself as a moderate candidate bill maher seems to get it at the end of his last show social justice identity politics and overthetop political correctness is killing the party the democrats need to take a new direction if they plan on winning another election
television,not_removed,because obama knew how to run a winning campaign
television,not_removed,one of many
television,not_removed,except that she got the that she was polling at while trump got more then he polled at which is well within the margin of error people just dont actually seem to understand how polls work which is why way too many quote the betting odds some outlets where using as if those where the polls
television,not_removed,oh ya i agree
television,not_removed,ugh colbert is unwatchable these days
television,not_removed,im starting to wonder about colbert i trusted him to see both sides and bring perspective i was wrong
television,not_removed,trump is terrible and most people dont like him what do you expect
television,not_removed,i should have been more clear shes irrelevant in that she currently holds nowhere near the political power of trump so to act as if we should be keeping one eye on her is ridiculous trump is president hilary clinton is just hilary clinton if you reject someone for a job do you neglect the actual employee to stalk your rejected candidate
television,not_removed,the primaries werent fucking rigged for hillary til entire dnc deciding that they would sandbang sanders isnt rigging the primaries even though multiple people were forced to resign after it was exposed
television,not_removed,even if this is true she should have never appointed dws to any position associated with her campaign after her resignation i gave a very strong signal to a large swath of poor white voters that clinton did not give a fuck what they thought
television,not_removed,bernie bros still believe he wouldve destroyed trump in the general its insanity but youll never win the argument ive tried many many times
television,not_removed,i would agree with the rigged bs if bernie had actually campaigned in texas alabama etc he lost almost every state on super tuesday because he didnt really try in the south the same thing hillary did with the rust belt in the general he lost those with massive margins his early campaign just sucked period his late campaign was much better but he picked up momentum too late he needed to get more around iowa and nh but it ended up happening after florida the onlying rigging was like a debate question and just everyone assuming she was going to win which was likely anyway none of that was enough to change the minds of millioons of people im sorry
television,not_removed,theres understanding then theres beating a dead horse the failings of the dnc and clinton are well documented at this point what is there left that isnt understood
television,not_removed,oh those i didnt vote because clowns
television,not_removed,its his anus
television,not_removed,wheres the proof
television,not_removed,dont use the word illegal when it was legal
television,not_removed,you need to stop believing everything you read on the internet
television,not_removed,wheres the proof
television,not_removed,i forgot why i ignored anything having to do with bill burr thanks for reminding me
television,not_removed,then why blame hillary for losing the general it was rigged against her by your standards
television,not_removed,technically there were exactly
television,not_removed,rig implies they manipulated the results which definitely didnt happen im not saying the dnc didnt favor clinton but i dont think they did to an extent that made her victory illegitimate
television,not_removed,you basically saying that the democratic partyhillary campaign doesnt have any responsibility to win elections that they participate in i am saying that it is ultimately not up to the party or the candidate whether or not they win it rests with the voters
television,not_removed,its not if you think it is you either havent read it dont understand how laws work in the united states or have been paying too much attention to fake news the president is well within his rights to at any time restrict access to the united states to any person or country in the name of national security his executive memorandum does not persecute any group for religious racial or any other discriminatory reasons and is entirely based on the previous administrations recommendations based on those particular countries history of exporting terrorism as well as not providing the us with sufficient vetting or screening of their own the president specifically chose countries already deemed by the previous administration as too dangerous the majority of americans support this decision as evidenced by the new rasmussen polls coming out on the subject and were part of his campaign whether his opposition ever believed his campaign promises or not is solely on them but this is not surprising unconstitutional or unexpected in any way shape or form
television,not_removed,more popular in california where she won by million votes and republicans stay home remove that state and trump apparently won the popular vote by a million or more still the popular vote is irrelevant because it isnt and has never been the deciding factor
television,not_removed,im not going to speculate about
television,not_removed,its not when the not a politician hype was so real
television,not_removed,thats pretty disappointing that this comment has the little controversial cross its the truth plain a simple hell i voted for hillary and completely understand this is what happened for the most part i have some friends most of which i know are not racist who voted for trump that attitude of drain the swamp make america great again lock em up etc is what made millions of mildyetmyopic voters so attracted to him people are going to have to learn to sift the bullshit from the bullshit and make an educated vote even if theyre not comfortable with it i didnt want to vote for hillary but i knew whats going on now is exactly what was going to happen
television,not_removed,except they voted for obama and years ago
television,not_removed,truth in this case is subjective i personally think hes oversimplifying a lot of his commentary to appeal to people who want to be told what to think or want their opinions reinforced just because hes blunt and straightforward doesnt mean hes right he himself is really chalking it up to a single factor which is what someone does when theyre trying to appeal to stupid people
television,not_removed,naw i totally agree i just meant that with respectful regards to utnickels post i dont understand why you cant get that through your head blaming trumps win on just one particular factor or in this case one particular person proves that bill has his head up his ass that he doesnt have his head up his ass i think he fully understands how many factors led to the outcome but his niche is taking a hard stance against things
television,not_removed,you think the democrats who voted for the green party would have been the ones to vote for bush over gore you know where the green party is on the political spectrum right
television,not_removed,correct polling was close enough that clinton supporters could easily dismiss trouble spots and tight races as statistical error without bothering themselves to entertain the notion that the ground was moving under their feet five thirty eight is doing a good job of assessing the election and doing an autopsy on the poll numbers theyre not at all happy about trump but neither do they say we didnt see this coming they say we saw something like this as very possible and nobody paid any attention because they just didnt make room for it in their reality
television,not_removed,wouldnt you rather have clinton now though
television,not_removed,my goto in that case is to ask if they voted if yes i asked them where blustering and stammering a lot of the time i cant believe how many of these self righteous douches didnt even bother to vote foragainst a person that now i have to fuckin hear about god damn ridiculous how the hell do people not understand that tweeting and bitching when you drink isnt a political action
television,not_removed,they do they are just aware of the fact that trump is times worse
television,not_removed,i think most people can theyre just starting to see trumps bullshit now that the spotlight is just on him
television,not_removed,you clearly forgot the whole bernie phase
television,not_removed,your post has been removed by the rpolitics autobot for being mysteriously down voted into oblivion
television,not_removed,well hes popular here as well so most enjoyed living under his governance here as well
television,not_removed,if it did anything useful id agree but its a billion dollar saber rattle which is asinine
television,not_removed,yeah the wall is just another expense however the guy promised not to destroy peoples social security and medicare so if he is not touching entitlements significantly increasing the size of the military and lowering taxes reducing revenue that yearly deficit that has been shrinking every year is going to increase rapidly and that debt that is bothering you is going to go even further out of control at a much faster rate
television,not_removed,willful ignorance what was she supposed to do decide in march that well i have more delegates but this cnn poll says sanders would do better against trump so im going to drop out youre right shes the reason he lost because more people voted for her than bernie
television,not_removed,hillary is highly hesitant to promise the world wipe it like with cloth hillary clinton
television,not_removed,i have no idea what college you went to but that wasnt my college experience at all whos afraid of debate
television,not_removed,lol no perhaps you clearly not understanding bernies policy whatsofuckingever is why you went from him to fucking trump who is the antibernie thats why youre a scary voter
television,not_removed,also in pa although i didnt go to see her her whole platform was not trump and sorta bernie suuuuper inspiring
television,not_removed,and they are in their way to losing the latino vote the union vote and if he can fix flint michigan the black vote its like they cant give their base away fast enough
television,not_removed,his outgoing approval was pretty high clinton wasnt obama and people didnt equate her with him she was more establishment than him and her ironic efforts to be more sanderslike came off as weird and insincere
television,not_removed,i believe it was posted in july edit where it was posted to rpolitics on july
television,not_removed,thats because the popular vote is a sham why waste time on something thats just a horse and pony show when the real decisions are made by the electoral college
television,not_removed,so she still won there and without the superdelegates and then during teh main event she fucked it up by not campaigning for the electoral votes in the right places
television,not_removed,never said they didnt but as you admit million votes isnt a small margin as for how the primaries are supposed to work until you guys actually implement a system where all candidates get the same amount of money to spend its never going to be a fair fight trump cheated by making sure he was always in the news with something crazy that the republican base would agree with even if not in public
television,not_removed,this is the same exact rationale for dismissing bernie voters in the primary oh ffsshe won by like million votes yeah early on super tuesday on march in many southern states primarily with the black vote in which we all know that democrats dont have a snowballs chance in hell of helping you in november when we pointed that out the claims of racism started pouring in
television,not_removed,ec system is in place to prevent one state from controlling all the elections its how it was designed this is only partially correct the ec was designed specifically to give slave states more power in the executive branch just like the three fifths compromise was designed to give slave states more power in the legislature the sideeffect is that it gives less populous states which when it was drafted were slave states more power but the goalthe designwas only to prop up slavery even back then slavery was a divisive issue without these mechanisms propping it up those who believed in freedom would have overwhelmed the slavers a century earlier
television,not_removed,the ec has merit in that the most populated place dont simply control the entire election however the flip side to that is that majority of americans in this election wanted the other candidate the whole system is imperfect
television,not_removed,we where talking primaries pay attention edit fact are bad right guys just in case and she won cali by
television,not_removed,actually im pretty sure that wasnt true once all the votes came in here mil vs mil edit not to say she wasnt a bad candidate especially after years of the republicans trying to pin anything they can on her and her not just fucking apologising for the server thing years ago etc
television,not_removed,yes if you remove of the total population the vote changes if we picked other states that amounted to the same percentage hrc would have won you cannot set aside any of the legally cast votes
television,not_removed,if you deduct texas hillarys popular vote win is even bigger
television,not_removed,im still waiting to hear back why all those sanders supporters had their reigstrations changed without authorization too
television,not_removed,concentrated effort from the dnc and msm working together to do a media blackout on bernie please stop spreading conspiracy theories when it was between hillary and obama hillary also had the upper hand then the difference was obama had a positive image in the news as a senator and long before he announced his candidacy for president something that bernie sanders didnt have ive read a lot of positive things about bernie sanders but why are we only reading about them now hes been in the game for so long and yet someone the likes of elizabeth warren has better coverage on her carreer than all his years being on politics not to mention how he ran as an outsider and didnt officially join the democratic party until last year look at it from the dncs point of view would you really support someone who only alleged himself to your side until the very last minute i mean cmon
television,not_removed,that sort of explains the problem make america great again is nonsense but everyone knows thats trumps slogan and reagans before him
television,not_removed,of course her main problem is not that in particular but the source she didnt put in as much work in certain states because she assumed it would be easy and realistically it should be its donald fucking trump the birther and national joke for many years
television,not_removed,i dont think so moderates would have actually listened to the entire quote in context as well as consider his voting record when it comes to aiding the poor whites of his constituency i dont doubt that the quote lost him a significant number of votes but it wasnt from moderates
television,not_removed,given that thats obviously a contradiction of everything else he saysworks for i have no clue why someone is too stupid to realize that he simply misspoke there
television,not_removed,it really just goes to show how much we need to get rid of both the republicans and the democrats as they really dont represent anyone but themselves any more
television,not_removed,ive found that the closer you get to the middle the less social issues seem to matter most moderate conservatives and moderate liberals essentially hold the notion of marry who you want carry whatever gun you want smoke whatever we dont care and its not the federal governments business what differentiates the two are economic policies stances on foreign relations and the level of involvement the federal government should have when solving these problems not to sound unsympathetic and cold but the sooner we can put social and cultural topics on a back burner the better it will be for american politics
television,not_removed,yeah because there hasnt been turmoil in the middle east since islam was founded it has nothing to do with sectarian conflict between sunni and shia muslims that has raged since pretty much the day mohammed died no it is us foreign policy over maybe the last years that is responsible for all evil in the world dont get me wrong the west must bear serious responsibility for the chaos in the middle east today toppling secular dictators to leave the country in control of a litany of islamist terror groups is hardly a recipe for regional stability but western involvement is a symptom of already existing conflicts rather than the cause of them the west realised it could back certain sides in already existing conflicts to further their own agendas in the region but its difficult to manipulate people who dont want to fight into fighting each other its been said countless times before but ill say it again there arent christians going around throwing gays off of buildings stoning rape victims to death or murdering apostates christianity underwent a reformation it progressed away from a literal interpretation of the bible which islam has not yet so ensconced are the left in identity politics that they cant countenance the notion that a minority group can and should be worthy of criticism when the values they espouse are so incompatible with ours
television,not_removed,you dont get murdered if you draw a sketch of jesus dude get real
television,not_removed,not neccesarily the us but since the end of the ottoman empire i would say
television,not_removed,could have been written in shit by the marquis desade still doesnt alter the fact that its pretty much spot on dont get me wrong i wouldnt piss on trump if his hamster pelt was on fire and i think anyone who voted trump just out of dislike for hilary has a hole in the head but the fact is plain and visible to all who look hilary fucked her own pooch and the dnc gave her all the help she needed to do it clinton is the one who was driving that bus when it went into the ditch
television,not_removed,thats a useless ad hominem attack his arguments not where he posts
television,not_removed,she did say she couldnt sign it the way it was drafted if that woulda held up well never know
television,not_removed,i agree that the dems have catered too much to ws im not sure if its a eitheror thing though but here is the troubling reality for civically minded liberals looking to justify their preferred strategies hillary clinton talked about the working class middleclass jobs and the dignity of work constantly and she still lost she detailed plans to help coal miners and steel workers she had decades of ideas to help parents particularly working moms and their children she had plans to help young men who were getting out of prison and old men who were getting into new careers she talked about the dignity of manufacturing jobs the promise of cleanenergy jobs and the obama administrations record of creating privatesector jobs for a recordbreaking number of consecutive months she said the word job more in the democratic national convention speech than trump did in the rnc acceptance speech she mentioned the word jobs more during the first presidential debate than trump did she offered the most comprehensively progressive economic platform of any presidential candidate in history—one specifically tailored to an economy powered by an educated workforce whats more the evidence that clinton lost because of the nations economic disenchantment is extremely mixed some economists found that trump won in counties affected by trade with china but among the percent of voters who said economics was the most important issue in the election clinton beat trump by double digits in the vast majority of swing states voters said they preferred clinton on the economy if the election had come down to economics exclusively the working class—which by any reasonable definition includes the black hispanic and asian working classes too—would have elected hillary clinton president the more frightening possibility for liberals is that clinton didnt lose because the white working class failed to hear her message but precisely because they did hear it trumps white voters do support the mommy state but only so long as its mothering them most of them dont seem eager to change medicare or social security but theyre fine with repealing obamacare and its more diverse pool of million insured people theyre happy for the government to pick winners and losers so long as beleaguered coal and manufacturing companies are in the winners circle massive deficitfinanced spending on infrastructure under obama that was dangerous government overreach but under trump its a jobs plan by a guy they know wont let muslims and mexicans cut in line to get work renovating highways and airports many liberals—including those who supported clinton enthusiastically those who supported her only grudgingly and even those who didnt vote—share a vision for americas future call it pluralist social democracy in other words most leftofcenter people would like the us to move toward a more europeanstyle system of universal health care subsidized education and childcare and greater support for those born in poverty or displaced by globalization thats social democracy but unlike in many european countries they also want to see these values combined with a distinctly american flavor of pluralism support for immigration reform criminaljustice reform and a celebration of americas multiethnic culture after the election some people called for an end to identity politics that promotes niche cultural issues over economic policy but any reasonable workingclass platform requires the advancement of policies that may disproportionately help nonwhites for example hundreds of thousands of black men stay out of the labor force after being released from prison sentences for nonviolent crimes for them and their families criminal justice reform is essential economic reform even if poor whites see it as a distraction from the real issues that bedevil the working class like trade policy the longterm future of the us involves rising diversity rising inequality and rising redistribution the combination of these forces makes for an unstable and unpredictable system income stagnation and inequality encourage policies to redistribute wealth from a rich few to the anxious multitudes but when that multitude includes minorities who are seen as benefiting disproportionately from those redistribution policies the white majority can turn resentful this may be one reason why the most successful social democracies as in scandinavia were initially almost all white nobody has really figured out how to be an effective messenger for pluralist social democracy except perhaps for one of the few american adults who is legally barred from running for the us presidency in the future so the country is wobbling between two extremely different futures pluralist social democracy on the one hand and white nativist protectionism on the other the elections bizarre schism with clinton winning the popular vote and trump winning the electoral college is a sign of how razorthin the margin between those dramatically opposed futures is rising diversity isnt going away income inequality isnt going away support for redistribution isnt going away for liberals pluralist social democracy is the project of the future and any alternative falls somewhere between xenophobic and amoral but what if the vast majority of white voters who voted for trump arent interested in any version of that future no matter who the messenger is
television,not_removed,every single time that comment is copy and pasted redditors fall over themselves to suck off the writer the first time it was posted it hit and was gilded times this is the new normal reddit was brogressive around now its heading more to the right my theory is that most of these guys who claim to be liberal but stop talking about minorities gays women are conservatives in denial and will embrace their new party once they get older
television,not_removed,ding ding ding they should have ignored that man child instead of putting everything he said under a magnifying glass
television,not_removed,that was also partially hillarys doing she just didnt realise how spectacularly it would backfire source im gonna pull a theory out of my ass here given that trump and the clintons used to be buddies maybe they asked him to run to sabotage the gop but he turned around and fucked them over theres maybe a chance of that being true but its fun to think about
television,not_removed,they gave him a lot of coverage because they are where talking shit about him
television,not_removed,ive been banned from there forever as well as from rnews rworldnews rpics and others for making protrump comments during the campaigns reddit is a joke
television,not_removed,i got banned from rasktrumpsupporters for having a reasonable discussion about climate change they dont believe in it everyone wants their safe space it seems
television,not_removed,i like the people that are conflating themselves with an imaginary space rebellion best of all oh youre the rebel alliance now you got nerf guns and dildos it aint happening
television,not_removed,obama has more charm and charisma in his left pinkie toe than clinton has in her whole body clinton is an insincere establishment politician who is best friends with wall street and has a number of scandals yeah considering the distrust in the government is at a year high thats a terrible candidate people keep trying to conjure up any reason to defend the clinton loss but she was just not a good candidate and blew elections in a row now
television,not_removed,first female president would have been historic as well just saying
television,not_removed,except that she got the that she was polling at while trump got more then he polled at so the poll was wrong then
television,not_removed,even though his ultra conservative persona was a joke on the colbert report i feel like he brought a more diverse opinion in a way he actually challenged his guests even if was for the sake of comedy by being over the top he made you realize the absurdity by being absurd now he just feels preachy
television,not_removed,his sisters run for senate was financed by john and tony podesta
television,not_removed,you trusted a late night comedian to bring you both sides and perspective on nuanced political issues are you still in high school
television,not_removed,hes always been liberal and trump is easily one of the most incompetent men to ever hold office its a goldmine of shit to make fun of
television,not_removed,that comedians be comedians and political commentators be political commentators i dont think its that much to ask its like they forgot why they are famous in the first place
television,not_removed,explain this sandbagging to me explain what exposed it
television,not_removed,i mean he would have trump would have lost about basically every single candidate except clinton
television,not_removed,i wasam a huge bernie supporter and i understand that more democrats wanted clinton its just true and pretty overwhelmingly so in the biggest states i certainly resent the dnc for their actions but they did not decide the election and its loser talk to claim they did
television,not_removed,ive seen pretty widespread denial of reddit from people who have done nothing but blame the voters
television,not_removed,thats glenn becks channel
television,not_removed,the blaze isnt a good source
television,not_removed,you know those emails the russians and wikileaks found in the dnc hacks well theyre online so just google them
television,not_removed,legal is a dubious thing to use as a standard obama legally bombed libya trump legally didnt pay taxes and police legally have killed people on camera wrongly
television,not_removed,it was not legal there are laws governing how money is distributed by joint fundraising committees those laws were blatantly ignored by the hillary victory fund
television,not_removed,everything i stated is verifiable fact maybe you need to learn how to do research and think critically about what you read on the internet
television,not_removed,unless he starts reading the right stuff like you
television,not_removed,how she had more money than trump all the media except fox news entirely in her corner i will agree that voter suppression played a role in her loss and the gop deserves almost all of the blame for that
television,not_removed,rig manage or conduct something fraudulently so as to produce a result or situation that is advantageous to a particular person the dnc conducted a fraudulent primary
television,not_removed,and the hillary campaign did not engage the right voters to win the right states campaign money and resources were being spent in states where it seemed illogical for her even win there she did not campaign enough in the rust belt and she did not have the right message in the rust belt actionreaction she did not make take the proper actions to get the desired reaction
television,not_removed,its not if you think it is you either havent read it dont understand how laws work in the united states or have been paying too much attention to fake news stopped right there
television,not_removed,nor will i but i have lost count of the number of hillary supporters i have talked to some who paid her money every month and didnt vote on election day i have not run into that story from trump supporters
television,not_removed,no that was the black and hispanic working class look at the breakdown by race
television,not_removed,because the voters didnt want hillary the voters wanted change they wanted someone who wasnt the same old same old obama rode in on a wave of change it never really materialized majorly hillary wasnt that sanders could have been there are so many political analysts that should have seen that hillary was a poor choice there are super delegates in place to ensure the dnc could change partway though the process yet the dnc colluded to have hillary be the candidate it was her turn trump won the primaries despite a majority of high ranking republicans coming out against him hillary and the dnc even supported trumps primary race as they thought he would be easy to beat yet trump still kept gaining momentum at some point you have to see the train coming towards you and realize youre not going to stop it without something directly opposing it
television,not_removed,what no i am saying a relative handful of dems voted for nader while a large amount voted for bush
television,not_removed,left
television,not_removed,four decades nothing but net
television,not_removed,and he has a pony named whiskey
television,not_removed,not really she stoleas in rigged the primaries amid serious administrative scandal she had no right to be the dncs nominee in the general election trump is a lousy excuse for an american but hillary actively undermined the democratic process
television,not_removed,for those on the coasts sure
television,not_removed,how much did all those drone strikes and bombs cost i bet it was more than billion
television,not_removed,yes pensions social security and medicare are all fucked all i keep reading is how pension funds are underfunded even with the stock markets at all time highs getting the debt down now is going to be near impossible but shitty policy let it get so high now we have to deal with it but on another note this isnt really a us only problem every country right now has a rather shocking national debt i guess thats what happens when you let central banks have the keys to the castle
television,not_removed,she played racial politics while bernie played class politics bernie would have been better for lower class minorities than her but clinton and her dnc smeared him as a racist white male for months and he lost the minority vote by huge margins then in the general she got a reality check when poor whites didnt vote for her there was an overlap between sanders and trump in that poor whites were excited by both of them for talking about jobs outsourcing and crony capitalism
television,not_removed,that depends is the goal to enshrine hillary or a democratic win for the presidency both could not have happened that much was clear from the start
television,not_removed,what is your point
television,not_removed,that was the problem an ignoring of the blue wall she kept trying to flip red states towards the end and no message her message was im not trump trump is trump for all his faults knows how to work the media and sell his bullshit he sold his message one soundbite at a time
television,not_removed,the democratic party wont need white people to vote for them in years
television,not_removed,the idea that shifting demographics will lead to left wing parties winning elections is widely considered bunk by political analysts if anyone is wondering a wealthy established latino or hispanic majority will be as right wing as a wealthy established white majority
television,not_removed,video edit guys im not calling the op a liar i agree with the sentiments of the post im asking if theres a video because id be curious to watch it
television,not_removed,strange then that she completely forgot to hold onto that states she needed to win ec and instead try to push in texas and arizona
television,not_removed,so super delegates are fine when its a dnc playfield who she controlled but when the national level super delegates dont vote for her she won anyway
television,not_removed,i mean i agree that elections should be publicly funded privately funding elections is a huge subversion of democracy that has literally nothing to do with the steps the dnc took to undermine bernie sanders are you really trying to say that because our current system doesnt allow for all candidates to get equal funding that its ok for the dnc to work to undermine a candidate in their own primary
television,not_removed,sanders raised more money than clinton and it still wasnt a fair fight because the dnc and media were working against sanders
television,not_removed,luckily california doesnt rule our country and since clintons entire lead was with in california she won by million votes she doesnt win because of that
television,not_removed,bit nitpicky but not a majority just more raw numbers than the other candidate whoever would have won most voters end up with a president they did not wantvote for which is kinda sucky and a reason the system should be looked at harder also million wasnt it less than
television,not_removed,you can if you want to better understand why you lost the actual election and develop strategies not to do it again
television,not_removed,and yet i believe trump still would win via electoral college in that scenario
television,not_removed,theres nothing conspiracy theory about it
television,not_removed,its not a conspiracy theory there is evidence that supports these claims you are just choosing to ignore it there is literally evidence that clinton staff messaged reporters and told them how to spin stories on bernie sanders even one email were clinton staff directed the media to question his faith if you werent on the right side of history you would be just as bad as the trump people youre so sure of yourself and so self righteous with your convictions that you cant even bother to open your eyes when there is evidence that runs contrary to your belief bubble shame on you you should know better
television,not_removed,well that and the most valuable commodity a candidate has is their time and hillary killed a bunch of it in california where the electoral votes were locked up and didnt spend that much time in the midwest battleground states it was a great plan if the popular vote mattered but it didnt just a really stupid campaign by an uncharismatic candidate
television,not_removed,this two sides of the same coin the best thing to come out of this election is no more bushes or clintons
television,not_removed,not to sound unsympathetic and cold but the sooner we can put social and cultural topics on a back burner the better it will be for american politics not gonna happen were still fighting over roe v wade and that shit was decided years ago north carolina tried to legalize discrimination against transgender people the president might implement the first amendment act or we its called which is bad news for advocates of social progress whether to be due to americas obsession with guns or god we are in for the long haul on social topics
television,not_removed,the moderates just arent active enough im willing to bet most politicians are exactly moderate but they are slaves to their constituents who call i forgot where i read it but the nra is actually losing members yearly but they mobilize their people to call their politicians when anything related to gun issues are presented half the time congress presents super watered down gun laws that definitely will not take guns away from anyone but they still lose look it sopa a few years ago everyone called and barely and congress flipped out and killed that version of it calling gets their attention
television,not_removed,i feel like it takes too much time to be a moderate educated voter it takes time to read news stories contact your representatives be involved and form your opinion based on evidence and fact what doesnt take time is hopping over to rthedonald or renoughtrumpspam and skimming the top posts confirming your biases and moving on with your day insert whatever news source you want here fox news mother jones breitbart liberalconservative sections of twitter and this is in my opinion what the majority of people do confirm their bias get riled up at anyone who would dare think differently yell at those who think differently and move on
television,not_removed,christianity underwent a reformation it progressed away from a literal interpretation of the bible i keep hearing this but to be clear the reformation had little or nothing to do with the progressing away from a literal interpretation of the bible those are two different things having little to do with another luther was if anything far more wedded to a literal interpretation of the bible and to a purely biblebased view of the world than those he broke away from and even today biblical literalists are more likely to be found among evangelicals ie the heirs of luthers and calvins protestant reforms than other christians moreover note that christians httpsenwikipediaorgwikicircumcisioncontroversyinearlychristianity we know this because large portions of the new testament refer to the topic and the theological justification for doing so this is a sharp contrast with mainstream islam which regards the qurans moral codes eg amputation of a thiefs right hand as eternal and not subject to change or reinterpretation
television,not_removed,iran and iraq used to be liberal democracies negative american interference made those societies retreat into hyper religious reactionary and defensive positions
television,not_removed,no one trusted her to hold to any of the promises partly why she couldnt sell herself as president
television,not_removed,what a ridiculous puff piece i wonder how many favours the democrats called in to get this one written sure if your premise is that nothing can be done about income inequality and it is an inevitable fact of nature then the anger at democrats doesnt make sense but income inequality isnt inevitable and is exacerbated by the neoliberal economic policies of the current democratic party she offered the most comprehensively progressive economic platform of any presidential candidate in history—one specifically tailored to an economy powered by an educated workforce yes this is the common liberal solution to income inequality basically the only one they offer but increasing education has not led to greater income equality it is a solution that educated democrats like because it allows them to believe they are where they are due to their merit while not really costing them anything but when that multitude includes minorities who are seen as benefiting disproportionately from those redistribution policies the white majority can turn resentful that is not accurately capturing the extend of the problem hillary clinton said it wasnt that important to break up the big banks because it wouldnt end sexism and racism so ending the income inequality and economic injustice is less important to her than helping minorities of course it is far easier for her to think poor white racists are the problem when she has so many close ties to the banks and makes so much money from them hillary and the democrats are making a choice to say income inequality is inevitable if they hadnt done that i dont think trump would have even come close to power
television,not_removed,you are part of the problem throwing two labels as if everyone has to fit its the one thing that is very telling in any politically fueled discussion when someone just points the finger and starts calling people conservativeliberal its pathetic on all fronts
television,not_removed,but then they couldnt curry favor with clinton by putting the one person who she could easily beat in the opposition seat
television,not_removed,aka suggesting that he should run for president
television,not_removed,i made a joke about trump on a trump subreddit the people there took it as a joke and we all moved on now because i made this joke about trump i was ban from roffmychest rpics and so on crazy huh
television,not_removed,no rnews no rworldnews i would expect that your reddit experience has improved substantially
television,not_removed,the best part is they werent protrump comments im basically like bill politically speaking hated both parties this cycle specifically the way the dems primaries were conducted
television,not_removed,and of course this meaningless comparison is the only upvoted answer bloody pricks
television,not_removed,part of the reason i didnt support her was that i didnt want america to forever have to remember hillary clinton the first female president the first woman to hold that office should be an inspiration not a yeah but shes not as bad as the other guy candidate
television,not_removed,so the poll was wrong then no your understanding of how statistics work is wrong pay more attention in school next time math is important
television,not_removed,part of the reason why that show got such great ratings was his ability to make you feel like he was on your side and actually making fun of the other side regardless of what side you were on
television,not_removed,i agree a lot of the time his conservative position provoked guests into having to rethink their position or more clearly define their terms and he did it with amazing good humor i also think he realizes that if he doesnt do exactly what hes doing then its professional suicide even if you are colbert the trump presidency is going to have to kill bin ladin a couple of times before it becomes possible to mention him without hissing
television,not_removed,do you live in isolation or something
television,not_removed,if you hear people blaming the voters just quote this people want leadership and in the absence of genuine leadership theyll listen to anyone who steps up to the microphone they want leadership theyre so thirsty for it theyll crawl through the desert toward a mirage and when they discover theres no water theyll drink the sand
television,not_removed,the blaze is glenn becks trash fire
television,not_removed,i did i saw them prefer her nothing about rigging anything action wise
television,not_removed,i agree context matters
television,not_removed,so hillary deserves all the blame for cheating bernie but she also deserves all the blame for being cheated by trump makes sense
television,not_removed,no it didnt provide a single bit of evidence
television,not_removed,they didnt change voting results
television,not_removed,unwilling to even pretend to participate in actual debate alright dude have a good one
television,not_removed,they didnt want bernie though if they did they wouldve showed up in primaries
television,not_removed,they wanted change so much he won the popular vote byfuck never mind
television,not_removed,i set that one up didnt i
television,not_removed,theres no way youre gonna be an actor
television,not_removed,ok i dont agree with that but even if thats true wouldnt you agree her presidency would be much less crazy and destructive in its first week than trumps
television,not_removed,which is most people of the country live in just counties that touch the shoreline
television,not_removed,that she uses weasel words to avoid any direct question about her integrity or anything shady she did while in office
television,not_removed,they got so used to people voting against someone instead of for someone that they forgot they needed to offer promises as well as attacks
television,not_removed,the fact they think that all or most black brown or yellow people are somehow ensured or obligated to vote left wing is absurd that level of entitlement leads to the sort of complacency that loses elections like the last one for example they have learned nothing at all you still have to campaign for them the voters dont owe you their vote you have to earn it
television,not_removed,i cant find it i tried before on the day it aired and i couldnt find it it was definitely on new day or the show after that though because thats what i watch every morning
television,not_removed,texas was a waste of her time the number of church ladys that walk into the voting booth and select straight republican ticket is staggering
television,not_removed,money doesnt matter as much as youd think i bet money that trump would win around august but of what i was seeing on facebook twitter and reddit more than that i looked at every state and counties that voted in the primaries and based my guess on just the raw numbers then i started reading the wikileaks the only thing that awed me more than the dncs dismissal of the american public was the juggernaut that was the clinton machine there were armies of lawyers protestors political action groups all in support of hillary i thought i was in trouble of losing my bet due to the sheer size of the machine that was the clintons and the billions of dollars backing her the only thing that won trump was the truth and the main steam media could not control it people are able to read wikileaks for themselves and just from the amount of people trolling shia laboufs livestream im amazed just how many people in just nyc alone know bernie was cheated and seemingly have read the dncpodesta emails
television,not_removed,are you really trying to say that because our current system doesnt allow for all candidates to get equal funding that its ok for the dnc to work to undermine a candidate in their own primary no im saying the contest is already rigged but no one cares unless their candidate loses and the dnc could literally just pick someone out of a hat if they wanted and thats actually closer to how they used to do it before the century what im saying is that they where always playing favourites they just never had leaked emails before but that was an aside about how its supposed to work not an argument about the rest of your post the million people that hillary got was my argument for that
television,not_removed,but did he actually spent more
television,not_removed,luckily california doesnt rule our country and since clintons entire lead was with in california she won by million votes she doesnt win because of that yeah all the votes where from california ignore the states where trump got comparable numbers that would nullify the cali numbers and all the states where hillary got more votes then trump they didnt matter
television,not_removed,a plurality
television,not_removed,hillarys vote lead was three million after everything was counted apparently she received the tenth most votes ever for a president that puts her at most votes ever by someone who lost the electoral votes
television,not_removed,not if you want to feel good about your candidate and your candidate lost though
television,not_removed,that presumes that all of california votes as a block for the same reasons it doesnt work like that which sadly is what experts in most subjects keep needing to explain to trump and his ilk
television,not_removed,the guy i replied to talked about a media blackout which is patently false even your statement runs contrary to the parent comment because thered be nothing to spin if theyre censoring everything about him hes also spreading more and crazier conspiracy theories in this thread everything ive said can be verified by httpsfivethirtyeightcomfeaturesthesystemisntriggedagainstsanders these arent convictions theyre all verifiable news sources that actually end up as pieces of history especially bernies political history before running for president and his unexpected candidacy confirmed by the dnc themselves lets not forget bernie himself defended clinton during those leaks email conversations that are unverified and untried and speaking of knowing better i think you should also be informed that thats for him against for her before you project your own selfrighteousness and bias at least check the facts first
television,not_removed,doesnt help when everyday and even intelligent people are branded as sexist or anti feminist for not electing her most of all other women
television,not_removed,apparently colin powell said himself that clintons hubris burns everything she touches years ago so theres that
television,not_removed,yes definitely i still cant figure out why she didnt visit wisconsin
television,not_removed,that is such bullshit iran and iraq were never liberal democracies at best they were flawed democracies but even that is giving them too much credit prior to the islamic revolution iran was an authoritarian secular state similar to iraq you need to understand what the meaning of a liberal democracy is
television,not_removed,why did it not impact bernie when he supported those very same social issues his social justice rhetoric was about addressing income inequality healthcare reform and a progressiveliberal social policy hilary decided to take the social justice aspect without actually tying any policy to it whatsoever ran a campaign with some liberallite policies that basically amount to status quo on pretty much all social policies was a hawk on foreign policy and said absolutely nothing on fiscal reform it was like she tried to get all of the gender studies activists on her side while secretly handshaking media wall street and big business and you know being just as hawkish as obama probably more so and bush ever were
television,not_removed,social issues were the only thing clinton really ran on im hilary clinton im a woman vote for me i like hot sauce and have pneumonia if you want to hear my policies visit my website bernie supported equality proper yet knew and openly stated the larger issue is one of economics and actual injustice like being treated differently under the law simply because youre wealthy and powerful
television,not_removed,why did it not impact bernie when he supported those very same social issues how do you know it didnt he did lose after all hillary didnt need to go as hard on social issues in the primary as a woman she was the social issue also they were both playing to the home team registered democrats not to undecidedsmoderatesindependentsetc
television,not_removed,its a much better source that the diatribe i was replying to further upthread the atlantic is evenhanded with a slight favor towards liberal policies hillary clinton said it wasnt that important to break up the big banks because it wouldnt end sexism and racism source nothing can be done about income inequality idk why you keep saying this clinton wanted further regulations on wall street higher taxation on the uber wealthy had a profit sharing plan that incentivized companies sharing with employees force companies that work overseas to give up their tax break and job training for declining skilled workers
television,not_removed,id put down the peace pipe friend my assessment of the political leanings of reddit is based off of the upvoting trends over the last years interesting you chose to attack me for counterjerking but not the guy who just walked out of sean hannity
television,not_removed,true i dont miss it
television,not_removed,a lot of different people did that you really think trump beats obama and sander as well
television,not_removed,wasnt the right female
television,not_removed,i am saying the poll was wrong because the statistics were sourced badly statistics are the weakest form of math because they can be manipulated to show whatever you want as was the case here apparently its ironic that you say my understanding of statistics is wrong when you show a very poor grasp of the subject that google u degree is not so great it seems pot meet kettle
television,not_removed,my voter records were purged here in brooklyn my primary vote didnt count same thing happened to a lot of my friends and they couldnt vote in the primary either we were given affidavit ballots which were thrown out why am i not surprised this didnt make the national news it will be easy for you to find on google be prepared to get angry as hell i know i still am youd be surprised how livid you can get when your vote is taken away i dont know if ill ever get over it
television,not_removed,how was she cheated by trump there was voter suppression by some gop states which had nothing to do with trump but that has been going on for a long time hillary was in a very advantageous position and blew it bernie came from nowhere and got no help except for from us the american people do you really think the two are analogous
television,not_removed,the dnc directly colluded with both hillarys team and the msm to suppress bernies message and his supporters rather than hold a fair primary they were ready to coronate hillary from day as evidenced by her superdelegates other shady examples like this and this and this check out rdncleaks as well
television,not_removed,i dont think you understand the english language
television,not_removed,no anyone who would say that has nothing of value to discuss
television,not_removed,its been this way for ages there could have been changes made there might be in if dems dont vote the ec system has its problems but its designed to take in account all of the states not just the most populous ones
television,not_removed,bam hes an actor and a governor your move god
television,not_removed,she shouldnt have used a private email server but her life has demonstrated an order of magnitude more integrity than her opponent several orders of magnitude
television,not_removed,makes you wonder why a certain side generally favors open boarders and is passive towards illegal immigration
television,not_removed,thats such a ridiculous statement theres no point refuting it
television,not_removed,apparently the dems think white blue collar workers are just gonna vanish in a decade jesus fuck they are dumb
television,not_removed,trump had billions in free publicity by giving the media ratings gold to talk about
television,not_removed,my point is everyone brings up that she won by million votes but never mentions that were it not for winning california by million she would have lost the popular vote its made to sound like it was the whole country voting for her heavily and trump snuck in some heavy electoral states when in reality trump won all the important states that dont reliably go one way
television,not_removed,im sorry he out raised her if you dont count money from super pacs the media wasnt completely blacked out no one is naive enough to believe or make the assumption that clinton controlled the entire media thats ridiculous but there was a coordinated effort to attack sanders and limit his media exposure by not speaking to journalists that posted favorable articles about him by limiting the number of debates and by scheduling the debates on days where people dont normally watch television the dnc made every attempt to publicly seem neutral but privately aid clinton use some critical thinking skills and reason please humor me let me take this play by play and start from the beginning the dnc leadership did not like bernie sanders they saw his campaign as an insurgency most of their careers were already hitched to clinton she was the establishment candidate if she lost their future careers were in jeopardy just as no one thought trump stood a chance no one thought bernie stood a chance but as people became more aware of struggling middleclass voters coming out en masse those opinions gradually changed as the clinton team began to see sanders poll numbers and donations made a drastic increase in november they drastically changed their campaign strategy to create an aura of inevitability they started with limiting access to the press clinton aids hand picked reporters they would answer questions for and give stories to and only allowed a handful on the campaign trail this meant that only press approved by the clinton team were able to travel or have access that meant that the only way to stay relevant in the news cycle or report on politics was to post articles favorable to the clinton camp or risk being cut off the clinton camp also stopped all press conferences as of december to limit exposure to reporters and journalists that might as nonapproved questions once the clinton camp set up the narrative and were able to steer the media they began coordinating with the dnc for help the chair of the dnc coordinated with clinton to pressure super delegates into announcing support for clinton prior to a single vote being cast this created a hurdle for the sanders campaign as the media began to question how sanders who was behind her in the polls could beat her by a large enough margin to overcome her super delegate advantage the dnc actively pushed close primaries and denied requests to open primaries up working with the clinton campaign they created the narrative that independents like bernie werent democrats and thus they werent eligible for many primaries in the primaries that were closed the dnc created barriers for the sanders campaign because they required that voters switch their registered party to democrat by as early as october which was before sanders even gained steam simultaneously the dnc drastically limited the number of debates they also scheduled the debates to take place on days that americans dont typically watch tv this was to limit sanders exposure to the voters clinton being a house hold name was her biggest strength if sanders message gained even more traction or exposure he could easily catch up as the debates began and specific policies began being debated the clinton camp scrambled to distract attention away from democratic party and critique the republican party to do this they pushed the narrative that candidates like donald trump and ted cruz were not just dangerous but entirely possible this is where trump gained media traction from the clinton camp saying the dangerous things trump had said and that we must come together against him this also created the effect of negative emotions when criticizing within our party in spring the sanders campaign began to out raise clinton even with super pacs figured in to combat this the dnc created a fund for state candidates and presidential candidates where if presidential candidates raised money with individual states the presidential candidate would receive a portion of the donation well the percent of the cut that the clinton camp got proved to be much greater than the dnc or media was saying as they got a large majority in some cases up to of the funds they raised this allowed them to stay competitive with the sanders campaign with the closed primaries and unrealistic party declaration deadlines sanders lost ground in terms of delegates meanwhile he was gaining traction in every national poll the media coverage of donald trump limited sanders exposure even though he was attracting crowds even larger than trumps they would play sound bites from trump then have a response from a clinton rally the media would sometimes cover sanders rallies yet fail to mention that clintons had attendees and sanders had towards the middleend of the primary the message from the dnc and clinton camp was that she was the inevitable candidate and the party had to come together to defeat donald trump but ill attempt to remind everyone that she was only inevitable because her campaign subverted the democratic process that donald trump being taken legitimately was a result of strategic coordination with top level officials of the dnc and members of the media and that even though all evidence pointed to sanders beating trump by larger margins the establishment was creating dissent within the party aimed at the sanders camp for prolonging the primary process and not accepting clintons inevitability the convention
television,not_removed,not many answers other than hubris they thought they had it in the bag and they were highsteppin towards the endzone and fumbled on the
television,not_removed,the real answer is because wisconsin and michigan havent gone red in years all the polls reinforced that those two states would again go blue and that she had a huge lead in pennsylvania but turns out the polls were historically wrong its easy to say she should have went there in hindsight but nobody could have predicted she would lose those states its the same reason why people dont fault trump for not campaigning in louisiana or oklahoma for the general
television,not_removed,iran only became an authoritarian state after a cia driven coup ousted the democratically elected leader mossadeg and imposed the authocratic shah iraqs baath party was originally socialist and even authorized the creation of a communist party at some point the point is women used to wear short skirts out in public in these countries and western aggression made these societies presume negative attitudes towards a lot of western things
television,not_removed,that still doesnt address his point really the original post is acting as if clinton supporting those social justice causes is the reason why she lost the reason why she lost and wasnt able to turn out voters especially millennials was because she was incredibly milquetoast on those issues blm couldnt stand her so i dont see why people are acting like she tried at any point to appease them yeah she ran a couple donald trump is sexist ads which he is but to pretend clinton was the sjw candidate is just incredibly tone deaf and tells me you dont actually know whats going on sanders was the sjw candidate because he actually had solutions to those issues so when you blame sjws on clinton losing youre also implying sanders would have lost as well and im putting sjws in quotes because its a silly fucking phrase
television,not_removed,i understand the points being made i really do but why do commenters here keep putting social justice in quotes as if to delegitimize it its an important thing to pursue regardless of the candidate or political party sure the term has been demonized by tumblr keyboard warriors but the ideas that activists like mlk and maya angelou fought for are still crucial regardless of the economy
television,not_removed,if you want to hear my policies visit my website and that also was a massive blunder on her part old people by and large dont use the internet old people by and large vote she shouldve had a hotline to call in addition to her website
television,not_removed,the atlantic is evenhanded with a slight favor towards liberal policies maybe in general idk why you keep saying this because the whole article you posted falls apart if that isnt true idk why you keep saying this clinton wanted further regulations on wall street higher taxation on the uber wealthy had a profit sharing plan that incentivized companies sharing with employees force companies that work overseas to give up their tax break and job training for declining skilled workers she also wanted to continue the legacy of obama and her husband who were both well known for pretending to care about income inequality
television,not_removed,she really wasnt though give me elizabeth warren and ill vote for her in a heartbeat i was a big sanders supporter and id take her over him
television,not_removed,id be pissed in your case but i doubt million were purged i hated them too dont get me wrong but its just another deflategate with bernie fans as colts fans its cheating and bs but she and the pats still wouldve clearly won
television,not_removed,so youre saying hrc worked with the dnc to purge democrats from the voter rolls in new york you have to know that makes zero sense right
television,not_removed,none of that supports anything you said
television,not_removed,i know what rig means did the dnc prevent people from voting for bernie you forgot a period
television,not_removed,which gives less populous states a disproportionate representation just like the senate though not to such an extreme
television,not_removed,america will be a minority majority country by
television,not_removed,if only the clinton camp didnt ask to play trump up as the piped piper candidate
television,not_removed,if only the clinton camp didnt ask to play trump up as the piped piper candidate
television,not_removed,and if trump hadnt won texas by less then million hillary would have gotten electoral votes you make it sound like everyone voted for trump in all the states he won etc see it works both ways and its not like trump didnt get a lot of votes from states that go red reliably which when added up would probably be enough to counter the cali votes or maybe not since its likely more people voted for hillary in those states because trump isnt exactly what an evangelical voter would think of as a great candidate but that only shows that your point about cali is mistaken since the normal countering of the votes didnt happen in historically very red states
television,not_removed,there werent enough state polls in the midwest to show how in trouble she was
television,not_removed,obama visited wisconsin times during his run
television,not_removed,so when you blame sjws on clinton losing youre also implying sanders would have lost as well im not making that claim im addressing a single point which was why did it not impact bernie when he supported those very same social issues because the post above didnt seem to understand what the difference between bernie sanders social justice rhetoric and clintons if you want my actual viewpoint its this clinton was a dreadful candidate the wrong person at the wrong time she dropped the ball on millenials who were drawn to bernies big blue social liberalist policies she dropped the ball on black voters who didnt trust her any further than her wall street lined pockets she dropped the ball on the rust buckle states where the democrats should have held on to because no fucking way she was going to redraft trade agreements that she was sitting in on to benefit the very people fucked over by them in the first place she dropped the ball on every single major issue there were states that bled red that were never going to vote for her purely because she was a clinton a democrat a woman but those werent her swing votes she trailed every single demographic she should have had because in a pinch she lacked charisma charm friendliness and that easygoing character that americans want to see in a candidate you cant put the woman who to pander to black voters next to barack obama it doesnt matter that shes the candidate to become president on paper what counts is what you do and when you make statements about keeping your personal and public life separate sit in on trade agreements try and play checkmate like a fucking warhound with other superpowers in a political climate crucially opposed to unchecked militarism and not come to the table with anything new exciting or hopeful youre not going to inspire people to the voting booth with an im with her sticker also what the fuck is that slogan im with her well im fucking not she didnt magically earn any respect on the basis of her second x chromosome she didnt stand on podiums making a stand against unchecked greed hatred and bloodshed she went down to swing states and tried to remind them how bad the other guy was well thats not how you win an argument mrs clinton gods i need to get off my soapbox
television,not_removed,reddit hates social justice despite having a great affinity for bernie sanders who is basically king sjw which is why i like him the idea that hillary clinton the woman who yelled at blm protestors and kicked them out of her event is a sjw is laughable sjw is a pejorative for anyone who wants to make social progress it used to refer to small number of crazy teenagers that comprise the majority of tumblrinaction submissions but has branched out to encompass most liberal policy reddit is basically a bunch of sqws status quo warriors except when it comes to muh weed and muh privacy
television,not_removed,she was really trying for millennials with the groovy funky web site like the hip kids have but hell you could almost hear the stampede getting the fuck away from her as she uttered pokemon go to the polls just some of the most clunky political posturing ive ever seen
television,not_removed,so she didnt say what you claimed she did im reading it as a misguided attempt to say that income equality wont solve other problems which is true im sure trump will fix things better though by increasing taxes on the middle class and furthering the already shitty health insurance costs how do you propose to fix economic inequality
television,not_removed,similar shady things happened in a lot of places not just brooklyn and this was the primaries not the general election youre mentioning with the million there are two important things to consider one by not nominating the most popular candidate in the primary theyre by definition hurting their chances in the general election two and this crucially compounds with the first point if you play fuck games with democracy youre going to piss off a lot of people who would have voted for you if you played fairly on top of that there decadeslong concerns about her trustworthiness that she was fighting during the primaries and election it worked against everything she was doing to ease those fears with the very people she needed to vote for her so many bad decisions and honestly if it hadnt happened to me id think it was probably a fluke but when its you suddenly its very very real i agree with you about the pats thing and im a colts fan the metaphor in this case though is far too over simplified lots of things at work in this case
television,not_removed,i dont think the boss always makes the calls and the boss wouldnt be too smart and last as long as she has if she was dumb enough to have a paper trail but the boss sets the culture and they hire people who run the organization it also didnt bode well that she hired dws after she was forced to resign the dnc by the potus it shows that shes willing to work with people who do shady things and lose their jobs because of it the whole thing just reinforced a perception thats been around for decades that the clintons dont always play within the lines
television,not_removed,not sure you do buddy
television,not_removed,ok even if thats the case youre cutting out a large percentage of americans and assuming all minorities are going to vote for a democrat plus is not years from now there are going to be several elections before the demographics change potentially in the democrats favor even then id be surprised if every election after will end in a victory for the dems also this attitude is really antiprogressive we wont change but the people voting for us will
television,not_removed,heh guess they underestimated the number of rats and children because thats also a part of that story
television,not_removed,yet she had people in the states telling her she had problems but she was too arrogant and stupid to listen her ny office thought they were smarter than they were all that money bought a lot of incompetence
television,not_removed,the gop data operation seemed to have it spot on
television,not_removed,no dude stay on your soapbox because i couldnt agree more with you but i see what youre saying more clearly now i thought you were implying her embracing social justice was the reason she lost i agree with you i still voted for her and was hoping shed win she would have been a better president but im not blind to the fact that she didnt deserve to win if that makes any sense at all
television,not_removed,im reading it as a misguided attempt to say that income equality wont solve other problems which is true but that in combination with the focus of her campaign makes it seem like sexism is the more important issue im sure trump will fix things better though by increasing taxes on the middle class and furthering the already shitty health insurance costs of course he wont but he got elected because of major failings on the side of the democratic party and if they continue to repeat them as many will want to things likely wont get better how do you propose to fix economic inequality well a start would have been to break up the big banks and punish those responsible for ruining the economy there are a lot of other pretty radical ideas that could be tried but mainstream economics has far too much vested in the status quo and the democrats have far too many ties to mainstream economists and bankers
television,not_removed,i would certainly argue that they chose the most popular candidate in the primaries the voter count difference between her and bernie was million bernie only won among young whites while hilary had the wide appeal the big tent only issue was turnout was poor i dont really know if bernie wouldve won but i doubt the real appeal of an old white socialist candidate among the public that red scare fear is still real among the old
television,not_removed,why can you guys never answer my question did the dnc prevent million people from voting for bernie sanders did the dnc alter the results to give clinton the nomination
television,not_removed,i think you mean larry
television,not_removed,gary gergich jerry gergich gary gergich jerry gergich god theyre both horrible
television,not_removed,wait until you see his family
television,not_removed,i love jerry too i think the joke was that everyone made fun of him for being old and still stuck in a lowlevel government job without having moved up the ranks hes seen as having no ambition leslie says his life is depressing when jerry asks her if she wants to join him in watching his stories and eating jello its not until seasons and that you learn that jerry doesnt really put much emphasis on his career because his home life to him is what makes him happy its what matters most you see jerry much more confident at home he throws a cup in the air and catches it where as at work where hes constantly being picked on hes more nervous clumsy and constantly screwing up when jerry briefly retires and tom becomes the new jerry you see tom start to make stupid mistakes as well because hes forced in that role
television,not_removed,
television,not_removed,in a world full of assholes theres always a jerry somewhere
television,not_removed,dont worry every dog has his day
television,not_removed,watching the show you see that jerry makes little mistakes all the time that cause headaches for everyone else yes hes a delightful man but he tends to fuck things up donna on the other hand gets shit done and has backups for jerrys screwups
television,not_removed,the characters constant mistreatment of jerry is a reflection of our own lives most people see someone like jerry and laugh at his clumsiness and numerous mistakes hes a great reminder that good people arent perfect and that we need to see their true value in them until they fart in front of everyone in which case just laugh because that shits funny yo
television,not_removed,thats what makes it so funny you cant have all these redeeming characters putting down and making fun of an already miserable character the fact that jerry has an amazing life lets all the other characters constantly rip into it pretty genius
television,not_removed,just wait a few seasons and youll see how lucky his life really is definitely has a satisfying character arc
television,not_removed,is that the fat guy
television,not_removed,no i think you mean terry
television,not_removed,barry
television,not_removed,between the huge cock and the tongue that wont quit theres no doubt gayle is a happy woman
television,not_removed,so does christie brinkley
television,not_removed,its not government work unless you have to do it twice
television,not_removed,probably why ron has kept him on for so long
television,not_removed,youre the fat guy
television,not_removed,isnt his name gary
television,not_removed,shut up jerry
television,not_removed,so this fiasco cost us a closing matt damon bit
television,not_removed,everyone was so quick to blame warren beatty and throw all old people under the bus but he handled himself better than i would have in that situation he knew something was definitely wrong but didnt know what to do it about it with millions of people waiting to hear what he was going to say not an easy situation to navigate to say the least
television,not_removed,denzel even directs the oscars apparently
television,not_removed,as long as we are positive that matt damon lost that was a good night
television,not_removed,the accountant who did this really should lose his job not because he embarrassed some celebrities and did it on a international stage but because if you seriously cant get this simple thing right you are probably also fucking up your clients balance sheets or whatever it is accountants do these days
television,not_removed,jimble kimble
television,not_removed,ok after watching what happened a few times now and seeing all the drama i have to ask if the card said in big bold letters emma stone la la land why wouldnt you ask for guidance from the stage manager a simple excuse us there seems to be a problem with our envelope youve already see emma stone collect the best actress award the best picture oscar wouldnt be awarded to only her then when its rectified sorry ladies and gentlemen we were accidently handed the back up best actress envelope we apologise for any incovenience i get the whole better to be silent and thought a fool than speak out and remove all doubt but fuck me they stood there like rabbits in headlights until someone faye made a stupid decision
television,not_removed,last year there were not enough black nominees this year set a record im sure it was a huge coincidence
television,not_removed,it was done purposely for controversy and so everyone would still be talking about it daysweeks after it doesnt take a genius to see theyre getting desperate for viewers to return
television,not_removed,thats the worst thing out of all of this
television,not_removed,apologies to matt damon we ran out of time
television,not_removed,emma stone saying in the postshow i dont mean to start stuff but i had that card inadvertently added fuel to the fire someone should have told her there are two cards for each category i think that comment led some people to believe that warren made up the story on the spot about being given the wrong card
television,not_removed,apparently beatty and dunaway were feuding backstage about who would read the name and they eventually settled on beatty introducing and the oscar goes to and dunaway saying the title of the film that was why dunaway didnt read the card properly and said the title of the film so fast it could be that she felt that beatty was trying to steal her thunder with that weird pause
television,not_removed,right you could see on his face that he knew something wasnt right as soon as he looked at the card and had definite reservations about announcing it but what was he gonna do really also i get that dudebro was frazzled and nervous but he all kinds of snatched that card from beatty i was like jeez
television,not_removed,its funny how so many people can watch the same thing and still remember it wrong he clearly wasnt the person reading the wrong winner but it seems half the audience remembered him doing it
television,not_removed,he looked like he was everytime they showed him in the crowd
television,not_removed,yeah hes a loser
television,not_removed,its a pretty big fuck up but mistakes do happen and im not quite sure gunning for someone who probably has a family to support and bills to pay to lose their livelihood over it is the right response
television,not_removed,thats the dumbest mindset ive heard everyone makes a simple mistake sooner or later
television,not_removed,what about the two academy people that supposedly stand on each side of the stage to prevent what happened they should have never even let the la la land people on stage let alone let them go through three speeches before someone intervened
television,not_removed,lol everyone makes mistakes yes even the best and highest priced professionals in the world i think you might be overstating the case a litte bit the guy is in deep shit though he was a higher up at pwc and he might end up resigning over this but one fuckup doesnt make him a bad accountant
television,not_removed,in general the oscars are a welloiled machine im sure he put a lot of trust in the people managing the cards a mistake would probably not even occur to him
television,not_removed,it is probably so hard to imagine that you would be handed the wrong card in that moment that your mind does a backflip and goes to mush before last night no one would have even considered it possible that the best picture card would get mixed up seems too impossible of a mistake
television,not_removed,its almost like they expanded the voter pool to make it more diverse
television,not_removed,seven whole nonwhite actors were nominated wont someone think of the white people who have been hurt by this turn of events
television,not_removed,or maybe there were more movies that were deserving of best picture nomination and acting recognition name from last year outside of beast of no nation which got snubbed because of the way netflix released it
television,not_removed,youre not wrong but people are gonna downvote you anyways
television,not_removed,my god a latino man makes an observation that is clearly true and people lose their minds nice
television,not_removed,the academy cares too much about their reputation to fuck something up this badly
television,not_removed,if kimmel was truly witty he would have said that after all of this happened though i suppose that would only add to the confusion and people thinking that the mixup was a prank
television,not_removed,well she should have known that comment helped nobody not sure what she was trying to prove
television,not_removed,she said youre awful to him in kind of a sarcastic way which i always thought to mean that he was playing around with the audience interesting
television,not_removed,apparently beatty and dunaway were feuding backstage about who would read the name paging ryan murphy we found the plot for feud season
television,not_removed,if you watch the clip closely hes trying to prevent the stage manager from grabbing it hes really snatching it from the stage manager to show everyone not trying to snatch it from beatty
television,not_removed,denzel is the ultimate disappointed dad
television,not_removed,you really only fire people over gross negligence no one died over this they were suppose to have procedures in place for this its a time to go back and look over them and see where they failed for example the letter in the envelope says oscars on the top followed by the winners and finally the category in smaller print on the bottom maybe the category should be at the top instead also the envelope is red in color but the category is printed in gold font two colors that can bleed together for all we know warren beatty cant see well so he assumed and rightfully so that the people around him were correct he probably didnt want to bring the letter close to his face to read and embarrase himself maybe the accountant doesnt give the envelope directly to the presenter but to a middle man to double check before hand this isnt a firing moment but a learning experience
television,not_removed,yeah it seems like it was a tragic catastrophe or something get over it people im sure everyone is fine
television,not_removed,thats the accountant not an academy person the only two people who know the winners before theyre announced are the two accountants from pwc youre right that they should have been quicker to try to correct it once the la la land people started heading to the stage but thats probably a hard train to stop once its left the station one if the two accountants should have just immediately ran to the podium and corrected it on the spot but instead they panicked told the producers who told the stage manager who then went on stage and by then they were speeches deep it would have been ugly either way but at least if they ran to the podium and fixed it the la la land people wouldnt have been paraded in stage and given speeches as losers which can be embarrassing although i think they handled it very well so it didnt come off as embarrassing for them
television,not_removed,its not like it is an accounting problem its an handling the enveloppe problem is that even the higher up accountant which does that and not a stage assistant or something
television,not_removed,dude im brown just making an observation
television,not_removed,no one cares about white people they have enough privilege
television,not_removed,i dont care if youre latino african european asian neanderthal whatever doesnt matter your argument wasnt clearly true in fact id argue it was false all the poc nominees were deserved and the increase probably has more to do with more oscarworthy films about pocs than pandering
television,not_removed,probably not much since she just won a fucking oscar
television,not_removed,
television,not_removed,good catch that makes sense
television,not_removed,i dont think kimmel or beatty knew what was going on either
television,not_removed,hes a partner at pwc so yea hes a higher up handing out the envelopes at the oscars is a glamour gig that the partners would want for themselves they get to take selfies with celebs right after they win oscars he just got distracted in the moment while taking a pic with emma stone
television,not_removed,last year was a weak year for stories by and featuring people of colour and it was only made worse by the fact that the few movies that were worthy of nominations beasts of no nation and selma in particular for one reason or another got snubbed objectively neither was due to race selma screeners went out too late and beasts was snubbed because they dont want to reward netflix but it shined a light on a legitimate issue in hollywood that the academy was run like an old boys club that people werent getting the right opportunities and they needed to open their doors to different voices this year coincidentally or not was a super strong year for films from poc denzel had a drama and everyone loves denzel viola davis was a lock to win her category from pretty much day one and it had nothing to do with the colour of her skin hidden figures probably isnt best picture winner material but it told an important story and moonlight is a super strong film not only because of an all black cast or whatever but because it tells an important modern story every win every nomination for poc were deserved this year whether or not it had anything to do with oscars so white is debatable
television,not_removed,incorrect
television,not_removed,i meant in regards to the situation she was in not her personal achievements
television,not_removed,beatty knew he just didnt know how to fix it
television,not_removed,why am i incorrect
television,not_removed,the situation was she just won an oscar i really doubt her feet had landed by the time the best picture debacle happened
television,not_removed,so youre saying she didnt know what she was saying or what
television,not_removed,she was somewhere else is what im saying
television,not_removed,this dude has a tiger hes my new favorite sorry michonne
television,not_removed,everytime i see ezekiel i keep thinking of dave fennoy and lee everett damn it
television,not_removed,should we abort no we only have two more blinky boxes to go methinks castle was making fun of the trope i mean
television,not_removed,seinfeld friends are two perfect examples in my opinion
television,not_removed,ncis is a great example because this is what cbs does and theyre very good at it big bang theory had about million during the first season and by season hit millionepisode and even their reruns top the charts on tbs over the weekends edit theyre good at it when ratings are measured with the antiquated nielsen system and when you consider your television shows as filler between advertisements
television,not_removed,greys anatomy is still a ratings powerhouse for abc after seasons
television,not_removed,the walking dead has remained very steady in terms of viewers
television,not_removed,game of thrones comes to mind infact i think it is steadily rising perhaps walking dead fits too
television,not_removed,seinfeld i can rewatch every episode indefinitely and breaking bad possibly the best tv show ever made
television,not_removed,id say probably everybody loves raymond and home improvement
television,not_removed,andy griffith star trek the sopranos the simpsons seinfeld im thinking american tv shows that are influential on an international level edited to add monty python dr who upstairs downstairs for public television viewers
television,not_removed,gunsmoke
television,not_removed,law and order house
television,not_removed,i love lucy
television,not_removed,oh my god the finale of seinfeld had a viewership of million which was over one fourth of the american population at the time
television,not_removed,ive heard many people say this and i dont disagree or agree but why is it inaccurate andor antiquated
television,not_removed,you are right season of got started with a mere million viewers on average season rose to million season to million to about million ha that stayed stagnant for season and season is million
television,not_removed,to put that in perspective the final episode of mash drew million total viewers out of a population of million percent of the entire country
television,not_removed,basically they randomly choose homes in the us and the ones who participate are nielsen families and their television habits are monitored theres a fun roseanne episode where they become a nielsen family and they get paranoid about how theyre being viewed so they only watch pbs until they crack anyway so theres a small random percent of people watching stuff for whatever reason maybe they love ncis reruns or they fall asleep with the tv on then nielsen relies heavily on collected data from specific months of the year feb may july and november aka sweeps when the networks make damn sure characters get marriedhave babiesdieetc to guarantee a ratings boost during this critical time anyway my point is theyre relying on randomized crosssections of the population as well as inaccurate methods and time periods of measurement it fosters the big tv network structure and basically shrugs off online viewing as a passing fad
television,not_removed,i have to watch mash some day
television,not_removed,this is excellent
television,not_removed,id want noah hawley to be showrunner under bad robots production and marketing team
television,not_removed,warren ellis
television,not_removed,for one of the writers i would get m night writing twilight zone episodes is what he does
television,not_removed,if you are going to get this right a writers room with noah hawley drew goddard rashida jones jordan peele charlie booker nahnatchka khan the duff brothers and sam esmail directed by tarsem singn james wong angela basset michael goi owen harris joe wright ryan murphy as well as those from the writers room group produced by anonymous content and on usa or fxx
television,not_removed,showrunners noah hawley legion and fargo bryan fuller hannibal etc director cary fukunaga episodes of true detective season lot of talent from penny dreadful and taboo
television,not_removed,please let harlan ellison write at least one more episode before he dies paladin of the lost hour left me in tears does anyone know where i can find dvds or streaming of the version of the zone
television,not_removed,id basically make it a whos who in genre television kinda like how masters of horror or fear itself was have different directors and writers with each episode to add their unique twist and flavor to it and i imagine something like that can attract some big names directors for various episodes fede alvarez mike flanagan jeremy saulnier jonathan nolan dan trachenberg jj abrams james franco greg nicotero writers jonathan nolan and lisa joy frank darabont jed whedon and maurissa tancharoen noah hawley carlton cuse simon pegg drew goddard actors could be anyone but id wanna see patrick wilson elizabeth olsen daniel wu matthew mcconaughey tessa thompson adrien brody hoon lee jeffrey donovan alexandra daddario andrew lincoln angela bassett bryan cranston mads mikkelsen jordan peele and keegan michael key
television,not_removed,i could see bill hader being a decent rod serling hes a pretty versatile actor
television,not_removed,why not make it like a test bed for scifi pet projects and invite different big name writers to create their own episodes
television,not_removed,pen densham is still alive might as well get brad wright too both worked on outer limits maybe a bryan singer episode or two but not three
television,not_removed,cary fukunaga
television,not_removed,mick garris and john carpenter
television,not_removed,id be curious about using a rotating host a star with the right feel for each individual episode but someone you can only afford for a cameo imagine a starker more solemn drama episode introduced and concluded by viola davis with a rock and roll horror tale the next week hosted by jack black
television,not_removed,i would get the crew who do american horror story
television,not_removed,this might be insane but for at least one actor i would use me i know insane but im just that good
television,not_removed,fancasting mel gibson is always at the top for directorbut jordan peele has impressed everyone with get out i favor a mix of females mariska hargatay anna kendrick emily blunt since anna is in bring on chris pratt william shatner definitely gets a cameo if not the whole show bring in bruce campbell i always thought jeff fahey was a great villain for the writing joss whedon on two napkins development by r l stein actually thats the pilot
television,not_removed,actresses gillian anderson vera farmiga eva green
television,not_removed,joss whedon and whomever else he chooses to bring in and maybe neil gaiman for good measure
television,not_removed,whoever is responsible for black mirror
television,not_removed,ryan murphy maybe
television,not_removed,with what hes doing with legion he could easily make a horror show work twilight zone is the perfect mix of horror and satire that i agree that he would be perfect at the helm
television,not_removed,ive never thought about it but perhaps his writing would be better suited for a minute show
television,not_removed,
television,not_removed,what does anna kendrick have to do with chris pratt are you thinking of his wife anna farris or am i missing something
television,not_removed,oh i was wrong like normal
television,not_removed,i always watch the credits every episode i dont understand how people can skip them unless they really hate the song the credits just always put me in the mood to watch the episode even if im on hour of a binge
television,not_removed,it depends on the opening credits if its like a netflix show opening credits house of cards oitnb i tend to skip it after watching some amount of episodes something like friendsamerican dad i watch them because the song is catchy and the credits changes from time
television,not_removed,it really depends on the show and how deeply im into the series ill watch every opening credits to shows with really catchy music or visual imagery if im binge watching a show ill sometimes skip past it to get right to the story
television,not_removed,depends on what format im viewing in for how easy or hard it may be to skip the credits if its easy then i will if its funky then ive learned my lesson with the fact that it just ends up taking longer and being more troublesome to try to skip then to just deal with them
television,not_removed,i watch them all the time binge watch single episodes i think it helps set the mood for the show and i like to look for potential easter eggs within the intro
television,not_removed,only monty python
television,not_removed,i only really watch the openingending credits for a show once the only time that changes is if the openingending changes
television,not_removed,i skip unless they are unique every episode like the simpsons or fringe i watch too much tv and any truncating helps for years i have wished for a netflix binge mode that cuts out opening titles and credits if that existed i would want some options like listing if the opening or credits vary per episode and playing variants once like when the opening is updated each season
television,not_removed,i watch most of them there are a few shows that go really generic and in the past here in the uk we would often get generic versions of the us versions themes as the music was only licensed for the us and deserve to be skipped but if a show makes an effort to craft proper credits its part of the shows identity and should be watched
television,not_removed,depends on how long it is if its longer than seconds i will skip it after seeing it once or twice if its not i will probably just let it play unless i hate the song
television,not_removed,depends on the show if its mad men then yes as they get me in the mood
television,not_removed,it varies stranger things i really dug the opening theme and it was only like episodes the wackness same thing very short but if im watching the office for the play through i fast forward if i have it in the foreground usually i have it on while playing minecraft though so yeah i have to listen to it
television,not_removed,i do too but im kind of a credit junkie i watch all the beginning and ending credits i can trace the origin of this addiction to an experience i had in my early my cousin was working at paramount and invited me to go along with her to a special screening of a movie as the movie ended at the time where in most theaters everyone gets up to leave no one budged then as the credits began to roll there was sporadic applause throughout the theater admittedly i was kind of dumb but only then i realized that just about everyone in the audience were people who had actually worked on the movie and when their name showed up on screen they and their teams applauded this continued on until the very last credit it actually gave me a newfound appreciation for all the people who work really hard to produce our entertainment and since then i watch just about every tv shows and movies full credits
television,not_removed,theres a shitton of tv on and a lot of credits are way over minutes ill watch them occasionally like if im binging then at least once or twice a season but i get the gist and i know the song like the dexter theme is great but its fucking two minutes long i have shit to do
television,not_removed,for years i have wished for a netflix binge mode that cuts out opening titles and credits the netflix app on the does exactly this when bingeing
television,not_removed,ive noticed that netflix will step the credits if you let it automatically go to the next episode and the credits are at the very beginning of the show
television,not_removed,oh yeah i forgot it kind of does this but i would like to be able to control it more
television,not_removed,the resources required to add this feature would probably be way too much to be worth it
television,not_removed,probably i have no expectation it will ever happen but given enough time who knows
television,not_removed,seeing as its a fox property and the heaven logo in the corner looks a heck of a lot like the old x men cartoon logo my guess would be have you seen anything cool
television,not_removed,its the new xmen tv series for fox gifted
television,not_removed,wait til they start shooting and find out the name of the show from a bored extra or truck driver teamster most times between shoots people will get bored and you can ask questions i have been an extra on multiple television shows and movies also look for parking logos and direction signs to set they may say as well also if you have time to be an extra call up your local talent agency they might have extra casting available
television,not_removed,before making legion fox wanted to make a hellfire club adaption dont know much about that comic but this could be it
television,not_removed,see if you see amy acker
television,not_removed,picture from the set or its not happend
television,not_removed,its a marvel show base on the parents of mutants and it involves the mutant registration act someone i know work at fox told me about it
television,not_removed,would have been nice if whomever recently shot at the abandoned hawthorne mall had followed protocol put up notices there was sustained machine gun fire for about takes and then a pair of explosions
television,not_removed,im not sure theyve even decided the name of the show yet the name gifted has been floated but that may not be official either whatever its called though the pilots definitely filming in dallas
television,not_removed,whenever people ask i just say its a cornflakes commercial
television,not_removed,the notice says heaven
television,not_removed,cool thanks for the information i dont understand why i am getting downvoted i gave good information and that is exactly how i got to be a payed extra for the most recent jason bourne movie i talked to a pa on the set and he told me which talent agency to go through and i got payed to be an extra and briefly met matt damon
television,not_removed,and blue harvest was the working title for the production of return of the jedi this likely not the show actual title
television,not_removed,rundown of the plot i just saw it while going through the guide
television,not_removed,watched all the episodes i like it its filling this orphan black hiatus void not sure where they can go from the third episode but ill be watching for sure
television,not_removed,episode is really slow but good it gives her good reasons to make the decision she makes at the end of the episode which will keep the show going seems to be a fun show
television,not_removed,well at least theyre casting black guys now
television,not_removed,fallon isnt a good interviewer love the roots and he does have some good bits
television,not_removed,naw i hate fallon even more than i love brooks
television,not_removed,when is the whole cast of stranger things going to be on the show this week
television,not_removed,my samsung tvs have it but it only supports the pip source being the tuner so that limits its usefulness
television,not_removed,i miss it as well i used to love pip when i watched football i could have my main game and switch to another during commercials
television,not_removed,oh the irony
television,not_removed,if you had a defensible position this is no way to present it and if you think portlandia is diametrically opposed to your values how do you differentiate it from say fox news or social conservative programming but thats the way it is for some on the left theyll attack their friends because theyre too cowardly to attack the real enemy
television,not_removed,oh my word to be honest sometimes i think its a pissing contest to see who can decide to be the most offended
television,not_removed,razor ramon in the flesh﻿
television,not_removed,i need extreme chemotherapy after watching this video﻿
television,not_removed,so many people myself included just think of scientology as some ridiculous joke religion its pretty unsettling to hear the real stories about what goes on behind the scenes and even more so that something like this was ever given religious status considering that you have to pay to join and to advance im pretty proud of ae for being brave enough to take on this fraudulent church by actually airing this show not to mention everyone speaking out against them given the churches reputation for suing
television,not_removed,i wasnt a huge fan of her more like i had no opinion of her before her ama now i wanna support her and this show
television,not_removed,have to admit i laughed through tears at you bastards i know i cant say bastards
television,not_removed,did anyone get the sensodyne commercial right after one of the interviews that almost seemed like it was part of the show it threw me off for a second
television,not_removed,im really liking her approach in this special i said a couple days ago in the other thread that i couldnt imagine her sharing information that she hasnt already shared which is true but now shes really pushing on the broken family aspect if it all it really shows how trapped people become quite frankly scientologists are not the only ones quick to dismiss family members for breaking away and i personally believe a documentary like this could be done on any religion on some level another good piece of work by leah may she continue to succeed in spreading awareness and please bring its all relative back to tv edit just realized its a series looking forward to future episodes
television,not_removed,stream anyone
television,not_removed,one week ago i hardly knew this woman this morning i woke up a little like a crack addict to see where i could find to watch this ive recommended it to a ton of people who would like me have no interest otherwise way to go scientology lawyers
television,not_removed,sweet scientology downvotes coolest thing to happen to me on reddit so far 😂 give me your tears next
television,not_removed,i thought it was a great hour of television my only fear is that the broken families approach might get repetitive and cause most people to lose interest hopefully they have different ways of keeping things engaging throughout the whole series so that the viewership doesnt fall off unless theyre saving katie holmes for the finale
television,not_removed,i dont know if i could be ok with the head of the religion kicking my ass
television,not_removed,anybody got any clue how i can watch this in the uk
television,not_removed,really need to do something about that cult
television,not_removed,the amount of commercials is blowing my mind is this normal minutes of the show minutes of commercials jeez good though
television,not_removed,these people seem pretty normal for the most part but then this amy lady goes telling her story and oh boy
television,not_removed,i thought it was a really good show and i love hearing these peoples stories i will say if anyone hasnt seen going clear before this they really should it helps explain the history and doctrine of the chuch which makes the whole thing make a little more since in my opinion i dont say this to take anythig away from what they are doing in the show i just think it provides some much needed back story
television,not_removed,is there anything new in this about scientology that people dont already know from documentaries or reading about it online
television,not_removed,shes a brave woman knowing the cos will be out to discredit her and damage her career personal life and if her family are still in the church she may never see them again
television,not_removed,heres the web site that the church put up in response to this show httpwwwleahreminiaftermathcom
television,not_removed,i want leahs purple blouse that ties in that cute bow
television,not_removed,while much more pedestrian and inelegant than other scientology exposes ive seen this one might be the most affective its editing and presentation feel very cabletvish but it does seem like a genuine reckoning from leah remini raw emotionality
television,not_removed,
television,not_removed,im not sure if anyone in the top tiers of scientology realizes this but money isnt power lies can never manifest a vision and whats done in the dark always comes to the light
television,not_removed,xenu on the menu
television,not_removed,pretty decent so far i imagine ill watch the rest of the series when it comes out
television,not_removed,kinda corny but worth a watch if you can skip the commercials
television,not_removed,what if anything do you believe at this point
television,not_removed,watching the show ghost adventures in the have a guy wayback who talks about lron hubbard practicing occult rituals calling himself satan also lron hubbard son did an interview with penthouse going to read that next
television,not_removed,i want leahs white with navy blue star blouse also maybe calm down on the botox
television,not_removed,has leah had a stroke or something i dont recall her ever having that slight speech impediment that im seeinghearing during the show also i kinda looks like the left side of her upper lip is drooping slightly ive only ever heard of that being related to those thatve had strokes or nerve damage
television,not_removed,perhaps the fact there were no serious repercussions to hbo for going clear has emboldened other media i just wish the government was bold enough to revoke cos tax exempt status
television,not_removed,its interestingunsettling if you look into how they got their religious status from the irs from the time its tax exemption was removed by the irs in to the reinstatement of the tax exemption in scientologists filed approximately lawsuits against the irs over fifty lawsuits were still active against the irs in although these were settled after the church negotiated a tax exemption with the government another crazy thing to look into is operation snow white the church of scientology is honestly bordering a caricature of some global villainous organization in a james bond movie
television,not_removed,i agree this is not a religion not in the sense that most people consider a church this is a book of fiction that was used by mixing it with good ethics and morals for new comers to brainwashsteal and deceive innocent people for pure greed
television,not_removed,i didnt like her character in king of queens and didnt know anything about her otherwise so i had an indifferentborderingondistaste opinion of her but seeing how brave she is and how passionately she is trying to help and how smart she was to write the autobiography so they couldnt blackmail her i have to say im very impressed
television,not_removed,yeah i didnt know anything about her before her ama but her answers were so thoughtful succinct it definitely made me more curious about her doc
television,not_removed,she had a reality show on ae for a couple seasons i got sucked into it last summer cause i caught a marathon of it while i was on a united flight that had directv
television,not_removed,i cried too i felt so bad for them i didnt realize scientology was so big i looked to see if there was a church in my town and sure enough there is not only that but it says this very city is where l ron hubbard discovered the existence of the thetan spirit and where scientology ultimately began seems like a pretty big deal but somehow the church wasnt built till and i dont know many people who know it exists it creeps me out thinking people in my town could be experiencing these things
television,not_removed,it really is fucking nuts going clear did a great job of breaking it down and explaining the draw
television,not_removed,how do they not realize they may be in a cult while wearing those ridiculous pseudonavy uniforms
television,not_removed,a crazy boy scout troopthat signs a billion year contract
television,not_removed,yesss i was wondering why the church was stopping her from drinking icy water
television,not_removed,we chuckled at that ad buy l rons teeth are so disgusting he could def have used some sensodyne
television,not_removed,if you havent already you should see what happens in rexmormon
television,not_removed,i tried watching it on aes site but it was acting really weird kept trying to load ads but wouldnt play
television,not_removed,youve never seen king of queens
television,not_removed,you have probably seen her in a ton of shit she was in a bunch of tv shows starting as the daughter of the mail man on cheers she was in saved by the bell briefly she stared alongside kevin james in king of queens and she was in a shit ton of tv shows she was also vince vaughns wife in old school she also hasnt aged since the
television,not_removed,the havent even gotten to the sexual psychological and physical abuses i think they started with amy scobee and mike rinder to give background about the upper workings of the church and to give credibility about the horrible human rights abuses that are going to be depicted
television,not_removed,i was thinking along the same lines of it losing its luster relatively quickly with this format i wasnt even thinking about the potential for major exscientologists to be on later episodes or potentially even a scientology response
television,not_removed,some priests have done more then just kick some ass
television,not_removed,well theres a pirate way in doing things
television,not_removed,check out r megalinks
television,not_removed,this
television,not_removed,agreed really enjoyed the half hour special
television,not_removed,back in the i tried watching something on ae and was astounded by the number of commercials i called it the advertisements and endorsements channel and ive been reluctant to watch it ever since
television,not_removed,i think she said in her ama that she wanted to focus on the stories of the people more so than the documentaries have which is why she went for a series
television,not_removed,people still treat you like a conspiracy nut when you mention they kidnap people
television,not_removed,the focus of the series seems to be directed on the shit that happened to people before and after they got out looks to have more personal testimonials and interviews than any other scientology show ive seen
television,not_removed,her family thankfully left with her her fear of not seeing them again kept her in the cult longer than she wanted
television,not_removed,i love how they picked out keywords from the articles for their quotes to paint the show in a negative light they literally picked the only complaints from otherwise positive reviews plus that website looks like it was slapped together in minutes makes me want to watch every second of the series
television,not_removed,its funny that they made a twitter account just for her if you look at the followers all their accounts follow each other
television,not_removed,she is pissed my mind is still adjusting to her being seriously angry and not sitcomangry though if jerry stiller would tell them all to fuck off that would be legendary
television,not_removed,baloney baptists do not institutionally kidnap and rape children
television,not_removed,this is a pretty stupid platitude money is absolute power in our society lies elect members of congress many people ignore the light see anyone catholic who still supports the church who has for decades hidden and moved around child molesters sorry man but the world sucks and platitudes are worthless
television,not_removed,id like to be part of your universe where money doesnt equal power
television,not_removed,yeah none of that is true
television,not_removed,the republicans are about to learn this lesson as well
television,not_removed,doesnt rhyme
television,not_removed,ouch that is what we were saying too uptoke for samies
television,not_removed,botox
television,not_removed,instead of blindly downvoting an honest question maybe someone in the know could just offer a normal comment
television,not_removed,hbo hired like over lawyers to look over going clear and how it can be sued from multiple perspective
television,not_removed,right i searched for a location and sure enough right next to my office building in dallas you gotta read these damn google reviews too httpsimgurcomgallerymwnbn
television,not_removed,or playing musical chairs in a secluded desert camp
television,not_removed,ha i was playing a game and listening to it and thought the same thing

television,not_removed,i had this problem on nbc website for me the problem was firefox i had to use internet explorer
television,not_removed,or the saved by the bell summer season
television,not_removed,she was carlas daughter not cliffs
television,not_removed,are there really any other major former scientologists i didnt think katie holmes had even gone through an actual conversion as a catholic i can say that they would need some really powerful juju to break through the defenses that the holy ghost puts up
television,not_removed,
television,not_removed,well theres a pirate way in doing things
television,not_removed,its kind of par for an ae show that and a lot of rehashes
television,not_removed,wow that shit is high school level trash talk i mean they literally second hand quote someone calling amy scobee such a fake they are clueless to how immature they sound
television,not_removed,thanks
television,not_removed,she said things in her ama
television,not_removed,nah dawg definition of affective relating to arising from or influencing feelings or emotions httpsblogudemycomaffectivevseffective i could have said the show was effective at being affective but i didnt

television,not_removed,plastic surgery andor botox
television,not_removed,i work with the legal team in my very large company they will never agree to be first to do something because of the unknown risk level once a precedent has been set they can realistically determine the risk level and implement sufficient risk mitigation measures eg the disclaimers you see on the show and perhaps even the link to their correspondence with cos are cya also cos is less litigious these days because court cases open them up to public filings during discovery thats how their secret ot teachings were revealed you can see them now in hubbards own handwriting on carnegie mellon they have a lot of interesting references httpwwwcscmuedudstsecrets

television,not_removed,you guys need a dvr
television,not_removed,last time on the gift shop sketch im looking for a gift for my aunt
television,not_removed,how they got so much power especially tax exemption is just plain idiotic no actually their plan was quite genius they sued and tied up the courts by sueing each individual employee of the irs personally and had thousands of people do it costing them millions and wasting the time so they brokered a deal and got tax exempt status if they would drop the thousands of suits
television,not_removed,i think the repetitious stories are necessary though it gives it some sort of horror story feel nd i think compounds the empathy people might be able to feel
television,not_removed,fill me in was her ama bullshit
television,not_removed,but does being more affective make it more effective than other exposes
television,not_removed,would you mind if i asked what exactly about the editing you didnt like was
television,not_removed,its not an institutionalized church thing also youre making this up
television,not_removed,purple monkey dishwasher
television,not_removed,it isnt like jd rockefeller had a giant hammer made out of all his gold to smash anyone who didnt respect him possession is as much a social construct as it always was
television,not_removed,it does if you pronounce it the right way
television,not_removed,i cant
television,not_removed,vanity fair article about her
television,not_removed,no actually their plan was quite evil ftfy they are like dr evils empire from austin powers just less funny and more well evil
television,not_removed,not at all she answered tons of questions and seemed frank about it one question asked how much money she gave scientology she said it was millions she even replied to one person who had received a ton of downvotes they asked how are you going to apologize to lord xenu for your sins and slandering his good name and i believe her response was rather wise im glad you made your joke however that is the type of thing that scientologists will see that will push them back in trivializing their beliefs only makes more dedicated scientologists by reinforcing what lrh says about the critics and not staying focused on its abusive practices
television,not_removed,one of the best amas i ever read
television,not_removed,i saw lots and lots of questions and no answers
television,not_removed,yeah sure for the most part the actual editing is fine its the overall ae style that i take issue with which the editing executed successfully ill talk about the first minute or two in detail so the program starts off with a confessional from leah which is fine but right off the bat there is some aeness going on she relays a statement from the church calling the show a cheap reality tv show and then immediately deadpans the camera with a atmospheric swell in the background and an impact transition this is something used in all the popular unscripted series right now chrissly duckd kard i guess they thought that would be funny or a lampshade or worse good but i thought it was a tacky way to start the show closing with an awkward fade we have the next scene which is another confessional at a different location two confessionals back to back usually doesnt work and this one is much more serious and was probably the original opening to the show as it is much more searing and effectual its almost if they had an alternate opening on the timeline and forgot to rem the weaker one i know thats not what happened but its better thought than someone actually choosing to open the show this way when you have the best possible opening already there maybe they wanted to have a statement by the church to open the show i dont want to be here all night but just look at the they use sometimes tv static chaos most serious documentaries would use hard cuts while much more clinical imagine a ken burns program and the occasional fade animated transitions usually come off gimmicky implying the content of the program isnt engaging enough on its own which i dont thing this program need at all now that i think about it it feels like one of charlie brookers wipe shows which is very satirical and selfaware this topic is too serious for that attempted treatment some of the text dumps werent long enough at there is a full page of text which is cut just a second or two short it was probably fine before a fade got added to the end of it this is very much aes style so i mean what can you expect this may all be on purpose theres a bunch of other small nitpicky stuff but it was enough for me to notice this is what i do not all of it was bad i liked the l ron hubbard montage at just not the transition out of it overall i think leah did a great job constructing the narrative and will be absolutely be watching every week
television,not_removed,shawn bawn seen been
television,not_removed,i can see your rings
television,not_removed,maybe you should go look at it
television,not_removed,good write up thanks for your thoughts

television,not_removed,i told my boys that this is probably the longest wait to a payoff for a joke ive seen on tv
television,not_removed,this is a great scene it reminds me very much of awesome scary and depressing all at the same time
television,not_removed,i was going to make it longer to include that but i didnt want to show too much of the episode
television,not_removed,its probably one of my favorite sketches its up there with marx bros stuff
television,not_removed,it honestly did make me sad though especially morty suffering from the effects of it for the rest of the episode
television,not_removed,rick and morty is one of the best shows on tv right now because it has so much going on its dark its lighthearted its gorey and violent it makes you cry then laugh this show has impressed me beyond reason and now that athf is gone i need a void filled
television,not_removed,ive said before rick and morty is the suboxone to the heroin that was futurama
television,not_removed,hahhahahhahaha
television,not_removed,im not seeing nearly enough love for blackadder here the writing and acting is just so good with lines so infinitely quotable name baldrick first name im not sure you must have some idea well it might be sod off what well when i used to play in the gutter i used to say to the other snipes hello my names baldrick and theyd say yes we know sod off baldrick
television,not_removed,fawlty towers without a doubt is the best british tv show of all time an appropriate comparison may be to imagine if of say the best episodes of the simpsons were the only ones to ever air thats what the quality is like in addition to the ones you have mentioned there are also shows like yes ministeryes prime minister brideshead revisited dads army the original run of absolutely fabulous which were very very good too
television,not_removed,really monty python well spaced is a good argument
television,not_removed,the it crowd
television,not_removed,spaced
television,not_removed,red dwarf
television,not_removed,utopia great writing acting and probably the best cinematography of any british show ever
television,not_removed,coupling basically the british version of friends and one of the funniest shows of all time examples
television,not_removed,only fools and horses
television,not_removed,nobody has mentioned black books yet coupling gets a nod too but i wouldnt put it in the upper echelon
television,not_removed,father ted red dwarf brass eye in that order its all about comedy for me
television,not_removed,skins the first two series are my standouts
television,not_removed,black mirror
television,not_removed,it has to be doctor who continuously evolving and changing throughout the times with the sheer potential to do absolutely anything it wants to do
television,not_removed,black mirror utopia and peaky blinders
television,not_removed,only fools and horses peep show and anything with attenborough or bryan cox nature porn
television,not_removed,out of cats

television,not_removed,i just started watching luther on monday and im nearly done fantastic show also misfits the it crowd come to mind
television,not_removed,brass eye father ted and black mirror come to mind when i think of the best ever
television,not_removed,spaced is really good
television,not_removed,i feel like nobody on here has ever heard of gavin and stacey it never gets mentioned
television,not_removed,garth marenghis dark place and man to man with dean learner i wont say they are the best but i got many lols out of them bottom was good back in the day
television,not_removed,bakeoff
television,not_removed,are you being served is awesome and my very first british tv show i watched as a kid best is subjective but its my favorite i do like mr bean and the inbetweeners too though rowan was able to do a lot with comedy that didnt require having to speak very keatonchaplin like
television,not_removed,the mighty boosh
television,not_removed,clarksonmayhammondera top gear deserves to be in the conversation
television,not_removed,match of the day
television,not_removed,probably one of the david attenborough programmes
television,not_removed,last of the summer wine brilliant stuff that i didnt think id appreciate at first
television,not_removed,minder
television,not_removed,for me spaced black books and father ted are the holy trinity pythons dont count they are a league of their own
television,not_removed,jonathan creek its a shame the more recent ones have been kinda shite but up until i think i enjoyed every episode it was like sherlock but before the smartphone had to be featured in every single episode
television,not_removed,spy was pretty funny
television,not_removed,are you being served
television,not_removed,i dont believe it no one ever mentions one foot in the grave by david renwick the same guy who wrote jonathan creek
television,not_removed,i reckon my answer to this question is im alan partridge cant say ive rewatched anything more its one of those thats a little bit too british to cross the pond though torchwood shouldnt even get a fucking look in ive never heard of mad dogs or the five and the inbetweeners is great but nowhere near the best british sitcoms let alone shows
television,not_removed,does a scottish one count still game very rofl revolves around a couple of pensioners who get up to crazy stuff with their friends in a fictional suburb of glasgow
television,not_removed,all of them
television,not_removed,peaky blinders
television,not_removed,pretty sure its downton abby i think they named it that just to trip people up im going to vote for smack the pony because its my fave brit show and i know no one else is going to vote for it
television,not_removed,the goodies was a classic and holds up well today
television,not_removed,a tie between i claudius and monty python
television,not_removed,best is simple though doctor who dont think any british she has its ratings
television,not_removed,snuff box
television,not_removed,those of you who havent seen i claudius are seriously missing out imagine if game of thrones was set in ancient rome and was released a few decades ago the whole thing is up on youtube its got young patrick stewart in a wig john hurt playing caligula and brian blessed with his beard shaved off if it helps
television,not_removed,miranda
television,not_removed,wolf hall if you want historical fiction
television,not_removed,misfits my mad fat diary black mirror in no specific order
television,not_removed,havent watched a lot of them but black mirror is definitely my favorite utopia was amazing too too bad the season didnt really lived up to the hype premiere best episode of the series excluded
television,not_removed,hugh lauries master of disguise and rik mayalls lord flashheart were of the greatest oneoff characters ever created
television,not_removed,blackadder by far i make it a thing to do to watch the entire series every year it still feels fresh each time more recent shows would be green wing and the inbetweeners i liked green wing more than i did scrubs at least as a comedy the inbetweeners was basically the movie superbad as a tv show but probably even funnier out of cats got me in to panel shows which i didnt even know i liked peep show has gotten a lot of love on this sub and rightfully so probably a more obscure show at least outside of the uk is friday night dinner
television,not_removed,
television,not_removed,i watched the whole series of yes ministerprime minister it shocked me that almost every episode was directly relevant to me even though it was made before i was born in a country i never lived in
television,not_removed,i cannot recall half of what i learned in high school calculus but i can recite line for line some of the most obscure python sketches

television,not_removed,had to scroll way too far to find this
television,not_removed,this is definitely the best british show as in its only people from britain that will get it and it is highly comprised of typical british humour
television,not_removed,black books isnt bad but its definitely the weakest of linehans big works
television,not_removed,father ted was awesome every british person has known a mrs doyle brass eye is a good shout too my favourite line some people say alcohol is a drug its not a drug its a drink
television,not_removed,i have to say father ted is by far one of the few comedies that no matter how many times i have seen it i am laughing my balls off
television,not_removed,i remember when the new red dwarf episodes came out a few years ago and i really had my doubts but then the moose scene with rimmer sold me on it
television,not_removed,blackadder
television,not_removed,the national anthem prime minister allegedly put his balls in a decapitated pigs mouth the entire history of you the snapchat glasses that post right to your story in firstperson the waldo moment donald trump i hate charlie brooker

television,not_removed,the bbc are rehashing it now as prequel about a young hyacinth they seem to be rehashing a lot of comedy at the moment almost as if the commissioners were stuck in the backdoor pilots one of comedies that depending on the reception will go into full production of goodnight sweetheart steptoe and sons till do do us part hancocks half hour
television,not_removed,and as much as ashes to ashes wasnt quite as good the finale to it all was so satisfying
television,not_removed,i had no idea jonathan creek was still going in

television,not_removed,father ted is actually british made by hat trick uk for channel four uk and all the interior shots were filmed in hammersmith london
television,not_removed,not british loved the show
television,not_removed,sure but thats comparing it to two fantastic shows and fwiw i enjoyed black books more than the it crowd i work in it so it crowd is my jam but black books is better written and better acted imo
television,not_removed,in fairness thats like saying the dead pigeon sketch isnt very good because its not the best sketch that john cleese was ever in
television,not_removed,in case anyone is interested the other two are and
television,not_removed,definitely in my top i could do a list of about very quickly but thought id restrict to a top would also add it crowd the day today fantasy football league south park family guy top gear men behaving badly celebrity juice adam and joe show peep show hignfy etc etc
television,not_removed,new episode at christmas i think its lost its way a little changing a lot of the things about jc that make it charming but its still entertainingish

television,not_removed,same
television,not_removed,the really good stuff and the eastenders
television,not_removed,huh i only remembered the version where he was the ace pilot
television,not_removed,leg disabled
television,not_removed,also created by and starring irishmen
television,not_removed,really can i ask which country youre from it is well known though that only fools is one of few british shows that americans will find hard to get
television,not_removed,jam that was a good show too
television,not_removed,did you mean dead parrot because it was a dead parrot
television,not_removed,its already out episode aired tonight
television,not_removed,for the love of all that is good you must watch his appearance in season two its his best in my opinion
television,not_removed,only fools and horses has a cult like following in croatia it aired on tv multiple times and the dvds were sold years back in news stands for cheap
television,not_removed,it wasnt dead it was merely resting
television,not_removed,acid
television,not_removed,i honestly dont really like shows movies that have to do with space i honestly dont think its for you
television,not_removed,i do like shows that have to do with space and i think its marvelous if you cant get over the space thing then youre probably not going to like it because its space opera our heroes fly around in space ships except when theyre hanging out on space stations and they deal with other people and events on space ships and space stations theres one pov character and several scenes on earth but those werent in the book the character doesnt show up until the second book and arent all that essential to the main plot line which happens in space big empty space space space space
television,not_removed,hello i dont like pasta what pasta would you recommend
television,not_removed,its cops spies and soldiers in space the depiction of the space hardware is sort of aiming for real the stories build up over time and drama is better than ok some of the characters are a bit one dimensional its pretty good
television,not_removed,it is a very good sci fi show i would recommend it for anyone who likes sci fi
television,not_removed,its the best show on tv behind got period
television,not_removed,i honestly dont really like shows movies that have to do with space id approach this from a different perspective this is a political thriller characters are fleshed out dialogue is grounded well written and mostly mature it just happens to take place in a different environment some people dont like or appreciate science fiction in part because a great number of scifi productions focus too much on fantasy and not on realism shows like star trek fit this description suspension of disbelief is too much for some viewers who cant relate plotlines may have been poorly written or too far over the top with bad dialogue however when scifi is executed well it can be excellent hbo series westworld is a great example of well written and executed science fiction its a slow thriller that builds and builds that just happens to include futuristic technology as a plot device the expanse also fits this description
television,not_removed,i mean its very much to do with space so theres that but i really really enjoyed it i put it on expecting it to be something i got bored of after five minutes and i ended up watching the whole thing in two days good characters solid performances from the actors great set design and a very coherent story told in an interesting fashion
television,not_removed,it is very good it starts kind of slowly i still loved the beginning its full of worldbuilding and pose the basis for the rest but it picks up around episode and then it kind of not stop season notably has been incredible for now yes its a show that pass in spaceother planets but it isnt the focus like in a star trek or stargate its only in the solar system earth is united and the main politic power of the system mars is colonized and is terraforming its surface and the belters are all the people working on the asteroids of the belt and politics wise its quite of a shit show because nobody really likes each other in those account thrust gravity and stuff like parties then stuff happens in the show and well plenty of things doesnt go well but i wont spoil you its like one century into the future so no ftl or thing like that its very realistic tech wise like politics wise if we have a scifi future im way more inclined to believe in that than star trek knowing humanity there is also a very nice hard scifi quality to it they take into that special effects and direction are very good acting and writing too its based on a successful series of book and the authors are producers on the show so its quite truthful to their work with the necessary adaptations for the tv medium in short you should watch it its only episodes for season and for season for now so its not such a big time commitment it is available on amazon prime in us netflix elsewhere in the world for season season is airing on syfy wednesdays at i believe sorry not in us and will be available later on the streaming services may be simultaneous on amazon prime in us also keep in mind the tone changes quite a lot between season and season is way more space epic than season which has a noir storyline which can bore some people i loved it but know some friends which didnt but they pushed to season and now enjoy it a lot
television,not_removed,its an excellent show human relationships are shown because theyre important not because they add drama depictions of travel communication and combat are the most realistic ive seen in a scifi show all the slow talky parts have a purpose for existing and are not mere filler the show has minimal overt exposition and doesnt treat the audience like kindergarteners advanced concepts are merely mentioned or alluded to and treated as a matter of course basically if you want to think about the universe being built in the show then this is for you if youre looking for a quick inandout type show along the lines of supernatural or warehouse then perhaps not
television,not_removed,its great it builds the world properly for once before it kicks into gear and all the action happens its also a space opera a space epic if you for whatever reason dont like shows set in space then you probably wont like it
television,not_removed,its the scifi series ive always been waiting for great worldbuilding and semirealistic science to back it up and make it interesting and by semirealistic i mean much more realistic than any space show ever made by far yes theres space in it but its not a campy type of space its the kind of space where the hard laws of physics apply too much acceleration will kill you theres no gravity when youre not firing your engine and orbital mechanics dictate how and when ships can move about the solar system but what really makes the show imo is how these laws are applied to create a fleshed out world for the different factions to exist in it takes place in the solar system several hundred years in the future we can travel around the solar system well enough but not beyond that people on earth live on earth and have difficulty getting into space because theyre at the bottom of a gravity well people on mars have a dream of turning their barren world into a garden and are driven towards that and people who grow up in space especially the asteroid belt miners are forgotten and oppressed by everyone because the grow up in low gravity conditions their bones never develop to be strong enough to deal with earth gravity but the citizens of the belt are rising up it is a show about a crew of a ship coming together a story about a noir of an old washed up cop out in the asteroid belt and a story about a old small and fierce indian woman on earth playing politics at the highest level i dont know why you dont like space shows but this isnt really like other space shows how did you feel about battlestar galatica
television,not_removed,good
television,not_removed,i love the show but if you dont like shows that have to do with space this probably isnt for you
television,not_removed,it thoroughly enjoyed it in the beginning there are a lot of factions and places which may be a bit confusing similar to the very first episode of game of thrones but then it all falls into place really like the first season
television,not_removed,literally search it and youll see all the praise its been getting on this sub but yeah if space shows arent your thing then dont watch it or watch episode and see if you like it no one needs to convince you to put down minutes of your time and try it out
television,not_removed,yes as others have noted its a slow burn but then there are some epic moments well worth the viewing
television,not_removed,i dont know much about this show other than the fact that it takes place in spacei honestly dont really like shows movies that have to do with space okay id ask why do you not like stories that deal with space do you not like scifi thats about good guys seeking clues that lead to a secret hidden in an abandoned attempt to colonize a planet do you not like action scenes with pewpew laser fire or do you now like a setting thats not grounded in our earthbound life if its one of the first two the expanse isnt that kind of space drama its an attempt to do a realistic depiction of what humanity would be like if we colonized mars and were mining asteroids it asks what kinds of societies would develop on mars and in space what happens when laypeople are conducting repairs on space walks etc its not a show about good guys and bad guys its more of a political drama where some everyday people come across something that ends up being a major political crisis the game of thrones comparisons arent inapt both have similar themes in a setting thats is unlike ours you just have to decide if youd like got if it had a scifi overlay instead of fantasy
television,not_removed,i honestly dont really like shows movies that have to do with space it may not be to your taste but then im not sure what kind of shows and movies youre thinking of if youre imagining doctor who or star trek this is not remotely one of those as someone else below said it has a lot of elements of a political thriller to it yes most of the action takes place in space but its not a campy or pew pew lasers and warp drive type setting rather being much more accurate about physics and the consequences of space travel think the physics of gravity meets the politics of the cuban missile crisis the basic premise is this years from now humans have colonized the solar system earth struggles to support its population of billion people with a basic standard of living while mars has become an independent military superpower whose two goals are maintaining independence from earth and terraforming their planet to support life outside of their domed cities both earth and mars desperately want the resources of the asteroid belt and the outer solar system which are inhabited by the belters people whove lived their entire lives in mining ships and stations the belters are basically the third world of the system treated pretty badly by both earth and mars and the closest thing to a power base they have is the outer planets alliance a loosely organized group thats one part labor union one part irish republican army it would only take one bad day to start the whole thing unraveling and you can just guess how the series starts personally id say give the first three episodes of the first season a chance if those dont engage you you probably wont go for the rest of it
television,not_removed,most other space shows dont really depict realistic space travel ships are just decorations that warp from one point of galaxy to another where adventures happen and crew meet aliens that look like humans with makeup the expanse on the other hand is quite believable vision of humanity colonising the solar system from lowgravity fights via people struggling with access to water and air to common usage of sign language it helps communicating when sound doesnt work everything confirming that it is really space it is real scifi not space opera
television,not_removed,i dont like clowns i like the expanse
television,not_removed,you answered your own question in your question no
television,not_removed,first season was really slow second season started pretty good then got real good then this last episode was pretty amazeballs and gives me a lot of hope for the direction the show is going assuming it doesnt get canceled
television,not_removed,really boring
television,not_removed,the cgi on episode season is one of the best ive seen on a tvshow hands down i was amazed this show just keeps getting better and better
television,not_removed,i went in not expecting much but it blew me away and i loved watching the episodes im sat here waiting patiently for netflix to start airing here in the uk
television,not_removed,why is there a post just like this and three other posts about how its the best show ever every week kind of suspect i dont even know if its actually good anymore or if syfy is just paying everyone to promote it
television,not_removed,if you dont have a season to kill waiting for a reason to give a shit about the characters nah if youre hoping for some transcendent moment free from reservations about what this show is trying to say youll get a few i dunno if ya havent already battlestar gallacticad id just go for that to see if it suits ya that was a show that did have something to say even if its final paragraph left fans atwitter
television,not_removed,its alright the subpar acting and dialogue detracts from the overall quality of the show
television,not_removed,thread
television,not_removed,so what i hear you saying is theres some space to be found correct me if im wrong
television,not_removed,hello i have a gluten intolerance could i have pasta served on a deep pan pizza please oh and a shitload of dinner rolls
television,not_removed,scifi fantasy and yeah the gritty aliensesque future depicted is genuine fantasy at this point any future that imagines humans drifting through space without comprehensive ai assistance is a projection of pastpresent humanity into a fantasy realm considering that scifi used to be a tool for functional progress of the species star trekinspired tech in regular use nowadays and all its an important distinction to make rather than mere pedantry
television,not_removed,some people dont like or appreciate science fiction in part because a great number of scifi productions focus too much on fantasy and not on realism ive definitely met people who dont care what kind of science fiction it is to them primer star wars and black mirror is all the same thing and theres no convincing them otherwise it can be frustrating
television,not_removed,its only episodes for season eps in season agree on most everything else im speaking as someone who hasnt read the books and walked in blind first enough cant be said about the production quality and set design this isnt a cheap show and the finished product looks great season had good pacing some hard cut editing choices were awkward especially leading into the credits overall the episodes were solid the creators did not try to dumb down this show to reach a larger demographic its intuitive and well written the slowest episodes imho were im intentionally not calling these weak episodes as youve highlighted most of season was setup to introduce and flesh out factions characters and motives these episodes are part of a plotline building up to the payoff in which were excellent season has improved all around best advice to anyone considering the show stick with it thomas jane is a bright spot his performance and a few others will grow on you
television,not_removed,agree with this the expanse is my favorite current show and ive been recommending it to everyone i know since im afraid itll be cancelled to the op yes it is absolutely a space show maybe even more so than other scifi shows with similar settings but in case its the more fantasticcampy elements that have turned you off other shows its the realism that makes the show for me the focus is on the political machinations of different factions and because it really does seem like the way technology and exploration might actually progress in a couple hundred years it feels more modern and relatable than other scifi space shows all the little worldbuilding details are fantastic like the patois of people who live in the belt and have developed their own culture or the way family and relationship dynamics have evolved one of the main characters is the child of eight parents who raised him communally and in general society seems to be more tolerant of various lifestyle choices and orientations it really feels like the creators thought carefully about what aspects of life would continue to evolve and what elements of human nature would still be consistent at that point in the future also the books are great currently on and feel very much like a scifi game of thrones to me if youre into that
television,not_removed,the first five episodes are online
television,not_removed,sometimes there are some poor line deliveries and dialogue that doesnt feel authentic the books are even more guilty of this but overall i find the dialogue to be pretty good theres a lot of irony you seem like a trigger happy wack job foreshadowing well that would be spoilers and subtle character revealing bits is there a cure for his condition imbedded in the conversation
television,not_removed,i wasnt keen on thomas janes weary space cop with a heart of gold routine although i havent read the books but that issue seems to have resolved itself cant agree with your comment on the acting and dialogue in general though
television,not_removed,yeah no you are pretty accurate with your analysis space is indeed an integral part of this television show about humanity in space
television,not_removed,everything runs on ai in the expanse they just dont make a big deal of it as its nothing more than a smart phone computer to them you have set up your soap box in an inappropriate location methinks
television,not_removed,lol who the fuck are you to know ai is an absolute reality for humanitys future
television,not_removed,yup its space opera science fiction needs science to drive the fiction otherwise its just fiction
television,not_removed,first enough cant be said about the production quality and set design this isnt a cheap show and the finished product looks great it often does i was especially impressed with some of the cg work but i also think the sets often feel quite a bit smaller and less lived in than theyre intended to its not a big deal and i dont blame them for how they use their budget i would probably spend them on cool as fuck spaceships too just a little thing thats taken me out of it a few times
television,not_removed,every location is an appropriate location if youre a big enough wanker
television,not_removed,i wouldnt say smaller they actually look quite bigger than what its supposed to be in the books an example would be tycho station appartment theyre big while they clearly shouldnt especially for a low commoner like diogo less lived in i agree but maybe they use new types of construction materials that age well
television,not_removed,havent read the books just going by the show they just have that feel now and again the one where you can tell something is supposed to be huge but despite cg matte paintings to extend the sets the illusion still falls apart i think it was especially an issue on ceres obviously rocinante or whatever doesnt suffer from that since those sets arent meant to look expansive
television,not_removed,small is a matter of perspective in space air and living space are commodities look no further than the iss which is a realistic example of how cramped things can be they clearly shouldnt especially for a low commoner like diogo it could have been one of those japanese or chinese overnight hotels targeted to travelling businessmen which are nothing more than rows of capsules imagine diogo and miller sharing a capsule lol
television,not_removed,i think it was especially an issue on ceres the belt in general and ceres in particular doesnt really have big spaces and stuff because thats not practical and cost money earthmars which built the stations dont care about for belters the belters lives a very claustrophobic life always in small spaces with controlled air rare water and such most of them cant even imagine what earth with a true exterior and room to built looks like its also valid for martians btw and in the upcoming episodes there should be a little more development on that where i would agree would be the martian spaceship interior in cqb where i feel like the command room could be bigger but maybe not its big enough for practicality and all the design in the universe are supposed to make function and often minimal function pass before everything else
television,not_removed,found a link httpwwwspinvfxcomworktheexpanse look at those digital set extensions on ceres like in front of that star helix security building thats what i mean and i do not mean to condemn the entirety of what the company spin did here its generally a fine job i get that tv budgets arent going to be like blockbuster movie budgets
television,not_removed,i get what youre saying about the logic of the universe but im talking about how it comes across on screen its hard to explain without screenshots but i know it when i see it
television,not_removed,look at those digital set extensions on ceres like in front of that star helix security building thats what i mean i dont know man i dont see it
television,not_removed,fair enough but i noticed and this video shows that there are actually quite a bit of that stuff i dont know if its the lighting on set the sets themselves or the cgi that makes it noticeable maybe its a combination the video obviously also shows some pretty damn stellar work especially for tv
television,not_removed,i sort of agree the expanse would have benefited so much from more deep space opulence on the visuals with the advances in graphic i am a little bit surprised that tv shows still is lagging so far behind movies and the expanse obviously have the cgi technology to get around the one big challenge of scififantasy shows to mask that it all takes place in a studio to transcend that cramped studio feel i think the issue here is art direction we need to see the ceres space station from the outside we need more takes where you go from interior to exterior and vice versa if the script for example says ceres early colony population million busy harbor with hundreds of ships going in and out every day you should show it imo it had been obvious to hire eric wernquist httpwwwerikwernquistcomwanderersindexhtml to work on the production design he could probably convey the feeling of adventurous exploration in the solar system which mostly remains unresolved in the expanse
television,not_removed,i had more issues with the fight scenes ships and space combat than with interior sets i guess we all see it a bit differently
television,not_removed,you said it better than i could its that cramped studio feel
television,not_removed,whoever wrote that article thinks we care more about their writing then we doabout marvel pure crap
television,not_removed,its also got a series based on from dusk till dawn and its own wrestling show el rey is fucking great think its owned by robert rodriguez
television,not_removed,and lucha underground
television,not_removed,dusk till dawn is ace i know they have lucha what else they got that people watch
television,not_removed,they had one season of a show called httpsenwikipediaorgwikimatadorustvseries a professional soccer player working under cover for the cia to take down international terrorists
television,not_removed,i just watch it for the kungfu flicks the other programming isnt really that great problem with the movies is that the dubbing is somewhat subpar at times and they dont dub all the movies and opt to subtitle them in english instead this really is the only cable network that shows them on a regular basis they also showed godzilla movies last year around christmas as part of a marathon from the first movie to the final wars installment which came out in and was gonna be the last movie until the recent reboot happened another plus is that after its uncensored and you get to see everything the chinese boxer had a rape scene in it as well as a suicide and the whole movie is bleak as hell
television,not_removed,lucha underground and dusk til dawn are solid reasons to have this channel also red v blue on tv is cool
television,not_removed,yeah i just looked it up on wikipedia didnt even realize i liked this kind of programming
television,not_removed,in the movie el rey was the place where the tarantinoclooney characters were going to retire btw its gotta have some sort of special meaning for rr
television,not_removed,thats a great series thought it was going to be really campy and silly but its actually a really good straight up drama
television,not_removed,lucha ill have to check and see if its included in my dish package
television,not_removed,i just know of it from dusk till dawn and lucha underground but the ads i see all look damn good
television,not_removed,lucha underground is a show on el rey and absolutely worth checking out
television,not_removed,do you get them from torrents
television,not_removed,just checked it out and it looks like lucha underground is a fighting show dont want to sound like a pussy or nothing but im a little squeamish about blood do they have cool costumes
television,not_removed,i did at one point yeah but dusk till dawn is on either netflix or hulu now lu is still hard to get
television,not_removed,its a way more cinematic wrestling show than what youre probably expecting im on mobile and have no idea how to link to stuff but look up drago dudes a god damn dragon
television,not_removed,the internet isnt good enough to stream reliably where im at i do use netflix for hard discs every month
television,not_removed,no doubt
television,not_removed,dule deserves better
television,not_removed,psych dude finally gets a gig and its the worst decision he could have made
television,not_removed,yall can dump on katherine heigl but the writing was the problem i hate when shows start with so many wells from which to gather subplots this show was so chock full of subplots that any chance for a cohesive plot was lost in the first episode
television,not_removed,was this show really that bad
television,not_removed,never heard of it but if the show was on hbo and katherine heigl went nude it would still be going
television,not_removed,cmon son
television,not_removed,dule shouldve known not to get on this show after seeing heigls name appear
television,not_removed,the writing was bad and if youre looking for a heartfelt lawyer procedural then look no further than boston legal i do miss dule and dreama walker from new girl shes pretty swell but heigel is definitely tv poison
television,not_removed,isnt this one of the ones they tried to do on their moronic all access shit show
television,not_removed,doubt fired
television,not_removed,katherine heigl doesnt
television,not_removed,since everyone is doing reboots they should make a psych reboot id love to see dule and james roday together again
television,not_removed,you hear about doubt thats messed up right
television,not_removed,you know thats right
television,not_removed,hes on ballers
television,not_removed,shouldve bailed when he saw katherine heigl
television,not_removed,it was more than just the writing the breaks between scenes and the generally rushed feeling of the presentation really hurt it the cliche music for every other scene was annoying the case plots werent up to the grade of other successful legal dramasand then theres the fact it yet another legal drama there is the chance these things got sorted out later in the season but the first episodes were just plain awful
television,not_removed,it has katherine heigl in it so it never even crossed my mind to watch im sure many people thought the same
television,not_removed,true ill admit that i couldnt keep my eyes off her chest whenever she was on screen
television,not_removed,nope
television,not_removed,instead of a reboot get them a singlecamera comedy or a movie deal
television,not_removed,they should do a big usa network crossover show with the guys from psych monk dead zone and burn notice
television,not_removed,they made a horror movie together called gravy it was a great movie i remember googling it after i seen it several months ago that it was planned to be the first of many projects for the two if you are a fan of dule and james def check out the movie gravy
television,not_removed,if were asking for more of a dule hill show the obvious option is west wing
television,not_removed,tch
television,not_removed,and he is perfect in that role he is the most believable nfl coach ive ever seen in a movieshow
television,not_removed,back when she was on that medical show and made it big she asked the production company to hold off filming the new season so she could finish filming her movie then shortly after this she publicly withdrew from an emmy nom because the writing isnt good enough to warrant an award to quote bill murray talking about chevy chase after you become famous you get about months to learn how to not be a dick
television,not_removed,wasnt she on greys anatomy that shows still going
television,not_removed,its ok you will probably get to see the remaining episodes at on saturday this summer if you arent up to anything
television,not_removed,and they all work at evil corp
television,not_removed,isnt he the gm
television,not_removed,hes the gm not the coach and id say hes pretty generic in that limited role
television,not_removed,his character is god awful though not his fault but every line of dialogue sounds like youre coach on mycareer in just the most generic writing ever for his character
television,not_removed,that medical show
television,not_removed,that shows still going years after she left
television,not_removed,so normal
television,not_removed,i didnt really feel like googling her show and i didnt want to guess and get it wrong
television,not_removed,whoops
television,not_removed,house
television,not_removed,mash dr kildare
television,not_removed,the highest rated drama on tv
television,not_removed,currently the highest rated drama on tv is the walking dead and the highest rated drama on broadcast tv is empire
television,not_removed,a selfrighteous mark rant without jez there to counterbalance just seems off to me
television,not_removed,im not sure ive ever felt more fortunate in my life really anything you would have dreams of accomplishing would be nearly impossible how would you write compose or play music engage in conversation draw etc this is just so informative on such a basic level you think schizophrenia makes a person crazy but its real toxicity is that it isolates you it turns every day life into a chore basic human interaction is something people desperately need and it robs you of that im so devastated by this video
television,not_removed,my biggest fear watching these videos is stopping it but the voices just keep going
television,not_removed,i attended a psychiatrypsychology conference years ago one of the pharma exhibitors had several full vr setups they were fullsensory schizophrenia simulators during the minutes or so you experienced a schizophrenic going to a pharmacy to refill his meds as they began wearing off you heard voices taunting you saw figures appear and disappear from your peripheral vision im a long time gamer and i found it very very disturbing
television,not_removed,my fiance is a sufferer of schizophrenia she has been pretty lucky in that she has found the right medications that have allowed her to live a seminormal life she just graduated college and did really well and is applying for jobs what people dont talk about is the cost of the medications we just moved from mn to il and she got in a medicaid program here we never had a problem in mn with her medications in fact they were awesome thousands of dollars of medications covered monthly illinois has the worst medicaid i have ever even heard of since moving here she has switched programs times because all of them outright refuse to cover her antipsychotic they say they will if we provide documentation that she has tried other generics and when we do they say it is not enough and give her a list of other meds to try she has tried different medications before she found the one she is on now and the last time she tried to switch she ended up on an month commitment to a state facility our health system is so broken and its hard to see how much extra stress it puts her under she finally found something that gives her some sense of normalcy but it is so difficult to obtain i have reverted to having her doctor hand write the scripts so i can order the medication from canada where it is the price i pay out of pocket and i always will if i have too sorry for the rant but i see the problem as not being just the disease its the lack of availability of care she cannot take care of herself when she is in an episode and the disease forces her to alienate everyone close to her her family blames her for her illness and doesnt really even talk to her anymore it makes my heart ache to watch people with this illness
television,not_removed,this video is interesting because anderson is explaining how he feels about the voices heres another one shot from first person perspective that is a bit more jarring httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvlwywckfrksg
television,not_removed,and just think anderson knows that the voices are not real big difference﻿
television,not_removed,i use schizophrenia simulator when i work out
television,not_removed,its worth noting that most people would probably handle this far worse than anderson did because as part of his job he spends hours at a time with an earpiece on and people yelling at him to talk about this or that on some level hes used to this and yet even he is having a hard time with the voices here
television,not_removed,we used these during crisis intervention traininghorrifying
television,not_removed,ive never had the balls to watch any of these videos that simulate schizophrenia because i started developing severe anxiety years ago and associated it with going crazy and became obsessive with the idea and fear that i had or would get schizophrenia i would constantly have panic attacks thinking i heard or saw something and was always on alert and testing the world around me to be sure
television,not_removed,this is what it feels like when two different people put on their music in the same room at work
television,not_removed,im going to say words you dont have to remember them do you remember any of the words
television,not_removed,i wonder if it is easier to deal with in other countries according to studies other countries the voices seem to be more benign stanford anthropologist tanya luhrmann found that voicehearing experiences of people with serious psychotic disorders are shaped by local culture – in the united states the voices are harsh and threatening in africa and india they are more benign and playful this may have clinical implications for how to treat people with schizophrenia she suggests
television,not_removed,one of my best friends committed suicide a few years ago due to schizophrenia he was one of the most talented beautiful human being that ive ever had the pleasure of knowing
television,not_removed,holy fuck this is terrifying
television,not_removed,asking the question and being asked the question do you hear voices is a difficult one its difficult to define internal dialogue and hearing voices also the stigma it creates for the affected his horrible real or imagined
television,not_removed,the tonecontent of auditory hallucinations have been shown to vary based on local culture us sufferers are more likely to have harsh and threatening experiences
television,not_removed,just a note that schizophrenic auditory hallucinations tend to be person voices speaking to each other or themselves wheras manicdepressive auditory hallucinations tend to be person voices speaking to you
television,not_removed,as someone with depression and anxiety this is somewhat the same thing just without the audible voices
television,not_removed,and then at the end they turned the simulator on
television,not_removed,i had something similar happen when i was put on too high of a dose of concerta i was constantly having arguments in my head with myself and just mentally being berated it was so loud and i felt fucked up all the time i cant imagine always living like that i was going insane
television,not_removed,literally just watched this in an abnormal psych class this has been one of the most interesting topics of discussion in that class
television,not_removed,wow so i had it on in the background while here at work i couldnt eveen read it was crazy af
television,not_removed,cant do half those tasks as is too many thoughts going on to remember words man that suprised even me
television,not_removed,the ones with ar are even worst httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvatoccteqxca
television,not_removed,im toxic towards myself sometimes am i schizophrenic
television,not_removed,what does it say about me since i am listening to anderson cooper talk about this while listening to the simulator all while getting my job done
television,not_removed,we did this in nursing school during our psych rotation we had to do a scavenger hunt with the headphones on it was pretty hard to focus
television,not_removed,this is something i deal with on a daily basis and while it is hard at times i am able to function some days are worse that others with voices and hallucinations but thatnks to medication i am able to tolerate them and separate reality from hallucination the negative symptoms are worse for me as it is hard to connect with people at times and feelings just arent ther working through daily exercises to better those symptoms make living life a bit easier
television,not_removed,he is lucky he can simply take out the headphones to stop the voices while those who suffer from it cannot
television,not_removed,a few things and some questions that maybe others could comment on has the trend towards chatting greatly improved the lives on those with this problem of course its difficult to remember things and talk with people when you have voices talking to you in the same volume even i found it difficult when she said the word rain that said i can read and write totally fine no matter what voices or noises i hear so long as you dont hallucinate text id think chatting applications would greatly improve the communication skills of people who hear voices this is just my opinion though id also point out that people seem to have no problem ignoring people talking directly to them on a day to day basis i know ive started talking to my friend whos reading a book or chatting or something and felt my words go in one ear and out the other it would seem that concentration on readingwriting would allow for better communication assuming you dont hallucinate words would wearing ear plugs help not in the sense that it stops you from hearing voices but in the sense that you know any voices you hear wouldnt be real do people with schizophrenia hallucinate people saying different things like will someone with schizophrenia see me talking and imagine im saying something different or imagine me being there and talking even though maybe im not there assuming you dont fall into that false reality it seems like it would be a viable way to avoid false noises it would be incredibly annoying to think someone is always talking to you in public because its totally possible people will be talking to you anderson cooper knows that all that stuff isnt real making it easier to block out it seems some people with schizophrenia seem to know the voices arent real but then somehow fall into it being real like that kid with the video on here the other day talking about it casually and what hes hearingseeing but then starts talking about demons anderson cooper or anyone in a simulator doesnt experience that breakdown in reality
television,not_removed,what is that picture in the top left behind him it kinda looks like the bottom of ted cruzs face
television,not_removed,dont sleep for days take a psychedelic and listen to this voices then you get a real understanding what schizophrenia psychosis looks like
television,not_removed,is there someplace the average person can go to try this
television,not_removed,dont blame him just because he fails as a power bottom
television,not_removed,cant wait till subreddit simulator gets a hold of this headline man joins mainstream media finds it impossible to do simple tasks and follow basic ethics guidelines
television,not_removed,i wonder how oftern this gets reposted i saw it about once a week
television,not_removed,schizophrenia simulator through a pair of headphones what
television,not_removed,not that i dont think this is a problem for people but some of those things im a little skeptical about for being a problem for him personally to finish trying to listen to the person talk and answer questions while the voices are going in the headphones makes sense thats an issue for me when im watching a stream of someone playing a game talking and then someone in real life is trying to talk to me at the same time but taking a simple test and doing origami seems like it would be a nonissue youre following written instructions and dont have to listen to anything
television,not_removed,hey i recognize this from when it was posted last week what a coincidence
television,not_removed,anderson cooper should try reporting the news without severe liberal favoritism
television,not_removed,its this guy on crack so many things wrong with this test not to mention hes pandering schizophrenics go through a lot i dunno i find this kind of fake myself i find these types of shows use diseasesdefects and abnormalities as a way to level with soft hearted viewers to make this viewers feel like this entity cares about any of these problems while simultaneously making themselves look good maybe im way off base i dont know
television,not_removed,my voices just keep telling me winning lotto numbers before they come out i just cant enjoy all the money oh and they are really good at trivia games too except for one of them i dont know what hes talking about because i dont speak esperonto
television,not_removed,ive heard andersons done a little bit of blow in his time just my two cents
television,not_removed,i know a guy who struggles with schizophrenia ive met him countless times and he always introduces himself as if it were the first time we met the crazy part is he is a phenominal guitarist its like its the one thing that he can really retain and focus on knowing now that this might be what he goes through on a daily basis im all the more impressed by the beautiful music he is capable of producing
television,not_removed,ive never been diagnosed but definitely get this effect sometimes when my stress is very high even simple things make me concentrate i involuntarily find myself reacting to them internally in attempts to shut them off or distract myself from them its hard it hurts your selfesteem also sometimes you get interesting or okay things out of it like a muse but often it just isolates you and makes you uncomfortable or scared fear comes a lot sometimes my heads totally clear though
television,not_removed,my neighbor is a school teacher and has it she must be heavily medicated when she teaches when shes home she can be completely nut it doesnt help that she has cats in a small condo yes that is no joke i have personally counted that many looking out her window
television,not_removed,really anything you would have dreams of accomplishing would be nearly impossible how would you write compose or play music engage in conversation draw etc maybe you just let the voices do it for you im sure theyd have the same chance at succeeding as you would on your own its not like accomplishing your dreams is something all we normal people are out doing every day anyway
television,not_removed,thats what i was thinking
television,not_removed,mine is i wouldnt beable to pass the verbal tests and sure enough i didnt pass them as easilly as i thought i could name the last presidents but when the women asked what were the words i couldnt list a one though i think that verbal test is missleading because when some one says that i dont have to repeat backremember something it goes in one ear and out the other but you do have to remeber the words
television,not_removed,what voices
television,not_removed,i always thought that when they say voices in the head they meant persistent thoughts people that hear these voices cant tell the difference between a person talking to them and what they are hearing in their head like i had a hard time telling the difference between video feed and skype conversation that i had while the video was playing i asked my skype person if she just said something and had to pause the video as i started to feel uneasy
television,not_removed,youre a good guy keep up the good work
television,not_removed,you are a wonderful person as someone with a mental illness having a partner who has your back can be a complete life changer more than just having someone to take care of you the most impactful part is having someone who believes you hears you and empathizes with you the isolation of everyones disbelief is the hardest part
television,not_removed,of a guy who filmed himself having a schizophrenic episode at one point hes sitting there and thinks his cell phone is ringing when its not later he says i cant believe im even doing this showing people what a dumb fuck i am poor guy has a real problem and is criticizing himself because of it
television,not_removed,i was just thinking that in no freaking way could you get me to do that
television,not_removed,i want to believe
television,not_removed,holy fuck
television,not_removed,if youre being serious please expand because thats interesting
television,not_removed,this year i met a really cool kid whos schizophrenic works his ass off and is smart and motivated as hell i was wondering if you could answer some stuff ive been curious about is there different kinds or levels of intensity that certain people have
television,not_removed,i am starting to suspect that my younger brother has schizophrenia it runs in my family so is entirely plausible and started surfacing around the age of do you have any reading materialsforumsetc that you suggest to help me figure out how to handle this hes incredibley stubborn and proud so it will be nearly impossible to convince him to get help he recently moved across the country to escape legal troubles here and is now ignoring my very loving family
television,not_removed,you can go through psychosis with anxiety too its just a sign that you need medication
television,not_removed,im looking at you debra
television,not_removed,tells you a lot about america doesnt it
television,not_removed,thats what i was just thinking about i dont hear voices as if theyre someone else telling me things but the irrational doubts and thinking that other people must be thinking stuff about me is familiar
television,not_removed,yeah its actively your inner voice and you telling yourself this stuff you cant help or stop the thought but you can somewhat control them at least from my experience
television,not_removed,i was thinking that too this is how i live start to feel panicky and movements may get jerky looking around everywhere chest pain that gets tighter and tighter making it difficult to breathe cant figure out whats distorted perception and whats actually happening everyone is looking at me judging me internal monologue of hateful wordsfrom myself about myself cant get away from it at home i can try to drown it out with music or tv but sometimes its not enough the thoughts creep in and the bashing continues because now ive wasted so much time watching shows havent done anything useful and now out of energy to move things around me deteriorate dishes arent washed food is too hard to make trash piles up cant go outside someone might see me or worse try to talk to me its not worth it every time i hear someone going by outside they must be coming to talk to me theyre probably upset about something i did or some responsibility i didnt fulfill run through all the possibilities in my head make a list of shortcomings old and new paranoia leads to more self criticism why cant you do anything right everyone else is capable of doing these things youre a waste of air and bringing your loved ones down by being a burden on them come a long way medication for depression and anxiety weekly therapy supportive friends makes it all seem much more bearable gets easier to see what things actually do make life worth living it was too hard to see it feel it before just hold on keep breathing
television,not_removed,no its not same thing schizophrenia causes depression and anxiety whilst inflicting all sorts of other conditions amongst a plethora of other horrible emotions you would never be exposed to unless youve had people hunting you with the intent to kill you if schizophrenia manages to catch you off guard you begin to believe absolutely crazy things even if you know they arent true it will not matter how much you trust someone whether they be family or closest friend you will begin to believe they are messing with your head for whatever reason the downward spiral caused by schizophrenia has no comparison and is not easily simulated because the initial stages of realising youre crazy and the emotional impact of having no escape is what causes the condition to essentially feed itself the idea of suicide is comforting especially when you dont believe it will go away and you start to believe that youre broken one of the worst things about it is actually being labeled as a schizophrenic and being deemed a danger to yourself and others around you having those close to you not trust you because others with your condition are capable of horrific acts sorry if i seem a little harsh
television,not_removed,i have depression and anxiety and im glad its not like what this video is describing at least i am still in control of my own mind
television,not_removed,o fug
television,not_removed,we are all schizophrenic on this blessed day
television,not_removed,thanks for clearing that up for everybody
television,not_removed,schizophrenia tends to get worse with time charlie rose has a good segment on it ear plugs dont help the part of the brain that is stimulated when hearing the voices is the same part that processes sound so to yourself it sounds like the voices are real often times the voices dont sound like this at all but instead people attribute them to httpwwwtempleosorg see answers also probably the best answer in this thread so far is
television,not_removed,not sleeping for ages is legit scary one i had a terrible nights sleep i could hear doors slamming and people walking around in the corner of my eyes even sometimes yelling i knew it was cause i was tired so i wasnt scared
television,not_removed,more like a debate hall while sitting between the debaters while they are debating one side of completely different topics at the same time with changing intensities while listening to an audio book of a dr seuss biography and a auctioneer is yelling out numbers in the distance occasionally actually speaking into a microphone that has speakers inside the hall and you have to decide what you feel like eating for breakfast
television,not_removed,mean voices in your head telling you to do bad things
television,not_removed,you have to concentrate the voices are distracting and negative its like someone is over your shoulder telling you that youre stupid and you cant do it not just one person many of them cant tell them to be quiet and let you be for a minute this clip is trying to give you a little insight into an aspect of schizophrenia its like how you said you understood why it was difficult to listen to someone talk while listening to the headphones you have empathy because you have experienced something similar as for the rest its hard to empathize with something you havent experienced for yourself its best to be supportive and patient realizing you cant necessarily fully understand what theyre going through dont need to add to all the other negative voices lol
television,not_removed,awful is like this bad terrible disgusting aweful is like this amazing incredible glorious
television,not_removed,you should try commenting while remaining on topic
television,not_removed,in the context of this video do you mean his demonstrating sympathy to sufferers of schizophrenia yes what terrible liberal lefty pinko communist leanings he has
television,not_removed,a simulation is fake by definition you cant just give schizophrenia you can simulate it though the most effective simulation would involve constant monitoring with a video camera with different people who all randomly say things at random volumes which may or may not have context eventually your subconscious voice dealing with context and deep thought would be no more indistinguishable than the other voices you would also likely need therapy after a week these types of videos will have a net positive outcome on society so i dont know what youre smoking tldr you are so far off base
television,not_removed,youre not just off base youre playing a whole other ball game
television,not_removed,ive heard my two cents it looks like youre constantly in debt because youre always borrowing cents
television,not_removed,i had no idea it used to be a death sentence it that from a high suicide rate i cant imagine going to a doctor to try and solve my symptoms and hearing that im going to kill myself eventually god this is seriously wrecking me if you dont mind me asking how well do your meds work in relation to the severity of your schizophrenia without the meds do you see them being able to cure it eventually is there ongoing research to find more ways to help is there anything a nonsufferer like myself can do to help
television,not_removed,im glad you appreciate his remarkableness i feel it must often be overlooked like a beautiful mind people dont appreciate just how hard it was for nash to show up to class
television,not_removed,its sad that it makes you isolate yourself and because of the stigma around mental illness especially schizophrenia people isolate you too it cuts to the very worst experience of humanity loneliness im sorry you gave up deal with that are there ways to snap out of it as in when you recognize the symptoms starting are you able to find ways of eliminating your stress to get your mind clear again i can imagine its easy to fall into a spiral where the stressinduced symptoms just create more stress
television,not_removed,i started listening to them eventually and it really did start affecting me even though its just generic insults it felt personal i found myself responding to them internally you smell no i dont everyone knows your secrets i dont think so but if they did it would probably be this this and this and then i started thinking about my biggest regrets in life if it was your own voice saying very personal things that prey on your fears i can only imagine how much harder it would be also i was still able to function at work but there were several typos i had to fix and i had to pull up my computers clock three times to actually even read what it said and that was only minute or so cooper did it all day long
television,not_removed,wow okay first you should refrain from using im sure when you are making an assumption about something youve never experienced schizophrenia is an obstacle not an aide and from the audio hallucination examples ive seen the voices arent creative and often theyre very repetitive so not only would they be terrible at writing how would you expect a voice in your head to accomplish any of the other things i mentioned btw most of us are accomplishing our dreams one way or another
television,not_removed,or were you
television,not_removed,yeah but i dont even think most people have the shortterm memory to remember a completely random series of words recall some other completely unrelated sequence of wordseventers and then recall every one of those previous words i think it was an exercise thats just designed to make you feel confused and overwhelmed
television,not_removed,random things like a door bell to most people they wouldnt think twice about a door bell hence my service dog to help sort what is real and what isnt
television,not_removed,there was a sort of recent study that showed that during auditory hallucinations the part of the brain responsible for hearing was very active like they were hearing something
television,not_removed,i cant remember the title but i read one book by a person suffering from schizophrenia and he writes that when he first started hearing the voices he searched for a hidden radio in his room
television,not_removed,she is an amazing person she is the one who took care of me during a time of my life that i didnt think i would make it through she has helped me more than i could ever help her so if i can do anything for her i will i just wish people could see past her mental illness its really quite bizarre because most people say they understand mental illness and are accepting of it but they will immediately alienate her when they find out about what she struggles with people like to pretend to understand but anyone who has actually been around someone who has had an episode or who has an illness like this understands that it is not something you can just be accepting of it has taken me a very very long time of working with a therapist and my father who worked in a behavioral health hospital for quite some time to gain the proper skills to help her instead of harm her when she is in a bad place during the beginning of our relationship i had no idea how scary of a disease it really was and i thought using logic to combat it would work stupid i know but i tried to test that when her mental health declined in our second year together i can tell anyone here that it takes an incredible amount of patience and love and is not easy and i advise you not to take something like this on unless you are prepared to dedicate a lot of time and effort to understand this illness i suggest reading a lot of articles online about how it forces the affected to distrust those closest to them it is a very scary illness and she is very strong for being able to accomplish what she has while dealing with this
television,not_removed,the last one was the most effective
television,not_removed,what does it mean that i find these quite comforting to the point i think i would enjoy sleeping with these playing edit why down vote if you ignore what they are saying many of the phrases are said in a fairly soothing tone im not saying i would enjoy schizophrenia just the recording arent effective at making me feel uncomfortable i was actually wondering if that might have been an early warning sign because my history ticks some of the boxes already
television,not_removed,i saw this some months ago damn it was terrifying to bad he didnt make more of these
television,not_removed,youre lazy and you sleep too much
television,not_removed,you suck and the girl on the treadmill over there knows it pushes harder
television,not_removed,is it much different from listening to musicsongs i noticed i cannot write an english text while a song plays but writing a computer program is not affected by it
television,not_removed,right onyou just cant simulate that lack of awareness that disconnect schizos deal with its just listening to angry voices but we retain conscious awareness of reality not to mention the visuals this does nothing to address that distortion of reality
television,not_removed,yeah i think the fact that its coming from a device not in your own head is the biggest thing that would make it easier if voices are in my head thats my reality and thats a whole lot scarier
television,not_removed,yes there are there are also a constellation of positive and negative symptoms so you could have someone with schizophrenia whose only symptoms are things added to their behaviour like delusions hallucinations then you have negative symptoms where you lose things this could be the ability to talk sensically if could be your emotions and their expression it could be all movement affect and interactivity that leaves you a statue so yes very much so honestly i specifically doubt whether the construct of schizophrenia actually is a discrete category rather than either a spectrum or a catch all diagnosis im not a scientologist i dont think schizophrenia is made up what im not so sure of whether schizophrenia is actually a discrete category really comes down to whether the etiology is the same mechanisms are the same leading to a different outcome possible but a paranoid schizophrenic is a very different thing than a catatonic schizophrenic
television,not_removed,schizophrenia httpswwwnamiorglearnmorementalhealthconditionsschizophrenia
television,not_removed,debra rhymes with zebra
television,not_removed,im glad someone else here isnt just talking out of their ass a lot of self diagnosed people and people with anxiety in here spreading a lot of misinformation
television,not_removed,i think its important to consider that knowledge of the voices being artificial and knowing they can be ended at will makes a world of difference thats what i think the op comment was implying in addition voices coming from within your mind have intimate knowledge of your other thoughts fears and situational context which makes them so much more horrifying imo some schizophrenics even experience voices that have knowledge the sufferer themselves doesnt have conscious awareness of paranoid aspects of schizophrenia can make someone skeptical of medical professionals institutions people in power etc its not easy to get help when you think everyone is out to get you i dont think there is any audio track in the world that can give you a real glimpse into how frightening schizophrenia can be
television,not_removed,schizophrenia is far more than that
television,not_removed,actually aweful isnt a word awful can mean all of those things
television,not_removed,which universe am i in
television,not_removed,ill be the first to admit i thought he was just a strange man who drank too much at first you never really know what someone is dealing with and its unfair to them to jump to conclusions like i did with him
television,not_removed,occasionally i have total control over whats in my head and sometimes i do not theres a kind of threshold beyond which i will remain stressed until it spontaneously lifts i had a girl very recently pretty much kill me emotionally so that adds to it but no generally if its doing that i have to wait sometimes i can create what i learned of as a reverse dialogue and that helps its basically just monitoring opportunities to argue with these ideas and trying to stay selfaware while it sorts itself out and not panicking thanks im pretty introverted and it doesnt help that most people are somewhat unaware of not just that but mental illness information in general im not that bad off not as bad as people who barely function im in college and doing okay
television,not_removed,im sure is more a figure of speech that ironically means i think more than i know im sure people realize that btw most of us are accomplishing our dreams one way or another you must have shitty dreams then
television,not_removed,everyone hears a voice though right
television,not_removed,i hear distant voices when my neighbor leaves his tv on too loud sometimes i can make out what show or commercial is on
television,not_removed,smart use of a service dog i ask my fiance whenever i think theres something weird you hear that hear what shit hardest part for me is knowing if what i might have seen or heard was a hallucination or an artifact usually anytime i ask that question to myself i judge it as an artifact
television,not_removed,i would imagine you get to a point where no matter how unlikely the solution once you have ruled out the likely it is all that remains
television,not_removed,no there is nothing going on with you there is a big difference between listening to a recording willingly that you know you can turn off and actually experiencing auditory hallucinations youre not special
television,not_removed,the cnn video is exercises in empathy so according to cnn youre a psychopath unable to experience others emotions i just think cnn is being a dick
television,not_removed,dont cut yourself on your edge
television,not_removed,its okay youre okay all is well calm down shut up
television,not_removed,did you skip leg day cause youre looking a little top heavy pushes sadly
television,not_removed,same i have recently gotten in the habit of trying to assuage the guilt of recognizing to feel that way is a type of vanity it helps me remember logically the likelihood of those things being true is very very low and even if they did i laugh at myself enough i dont screw other people i mind my own business and i like to think im likeable so it passes more often now than it lingers but i have spent a good deal of time dealing with it
television,not_removed,well go see a doctor dummy but seriously i myself have issues with anxiety and it sounds like you could very well have an extreme panic and anxiety disorder as well mine generally gets bad if im far away from home in an unfamiliar place and usually manifests as me having to pee even when i did minutes ago or havent drank anything all day it feels real as you said my face gets hot and my brain races and for me relief is going into a bathroom and having a minute and telling myself ok i dont have to pee now then its a coin toss as to what i feel when i go outside schizophrenia is even worse anxiety is bad it ruined a good portion of my life however what they go through seems to be a constant its always noise to the point where my friend has to keep talking to drown it out he says he walks with his backs against a wall at home because theres always a fear that someone is going to stab him one day after it rained and it was sunny out some water fell off a door and he had to leave because it shocked him he had to rush home on his bike to hug his dog also the mirade of things he sees as real that arent definitely get a doctors opinion though i only have my experiences and his to judge by hope for anxiety and panic disorders read through ranxiety and see if you relate more to them
television,not_removed,you know nothing and need to go see a doctor if you really do think you are schizophrenic as someone who has struggled with mental illness for the better part of years i really hate it when i see people like you particularly that first sentence personally you sound like you have self esteem issues
television,not_removed,no problem worth a shot hes a great kid has potential to do better than most normal adults if he has the right support system
television,not_removed,thank you for the kind words this week has been a whirlwind so i havent had the time to get back to you my father actually flew across the country to go get my brother who had been homeless for the past days after getting paranoid and ditched his friends and they are currently on their way back now my family realizes that we have to try and get him help as this is his time running away in the past months among other destructive things hes been doing like dwis and plan on doing some sort of family intervention to talk to him about this and the fact that he needs to get evaluated and get help do you have any recommendations on ways to approach him any safety tips we should keep in mind what ours first steps should be who to reach out to im not sure how hell react when we tell him that we believe he has this illness
television,not_removed,i dunno if is one of the a lot youre referring to but i want to be clear that i know its very different the voices as depicted in the video do have a lot in common with the thought patterns i can slip into sometimes and i thought it was interesting thats all id never call it the same thing but i did call it familiar because it is
television,not_removed,while it is the description mean voices in your head gets the point of the simulator through
television,not_removed,well thats what the headphones are doing
television,not_removed,exactly edit the person deleted the comment so you cant see the joke it was a dumb comment that was something like thats aweful or hes awful or something i dont remember
television,not_removed,spending the rest of my life with my best friend by my side is a shitty dream
television,not_removed,psychopath is an outdated term and there is more to it than just being unable to empathize there are plenty of people who struggle with empathy but wouldnt be considered psychopaths
television,not_removed,are you talking to yourself op merely voiced his opinion
television,not_removed,you dont like my opinion so you strawman it by labelling it edgy i dont even understand what you are trying to say do you think it is trendy to be schizophrenic i was being serious and i think maybe you are projecting your ideas onto my comment
television,not_removed,do you think you have any worth alive pushes daisies
television,not_removed,yes they are not useless babies stuck in their minds it is very difficult to learn to deal with the voices but there are many many ways to work with them and be a functional person i hate to think people seeing this video think its a hopeless worthless life to live everyone forgets that these voices come from inside the person they are a manifestation of their thoughts feelings and fears its not some meaningless spooky audio being broadcasted to you like in this video theres lots of options for dealing with it but a lot of support understanding and care is needed to get there
television,not_removed,yeah
television,not_removed,thank you for the clarification i was worried for a second
television,not_removed,your pies are a disgrace
television,not_removed,well i feel sorry for you i hope you find whatever it is in life that will make you happy and kind i hope you find redemption for the kind of person you chose to be today
television,not_removed,dont look both ways next time you cross the street
television,not_removed,no i have no nostalgia for commercials and nor would i ever want to go back to viewing them anything the least bit ideologically challenging will be banned because some tumblrina will get triggered complete nonsense
television,not_removed,i havent had cable in years im a cord never getter not a cord cutter i am not nostalgic or reminiscent of any commercials i watched a bit of tv at my parents house over christmas and jesus christ it was a painful experience
television,not_removed,i hate that tv station have to go through the soft monopoly that is cable its a fine medium but modern greed has destroyed it
television,not_removed,i know how to internet enough to get whatever i want in time
television,not_removed,i only watch television on tv with friends because then you dont have to decide what to watch and commercials a good for getting snacks pee breaks etc however i live in denmark and streaming is the fastest way to get a fresh new episode of a series since it takes a lot of time for our tv stations to get permission to air set show so if you want to watch game of thrones vikings etc hbos streaming is the easiest way of getting it also netflix shows have a higher quality than most tv network shows have and the freedom of binging and pausing is nifty
television,not_removed,my opinion i have loved without cable since ill never go back we have amazon hulu and netflix those and youtube are all i need all of those are commercial free all but youtube but i dont mind a second ad once when i left cable the commercials were extremely over volume of that of the show and the breaks were too long and too frequent sure there were a couple good commercials but nothing id say im sentimental about life without ads and commercials is a life better lived
television,not_removed,any show thats not an instant hit will not be put on the streaming library pretty much everything is streaming in some form or fashion these days anything the least bit ideologically challenging will be banned because some tumblrina will get triggered im not even sure what you mean hey if you want to watch commercials go for it the networks thank you
television,not_removed,commercials are designed to make you feel that your life isnt good enough unless you buy their stuff i dont need a quarter of my television watching time to be spent being taught that my life sucks with that in mind ive been cutting commercials out of my life for nearly decades now the only downside is that i generally dont know what movies are in theaters a small price to pay
television,not_removed,i exclusively use streaming these days theres a vanishingly small number of things that i cant legally see soon after they air ive been streaming only for probably years by now and dont regret the switch at all
television,not_removed,anything the least bit ideologically challenging will be banned because some tumblrina will get triggered this is kinda hilarious to me considering that netflix is actively going around paying for things that would never be shown on basic american cable without serious watering down black mirror and is driving the current war for content among the streaming services and traditional television outlets i like plenty of traditional programming fine but lets not kid ourselves here if you cant find something to watch on streaming services these days youre not really looking
television,not_removed,the problem isnt the nostalgia commercials bring its the frequency you used to get a good minutes of show to minutes of ads now its minutes of show to minutes of ads guesstimate yes there is a certain aspect to watching live tv that newer generations wont understand but its not some religious experience that you must experience firsthand the cord cutters can watch an hour show in minutes with ads sprinkled in sure not every show or every season of every show will be available for streaming but we adapt and overcome times change theres no right or wrong way to enjoy a show as long as youre enjoying it
television,not_removed,i can deny any proposition that can be constructed in any language but even if i dont nothing you said about commercials represents any sort of meaningful argument against streaming if you really want to watch commercials then im sure you can find some on youtube
television,not_removed,commercials i personally do not like them and try to avoid them as much as possible the main reasons time tired of celebs pitching items to me did i mention time variety i personally do not agree with you regarding the types of shows on the streaming services for my purposes netflix amazon hulu they have a pretty wide variety regarding the types of shows plus with the quality of the shows on those services i am unsure why you think they are lesser than traditional tv at least for us we watch content on both broadcast tv and streaming services i think the competition has benefited us as consumers
television,not_removed,it works for life today available on multiple media devices less expensive to view can watch many shows with less or no commercials
television,not_removed,im sorry are you mocking me or did you just type to fast im actually asking
television,not_removed,i think the sentiment is that streaming services tend to play it safe and its not wrong
television,not_removed,typo but i do have my way to be able to watch whatever i want whenever i want adless and for free
television,not_removed,streaming services play it safer than network tv now i know you cant be serious
television,not_removed,in terms of adult andor challenging content then yes most of the stuff on netflix and hulu is very mainstream even on netflix home grown material it you bleep out the swear words then theres not much that rises above the level of im not saying that its not well done a lot of it is quality stuff but its safe youtube is very different as thats almost all user curated
television,not_removed,i was just wondering on friday about season not enough to look anything up but i had the passing thought thanks for this
television,not_removed,to me that trailer was terrible just a random montage of inane situations instead of actual jokes can anyone tell me whether the show itself is actually funny
television,not_removed,and now you know
television,not_removed,one of the funniest and most sincere things airing right now the trailer didnt do anything for me either
television,not_removed,its a funny show but nothing groundbreaking its entertaining especially if you like patrick stewart theres no real plot and instead its stewart just getting into shenanigans with his assistantbutler
television,not_removed,its hilarious this trailer doesnt represent the quality of the show first season at least
television,not_removed,its a pretty great show imo
television,not_removed,i want answers
television,not_removed,the blurays comes out on march so i doubt there will be digital copies available until near then
television,not_removed,wouldnt digital of this show be like over a terabyte even compressed
television,not_removed,oh okay thanks ill look into it in another month then
television,not_removed,im looking to stream it so i dont care much my down can handle it if i dont do much else also its probably closer to for all the episodes
television,not_removed,do you mean diner and is it involved a man sitting at a dinner and then it would show humorous accidents the entire premise is it a cartoon or a sketch comedy what country throw us a bone if i were to guess id say fawlty towers
television,not_removed,either or personal comment i wish ellen muth had acted in more things
television,not_removed,miss that show good old toilet seat george
television,not_removed,most of the time they still take a break between production runs but it does give the writers and producers a much firmer basis to work from it can help with things like studio rentals and that sort of thing sometimes you can get a better rate if you lock in early and it can also help with writing because they know theyll almost certainly be back so they might be more willing to create longer arcs
television,not_removed,something called a bump happens between seasons its essentially a contractual pay rise for cast writers and producers and sometimes an increase in participation points a percentage of revenue the show earns they must be doing good work if the shows being kept around for this reason cable shows sometimes put in a large order episodes or so then split the episodes over two years this means theyre getting seasons without having to bump the pay a bit cheaper so noones going to do work on any episodes that would come after a bump youre going to do the work eventually and be paid a bit more money for it when you do however the longer lead time does mean writers will have a bigger plan that they can pencil in
television,not_removed,they still fill the seasons separately although they could do either way if they wanted to
television,not_removed,it allows them to plan ahead especially in plotting but shows that were renewed for multiple seasons have still been cancelled between seasons eg farscape so probably best not to spend too much production money on second season content until the second season money starts rolling in for animation they renew years in advance because its cheaper if they can work more than a year in advance
television,not_removed,i dont get how it is viewed as espn specifically losing subscribers espn is part of most basic cable packages so how is it that its just espn specifically losing subscribers
television,not_removed,quelle surprise
television,not_removed,i love the cogent argument and i love that being able to pick your channels may soon be a thing and i hope somewhere in this argument comcast starts losing money
television,not_removed,it is because espn used to be part of the basic cable package but now it isnt for many providers lots of cable packages require you to pay extra for sports including espn so while technically espn is losing subscribers they were basically boosted for so many years by people paying for espn without actually wanting it cordcutters are a large issue as well but i think it is more people not paying for premium sports packages
television,not_removed,down they go
television,not_removed,it is mostly just general cord cutting but the antiespn jerk is strong on reddit so them losing subscribers gets mentioned literally every month when the numbers come out if you look at the chart espn only lost slightly more than total cable did i have cable and i couldnt get rid of just espn even if i wanted to it is basic cable if you have cable you have espn
television,not_removed,espn charges distributors a monthly fee of per subscriber and another cents for according to snl kagan an offering of sp global market intelligence the cost for espn is up more than percent from when it was per subscriber for chicagoarea subscribers csn chicago the primary tv home for the cubs white sox blackhawks and bulls is the next highest at per month no other channel sports and otherwise is even close fox news has a monthly fee and cnn is at cents
television,not_removed,i think its because espn is part of a package and people are cablecutting
television,not_removed,i think its because espn is increasing being booted off basic cable packages and into premium packages for example fios doesnt have espn on their basic level i think comcast has a basic package without espn too but im not sure
television,not_removed,because narrative
television,not_removed,its a strange narrative that get clicks like many other media stories in reality the only people that should give a shit about this are disney shareholders the larger picture is that yes people are cordcutting to the tune of a half million per quarter or more the only reason espn factors into the media reporting is because espn is the one of the largest if not the largest piece of the basic cable pie in terms of fees meaning espn is a major reason cable costs so much and it used to be a major reason why people felt they needed cable
television,not_removed,the problem for espn is that what they used to have a nearly monopoly on sports news was basically obliterated by the internet and they never figured out a way to take advantage of the web espndisney should have poured a fuck ton into creating a streaming sports giant they should have cut huge deals with the major sports leagues for rights to not just highlights but to marquee events to stream live and ondemand
television,not_removed,its not just that live sports is one of the top reasons people say they wont cut cable espnabc carries almost every college bowl game at this point its also along the most expensive channels the fact they are losing subscribers a half a million at a time means that a previous stalwart defense for cable companies is losing its effectiveness espn is a bellwether for how well cable is doing this is not a good sign if youre one of those conglomerates
television,not_removed,some cable companies now have super basic tiers that only have local channels they sometimes make your internet cheaper and they help cordcutters too far from broadcast towers so some people get them also i know dish has more granular tv packages i discovered this when i visited my father in law and found out he had dish but not espn
television,not_removed,uhcant speak to the specifics but i know for a fact my father has a basic cable package and does not get espn it is certainly possible to have cable without having espn
television,not_removed,yep you could no more unsubscribe from espn than you could from cnn or fox news yet somehow cable losing subscribers always seems to translate to only espn
television,not_removed,you can get espn from vue sling etc cable and satellite are dead man walking of course the man wont go down without a fight hence directv now etc which will turn into a net neutrality killer and for which you will pay over a month in a few years unless we get a new congress soon that stops this predatory anti innovation behavior
television,not_removed,this is correct the only thing i care about seeing on espn is possibly monday night football which i just now see with friends at the local bar
television,not_removed,espndisney should have poured a fuck ton into creating a streaming sports giant they should have cut huge deals with the major sports leagues for rights to not just highlights but to marquee events to stream live and ondemand content costs are why they havent its not that disney doesnt want all the sports they dont have the monopoly on sports broadcasting that they used to and have to compete against comcast fox cbs bein and the leagues themselves who all also have sports networks that need content
television,not_removed,and then netflix and hulu lose almost all of their price advantage against cable im not sure thats a good move
television,not_removed,imo the leagues need to start offering streaming on their own without local blackouts all i watch is college football and nba i would gladly buy and ncaaf package and nba league pass but the former doesnt exist and he latter blocks the cavs because i live in ohio i dont really care for the nfl mlb nhl mls premier league ncaabb nascar poker and whatever other stuff makes its way onto tv
television,not_removed,thats part of it however espn never had that many live sports to begin with they used to have mlb once a week and for a couple years they had nhl once a week espndisney maybe even abc predisney merger had the money to spend and did not if they would have judge the internet and its potential better they could have established a sports streaming strangle hold they dont need to have every single game from every league but they certainly needed more than on football game a week
television,not_removed,when we can subscribe to sportsflix my life is complete i dont care if it doesnt appear until after the game airs live i miss of the weeks sporting events because i am too busy having a streaming sports subscription service would be a dream come true
television,not_removed,can already get a few sports like thatnhl mls mlb i know for sure have online streaming services mls is notorious for local blackouts though which kind of makes it useless in some markets
television,not_removed,every online sports service nba mls mlb nhl has local blackouts i believe some also blackout national televised games as well so really they are only useful if you live away from your team and in conjunction with a cable subscription
television,not_removed,it depends i use the nhl and mls ones and i dont get asked out in my own market toronto it depends on the stance of the team ownership
television,not_removed,interesting httpsgamecentreliverogerscomensupportgameavailabilityco is that not the case
television,not_removed,dont know what to tell you never had a problem with blackouts within the city
television,not_removed,all of these villains will be in their when batman comes around i really hope they give jim gordon the role of batman
television,not_removed,i havent watched this show yet how is it
television,not_removed,really hope this season improves the last season was better but it just feels bland but not arrow bland mind you i hope to maybe see something more psychological especially since the court of owls is in play and looks like strange will be back it always plays around with the idea but just does it so cartoonish that its hard to enjoy
television,not_removed,i actually really like it the first season starts out really rough as some of the characters start out really unlikable or boring with some strange acting fish mooney is awful and has never gotten better but the show becomes really compelling and the characters start to grow on you you feel invested doubly so if youre open to a different interpretation of the batman mythos however ive also seen people say its awful in every way i could never say its awful but i could see why people wouldnt like it ive heard a lot of complaints focused on the interpretation of batman and the characters of the comics which i cant really qualify as i only have a surface level understanding of the world which helps id say if you can watch the first season on netflix and dont like it by the end time investment i know then its not for you plus morena baccarin might be the most beautiful women ive ever seen and shes a prominent character
television,not_removed,its decent some of the characters feel kind of cartoonish though and dont go in expecting to see batman
television,not_removed,kind of suffers from the same thing agents of shield did in its first season having to build the show and characters without using the superstar on shield this is the avengers on gotham its batman and arguably the joker picks up a bit at the end of season and quite good in season
television,not_removed,not very good but it beats the dccw
television,not_removed,the reason season two was better was because that fish thing wasnt in it but now shes back ugh
television,not_removed,i dont think this is nearly as good as the flash
television,not_removed,totally agree a big reason why people vs oj worked was the largerthanlife casting of people whom you saw straight through to the actor we already know so much about oj and the people around him that picking actors who simply fit the part perfectly would have just made it a boring dramatization having cuba and travolta and schwimmer out there chewing scenery made this an event yet it was balanced by two of the best most nuanced castings in tv history sarah paulson as marcia clark and courtney b vance as johnny cochran ironically the two biggest personalities from the case after oj and both are taking home emmy statues as a result to a lesser extent sterling k brown as darden too who was fantastic
television,not_removed,sarah paulson and courtney vance not the three you mentioned made the show gooding was poorly cast and the other two were uneven
television,not_removed,travolta was a unique situation in that it was a terrible impression if shapiro but it was great acting so it worked
television,not_removed,couldnt help but be surprised vance wasnt mentioned in op he was literally the perfect cochrane i said before it was like they raised the actual cochrane from the dead and hoped nobody would notice
television,not_removed,i swear if those two paulson and vance dont each win every award there is its a travesty
television,not_removed,i read that he was cast because of how likable and personable he is if we all woke up one day with headlines like cuba gooding jr murdered his wife the world would be shocked much like how they were with oj
television,not_removed,an issue i had with cuba was how he didnt look very large and imposing oj is really big so if cuba had the same physicality of oj i think it would have been more believable
television,not_removed,yeah i wasnt a big fan of gooding but he was the only casting choice i wasnt big on he still did a decent job though
television,not_removed,i found cbj to be pretty good hes smiley narcissistic and smiley needy and smiley amorally hard shelled pathologically scary too
television,not_removed,funnily enough i think that vance wouldve made a great oj as well i have to believe at some point they were looking at him and thinking shit hes probably perfect for both of these roles
television,not_removed,vance is brilliant paulson too but he doesnt resonate in the same way as cgj schwimmer and travolta as iconic stars of the now playing characters in a period drama this is the thing that i found intriguing another level to the people v oj i feel that the whole drama gained enormously from such casting
television,not_removed,well what can i say i have read your comments and i would not be surprised at all if it turned out you were accused of domestic kiddy diddling
television,not_removed,why is everyone obsessed with netflix publishing their viewer numbers its not relevant to netflixs business model since they dont sell advertising
television,not_removed,because it reveals just how true tales of mass cord cutting really are or if they are bunk which so far they have turned out to be
television,not_removed,they still need people watching their shows same case with hbo the difference is that people know right away when a hbo show fails so they have to appeal to the investors and cant renew a failure that is the good thing about netflix shows get a second chance marco polo would probably get cancelled on hbo
television,not_removed,i want to see realistic numbers on how many cord cutters turn to netflix amazon hulu or khm somewhere else
television,not_removed,ummm racism against whites is just plain racism
television,not_removed,racism is not directional forward or reverse racism promulgated by black people is still racism
television,not_removed,so people are pissed because he didnt include a black character after making numerous movies with all black characters is he not allowed to try something different in its america
television,not_removed,we just call that racism mr perry since its a show made by you i still wont watch it but its nice that youre trying to equitable youre a good actor though you should do more of that
television,not_removed,that bit in the middle im just finding out more as i travel the country and world the more i meet people were all the same he said we all got the same dramas so im not seeing color as much as i did anymore in the sense of our stories our stories are so similar we need a lot more of this
television,not_removed,omg there is no such thing as fucking reverse racism it is just racism everyone has to be fucking special
television,not_removed,holy shit the guy is saying racism is bad and how were all the same and the top comments here are only about the term he used jesus christ people
television,not_removed,im just finding out more as i travel the country and world the more i meet people were all the same he said we all got the same dramas so im not seeing color as much as i did anymore in the sense of our stories our stories are so similar semantics are important sure but this seems pretty god damn innocuous is that really a sentiment worth getting angry about
television,not_removed,i swear tyler perry is one of the most annoying people at times
television,not_removed,i thought he was making a series about tlc the black girl group and was upset hed cast white girls for black roles but i just realized tlc is a channel
television,not_removed,tyler perry is racist because he plays multiple black peoples roles in one movie thus stealing work from black people
television,not_removed,blacks and hispanics need to look at the discrimination of native americans and indianamericans in filmtv now that shits racist i think its fucking stupid race even needed to be talked about in this instance what is the purpose why cant a filmmakertv producer writer just write a fucking story without being raped by peoples completely pointless opinions just sit the fuck down shut your cock holster and enjoy one of our many dying forms of art in this country edit world replaced with country
television,not_removed,im not a fan of tyler perrys work but i appreciate how he has provided work for black actors and entertainment for black audiences even if i dont like it even as a black dude so i think its pretty disappointing to see him saying dumb stuff like reverse racism and that he doesnt see color
television,not_removed,this guy think by himself and not what the media tell us to do props to him however since racism is only important when it happens to nonwhite people this information will be lost and nobody will know about it the fact that its called reverse racism comes from this we have been recently taught that racism only exist from white people to other nonwhite people and white people cant be object of racism
television,not_removed,glad i could help in whatever way its so difficult to navigate the intellectual mine field of arguments nowadays its taken awhile for me to sharpen that one haha
television,not_removed,wouldnt reverse racism to be to love everyone
television,not_removed,the same people who applaud allblack writing teams and casts the same useless people who cant create their way out of a paper bag but always have something to say about those who do please disappear from the face of the earth and do it as quickly as possible please
television,not_removed,youre the one trying to pit the races nice donald trump move though always spin it so youre the victim
television,not_removed,he even has an episode about it in master of none
television,not_removed,his shows have more than a large african american ensemble cast his shows and movies are quite blatantly targeted specifically for an african american audience that is in no way a bad thing but it makes his whining about being abandoned by his black audience a bit laughable when he has eschewed most of the population to cater to his intended argument up until this point considering that his claim to fame so far has been madea im not sure hes going to do great with white audiences either
television,not_removed,i am very skeptical of any claims of initial criticism andor interest in this show before this story
television,not_removed,thats because after years of watching him make shows with black casts white people have already learned the rule that anything that starts with the words tyler perrys is complete shit
television,not_removed,close to home is amazing ive never seen a show quite like it its just total awful gonzo soap opera and it has cowboy tarzan its terrible shoddy tv but fantastic at the same time
television,not_removed,ffs its just racism not reverse racism
television,not_removed,i think its funny that entertainment weekly posts the exact same story from a few months ago with even less detail
television,not_removed,posts about race here and rmovies always end the same white posters not so subtly pitting black people against asianshispanicsnative americans and a few wayward members of those groups joining in on the division divide and conquer tactics continue to work in the century i see
television,not_removed,does anybody really care
television,not_removed,tyler perry the prolific filmmaker filmmaker ͡° ͜ʖ ͡° i chuckled here a little
television,not_removed,msicar is a blight on society
television,not_removed,but in filmtv you can find latino and black actorsactresses playing roles that arent the stereotype tell me that last time a native american or indian american wasnt stereotyped in filmtv im not really try to down playing blacks or latinos but in this instance film and such there are people who are being misrepresented more
television,not_removed,boy bye he and his flop career can kick rocks
television,not_removed,this is an amazingly transparently stupid issue i cant fathom how educated people suddenly dont understand the documented definition of words when its associated with a cause theyve been told to support and for some reason discuss solely in rhetoric and propaganda speak i dont understand how so many people have adopted the conventions of right wing propaganda so gradually they havent noticed themselves we might have different social issues today but what exactly stopped people from listening as well as speaking
television,not_removed,if that were not true what would racism be called if an arab insulted a chinese man degree racism
television,not_removed,yes but racism against a black person for choosing white people by black people is actually reverse racism i dont like the term but it seems apt here
television,not_removed,i think racism involves the power structure without that its just bigotry
television,not_removed,im pretty sure the show does have a black character in it lol like i get why people get irked by sell outs but nothing of value is really lost here most black people loathe his work and rightfully so its riddled with sexism stereotypes colorism and misogynoir its great that hes given work to black actors but theres better quality black shows on tv at the moment
television,not_removed,the reality is there are so few black people making television shows the fans are likely a little territorial you cant blame them if he and shonda died thats like percent of the black of shows run by black people would go with them
television,not_removed,he was great in gone girl so i wish he took on more roles in movies in general that werent ones he was involved in writing development etc
television,not_removed,the premise does sound pretty interesting have you seen the family that preys
television,not_removed,wtf i like tyler perry now honestly i do kinda like him ever since his brilliant delivery of the best line in gone girl you two are the most fuckedup people i have ever met and i specialize in fuckedup people
television,not_removed,while he isnt perfect tyler parry does his job better than you do your job i wouldnt dismiss his show as something not to watch because he made it and we do not need to split hairs about racism vs reverse racism when there are real issues
television,not_removed,not really theres nothing wrong with seeing color and claiming not to see it is to erase peoples unique lived experiences seeing color isnt bad mistreating or misrepresenting people because of their color whichever the shade is
television,not_removed,reverse racism is a stupid term but people need to chill the fuck out its used because most of the institutional racism in the west traditionally favors whites and persecutes blacks this is the reverse of the norm all the bitching over minor grammatical abuse is overshadowing what is actually a fairly interesting story
television,not_removed,what did you expect i knew what the comments would be on reddit before this story even made it here lol
television,not_removed,the term he used insinuates that racism can only be something white people do and that black people cant be racist against whites that line of thinking is bullshit and needs to go away i understand what tyler perry is trying to say but using that term propagates this bullshit idea
television,not_removed,the guy is saying racism is bad and how were all the same and the top comments here are only about the term he used i think most people already agree that racism is bad well those outside of a trump rally anyway so theyre discussing the part they dont agree with
television,not_removed,that is hilarious
television,not_removed,tlc stood for the learning channel at one point they had medical documentaries and the like for a long time now all they air are things like honey boo boo and other shitty reality tv shows
television,not_removed,dont throw us latinos in there bro were under represented in a lot of ways too
television,not_removed,when black people are underachieving its our fault and were blamed for not working hard enough like those other model minorities when black people are achieving were suddenly overrepresented and somehow its magically our fault that other races are underrepresented nice attempt to pit races against each other but its not going to work on anyone with a brain
television,not_removed,youd be surprised how many white people are in the theater to watch those movies
television,not_removed,you truly honestly believe theres some conspiracy by the evil white man to divide the poor innocent people of color many minorities are way more openly racist against one another than anyone else ive ever seen just go to vancouver and see how well the indian and chinese communities get along people are just fucking racist but you know that since youre probably a racist who hates white people
television,not_removed,aziz ansari
television,not_removed,flop career man is making bank
television,not_removed,he is on the list of highest net worth actors and for black actors ahead of people like cosby samuel l jackson and denzel i think its fair to say hes done alright for himself
television,not_removed,lol agreed his work is mostly shit
television,not_removed,you dont get to redefine the english language just because it makes it easier to declare yourself the winner in arguments
television,not_removed,ah fuck now i gotta bust out a protractor
television,not_removed,thats just plain racism as well
television,not_removed,no it isnt
television,not_removed,so if white people are pissed at a white person for hiring black people thats also reverse racism
television,not_removed,reverse racism is things like hiring the black guy because he is black youre doing a beneficial thingusually to not look racist but your motivation is still racisttreating a person differently due to their race
television,not_removed,this only works if black people remain oppressed in every instance of racism thats simply not the case so racism has to be a generalized term secondary to that would be defining who is being suppressed by it and for what reasons
television,not_removed,care to elaborate on the power structure
television,not_removed,somebody taught you a load of old shit
television,not_removed,so poor white people cannot be racist either
television,not_removed,no it doesnt look the word up power isnt in there
television,not_removed,types of power economic social political personal violence examples of powerful positions manager middle manager father president bishop pope mother soldier gang member ceo lawyer singer producer executive business owner banker etc groups of people that have no power none groups of people that have a shitload of power every single major ethnic group
television,not_removed,this is what is being spouted when people finally realized the black card wasnt getting them anywhere also if you have the power and freedom to speak out and insult a group of people you have the power to be racist anyone individual crying that black people have no power is doing nothing but that crying no wonder they havent obtained any power or respect its a big fish small bowl type deal they refuse to do any work in the real world to obtain influence or power so scary with all those people out there trying to do the same thing would like to note that didnt stop obama so they obtain it in the small bowl of people that buy and eat up all their bullshit
television,not_removed,without that its just bigotry racism is bigotry based on race
television,not_removed,typical sjw moving the goal posts
television,not_removed,racism only ever refers to judging based only on race and at that its not necessarily bad for example saying black people tend to have curly hair is racist but true and not bad
television,not_removed,lot of down votes but yeah ukazamasmokers is right in order to participate in racism you need power academically its often referred to as prejudice plus power
television,not_removed,youre correct but the whites dont like hearing that because then they cant pretend to be victims
television,not_removed,black people are like of the population if anything theyre already over represented in entertainment
television,not_removed,til having a black main character makes it a black show
television,not_removed,they have bet and oprahs channel which has mostly black people in all their shows
television,not_removed,he was bad in the alex cross movie he did not believable as a leading man but hes a good supporting player
television,not_removed,i have not
television,not_removed,im not actually sure he does but thanks weirdo
television,not_removed,i dont think the color of peoples skin has anything to do with peoples unique lived experiences if you want to understand peoples lived experiences you can talk to them rather than assuming things based on their skin color which is exactly what tyler perry is talking about doing here also you dont erase someones lived experiences even if you choose not to acknowledge them your lived experiences are in your head another persons thoughts and beliefs cant erase them
television,not_removed,exactly
television,not_removed,i agree and in any case the racism here is pretty minor just some criticism but sometimes minor grammatical stuff does matter the term reverse kind of makes sense because usually racism goes against black people so here its in the reverse direction but consider if for example a woman rapes a man we dont say it was reverse rape its rape the same works for positive things too if a woman proposes to her boyfriend we dont say its a reverse proposal its a proposal adding reverse to any of these things separates them from what is perhaps the more common case and the question is why do we want to separate them i think thats the debate here this isnt just with reverse of course for example if gay people get married do we always need to refer to it as they got gay married no they just got married and happen to be gay
television,not_removed,no it doesnt he used the term the same way any random white guy would without thinking about the term its silly but its commonly used it doesnt mean it was maliciously used
television,not_removed,disagree or not there was no intent behind the word and thats the problem judge a person by their intent not by a buzz word
television,not_removed,open a history book youll quickly learn that hierarchies have been kept in tact for thousands of years by using the same strategy divide the population give a few special privileges to one group and theyll fight to keep their favor and all the other groups will fight against each other instead overcoming oppression as a whole
television,not_removed,aziz ansari plays up the stereotype though hes made good money off of it thus far so why would he quit while hes ahead
television,not_removed,minorities in america but not in the universe
television,not_removed,youre gonna hurt somebodys feelings if you keep bring so realistic and honest
television,not_removed,i know your are bieng sacrcastic but as someone who is not white but see non white people being racist all the time and get away with it it reallys pisses me off
television,not_removed,yes white people in your sentence will be called the purples and black people the greens if a purple dislikes a green it is racism if a green dislikes a purple it is racism if a purple dislikes another purple for hiring a green it is reverse racism
television,not_removed,i disagree with you i think that is racism
television,not_removed,nope but together they can elect one
television,not_removed,you have a poor understanding of the way the world works
television,not_removed,damn i cant tell if this response is bigoted or racist
television,not_removed,anyone individual crying that black people have no power is doing nothing but that crying no wonder they havent obtained any power or respect yeah they just need to shut up about their problems and just fix them without talking like some sort of activist mimes and of course you know youre right because some of them make bad arguments you know like how all those other black women that sat on the wrong side of the bus before rosa parks showed blacks didnt deserve bus privileges because they where singleteen mothers etc
television,not_removed,what
television,not_removed,a lot of down votes because theyre propagating a bullshit redefining of a word that exists only to match with peoples agendas racial discrimination is racism no matter who does it
television,not_removed,academia doesnt have the authority to change the meaning of a word
television,not_removed,can you explain what you mean by power because afaik the only requirement for racism seems to be ignorance
television,not_removed,id like to hear your opinion just because im curious as to what goes on in the mind of a complete and utter fucking idiot
television,not_removed,what youre talking about is considered institutional racism the idea behind it is prejudicepower equals racism its something that has grown recently in academia but most people consider racism by its old definition prejudice based on race unfortunately most people fail to mention this when they talk about their definition of racism hence ukazamasmokers problem in this thread hes using the institutional racism definition most people arent
television,not_removed,prejudice plus power equals oppression anyone can be racist
television,not_removed,yup but this is reddit filled with white men who have an oppression complex are you surprised its downvoted lol
television,not_removed,dont bother man reddit is an extremely populist community saying academic just gets their panties more in a bunch its just going to make you tired and sad
television,not_removed,obviously anyone can be a victim of bigotry
television,not_removed,uh so white people are of american population lets look at casting demographics in movies and its like white leading roles are like white youre right that black people are overrepresented but so are white people with that logic
television,not_removed,a bigger problem is the type of representation is really poor well talk about over representation when more than of leading roles across genres go to black male and female actors of various skintones also nice sourceless conjecture
television,not_removed,to be fair a lot of movies and tv shows are filmed in major cities like la or new york city or at least take place there a lot of major cities range from being white i wouldnt say that black people are totally overrepresented because we should at least take the setting into account a lot of the time id say that theyre adequately represented or sometimes underrepresented according to the setting im just saying since ive seen people complain about the walking dead being too diverse or not having enough asian characters besides glenn even though the story took place in georgia which is like black and asian
television,not_removed,hardly you have a channels on cable how many have leads of any color not even percent the presentation is not proportional its good business for casts to be diverse
television,not_removed,racism is over everyone they have two channels on the teevee
television,not_removed,depends on whos the director i suppose alex cross was done by rob cohen gone girlby david fincher stark difference between the two edit apologies for the other similar responses reddit was running slow on me so when i initially clicked submit after a minute it still hasnt done anything so i clicked it again and twice more when that didnt work
television,not_removed,i think he spent his time working out instead of working on his lines dude is jacked in that movie
television,not_removed,he was a strong point however small in a movie that had tons of strong points
television,not_removed,his best film from a directorial standpoint imo good cast as well its worth a watch if youre not doing anything
television,not_removed,i am weirdo enough to know that just because you arent always the target audience for tyler parrys message that doesnt mean he is a poor communicator the world doesnt have to constantly kiss the ass of a young white american male if you dont understand what he means by reverse racism than that stupidity is on you not him
television,not_removed,i dont think the color of peoples skin has anything to do with peoples unique lived experiences might wanna run that by some black people i dont understand how years after jim crow some people think our society is magically colorblind
television,not_removed,i dont think the color of peoples skin has anything to do with peoples unique lived experiences if you want to understand peoples lived experiences you can talk to them rather than assuming things based on their skin color its not about assuming things like looking at a black dude and assuming that because hes black he had no father because of the history of us race relations and the influence that the past continues to have on the present in systemic cultural intercultural and personal ways and more yes skin color does have an influence on lived experience even assuming they share the same socioeconomic class family background etc a white kid an asian kid and a latino kid growing up in the us are going to have different experiences because our lives our codified in contexts broader than ourselves this isnt inherently a bad thing its only bad when the consequences are other people or systems mistreating us because of our different skin tones or backgrounds also you dont erase someones lived experiences even if you choose not to acknowledge them your lived experiences are in your head another persons thoughts and beliefs cant erase them i wasnt being literal obviously ignoring that someone is black doesnt erase the black persons past from the fabric of time let me rephrase then claiming not to see color is to dismiss how a persons skin color has influenced their past present future culture heritage family etc im a black dude you telling me that you dont see color says to me that you dont see challenges that i face because of my race you dont see things that im proud of about my culture thats to an extent unique about my culture see color see black yellow white red brown etc just respect it and appreciate it too
television,not_removed,he used the term the same way any random white guy would disagree it doesnt mean it was maliciously used i dont think he was trying to be malicious just ignorant
television,not_removed,youre the one whos basically saying that history comes down to white people vs everyone else and youre complaining about others dividing the population nonwhites greatly outnumber whites on a worldwide scale so if theyre all in such firm agreement that white people are the problem and are somehow able to control a much larger number of people then why not rise up and take control oh maybe because its not as simple as that and every race has discriminated and oppressed other races since time began
television,not_removed,im not supposed to say this but weve hid an extra three billion white people underneath utah
television,not_removed,what
television,not_removed,found a white person
television,not_removed,it is racism its just a specific subcategory of racism that supposedly doesnt harm the personalthough i disagree with this
television,not_removed,instead of just down voting i really wanna know why you think that does a poc store manager not have power over his employees can he not use this power to be racist and choose one race to fill positions side note giga pudding was my ringtone for a year and i can never forget it
television,not_removed,no i dont there are many types of power in the world and the vast majority of people have at least a little if i was to sit down with the president of the united states beyonce and the pope at a table and then pull out a glock then in that moment i would be the most powerful man at the table assuming they were alone and unarmed i could rob the pope because i hate catholics i could rape beyonce because im sick son of a bitch or i could kill barack because i hate black people the gun gives me the power to act on any of my preconceived hatreds my bigotry transcends mere thought crime and becomes a genuine hate crime the ability to project overwhelming violence temporarily supersedes any of their political social or economic power they have over me the white daughter of a corrupt judge is a very powerful person but if she finds herself in a bad neighborhood surrounded by black thugs who decide to rape her because they feel that as a white woman she deserves it then their power of numbers and superior strength supersedes anything her father could do in that moment in time if barack obama used his power to drone muslims in the middle east simply because they were muslim then that would also be a hate crime if a korean manager decides he hates mexicans and fires as many as he can then that is another example everyone has at least a little bit of power and is always capable of acquiring more but more importantly every group has a cumulative shitton of power blacks whites asians jews christians muslims etcincluded
television,not_removed,neither also not sure if you are comprehend of the definition of either
television,not_removed,well you ignored the fact that the second word you quoted was individual keep on your sjw crusade you will surely win
television,not_removed,you could try reading your old posts
television,not_removed,and as always us hispanics are left in the cold because apparently no one gives a shit that were the largest minority population in the us its always more black people but screw the hispanics
television,not_removed,to in movies makes sense if you want a domestic hit and people really see movies starting people of their own race which i dont really believe as there havent been enough movies starting minorities that have flopped to really calculate anything substantial the hypothesis needs to be tested rather than assumed of the how many go to the movies at least once a month can they make a movie hit million at the box office if not and if we assume people only see movies that star people of their race which i doubt and frankly i think very little of you if you only see movies starring black people or starting white people it makes more financial sense to cast a white lead and actually make money it doesnt help that of movies with all black casts are very bad movies with poor reviews either and those are the ones that make money from black audiences why is moonlight doing no business while tyler perry halloween and almost christmas rake in cash hopefully more quality movies with black leads become big financial hits then well see more of them black panther better be one of the biggest superhero movies of all time or else people need to stop complaining about wanting more minority leads same with wonder woman and female leads obviously if the movies are bad i wont blame race or gender of poor box office performance but what if both are on rt yet perform modestly technically speaking we actually need more asian actors in lead roles they are a huge chunk of the worlds population and asian people do flock to movies starring asian people they go see movies where a famous asian person just has a cameo its crazy
television,not_removed,got a source for these ridiculous statistics
television,not_removed,white people being blamed for jewish nepotism winwin
television,not_removed,cable isnt the only form of entertainment though what about sports and music the nfl is near black not too many calls to get more skinny jewish dudes in there for some reason
television,not_removed,it speaks volumes that youre downvoted for actually posting sources but someone above is upvoted for assuming black people are overrepresented isnt it
television,not_removed,who said he was a poor communicator i understand what the word means but like the redundant bureau of redundancy department its not really necessary
television,not_removed,you say its not about assuming things but youve gone on to list all of the things i can assume because of your race like that you face certain challenges because of it i dont buy that every black person has had the same experience as you with reference to their race if this kind of thinking is not about assuming things what is it about in order to gain any meaningful insight about someone based on their race you have to assume that their race is somehow inextricably linked to some experience i know black people that didnt grow up cartoonishly poor with an alcoholic mother and an absentee father like myself i cant assume your culture based on your skin color i cant assume your economic status i cant assume your politics i cant assume anything at this point not even that youve been mistreated or discriminated against its a gross and divisive mentality as far as im concerned the idea that skin color is somehow tied to culture to me is pretty racist as if a generation chinese american somehow has a deeper connection to chinese culture than anyone else in the room by virtue of their race regardless of their interests they might think chinese culture is backwards there is no way of knowing unless you talk to them the part that really angers me is that when people start bringing out identity politics everyone wants to play the discourse inevitably degrades into base tribalism and hatred people who advocate this kind of mentality fail to realize that the identity politics of other races are the inevitable yin to their yang rather than seeing ourselves as one culture we start to see each other as groups looking out for ourselves and our own in a perfect world people would realize that there is no inherent difference between peoples that can be traced back to race any form of identity politics is actively working against egalitarianism which is the end goal as far as im concerned i know ive probably made you very frustrated and i hope none of this came off as snarky im going to give you final words as a show of good faith thank you for discussing this with me
television,not_removed,i mean youre wrong im white and have used that term many times and most people i know white and not have its not ignorance its just a lack of caring about something so silly that you seem to be hung up on
television,not_removed,lol no im not saying that white people are the only ones who have employed this strategy unless you think hierarchies only exist in white societies actually divide and conquer tactics are used even in subcultures by and against people of the same race
television,not_removed,lol literally laughed out loud not just the internet lol
television,not_removed,oh i definitely are comprehend it
television,not_removed,your so right rosa parks wasnt an individual so im totally ignoring that part you dont get to pretend that by saying individual you just mean the few that make bad arguments when its pretty clear that you would ignore an individual making good arguments about how racism impeded them hell even your example of getting power obama has said it because you can just tell yourself theyre just trying to play the black card i mean actually trying to differentiate between valid complaints and invalid ones is just too much work its so much easier to just assume the poor are just lazy
television,not_removed,whats with the reverse insult
television,not_removed,dont forget about we asians when was the last time you saw an asian male lead in a movie that wasnt about martial arts honestly the only thing i can think of is john cho in harold and kumar
television,not_removed,to be fair most of the hispanics i grew up with just looked like white people with better tans so its a bit difficult to pin everyones race down all the time
television,not_removed,you guys got luis guzman and that one chick who plays the same stereotypical spanish bad ass in every film shes in
television,not_removed,actually hispanics make up more of the pop than blacks left handed people are a smaller population than both races everything is pretty much made with right handed people in mind the left handers need to rise up
television,not_removed,and we collectively get nowhere when you pit races against each other like this
television,not_removed,this we need more asian representation on tv cry the asian actors we need more black representation too wtf what about us hispanics that make up more of the us population
television,not_removed,to be fair hispanics are largely a separate community in the us altogether and most are spanishspeaking they have adequate representation in latino media its not really anyones fault since most us hispanics arent really looking to be represented in hollywood
television,not_removed,movies like better luck tomorrow gain massive cult followings just because its one of the few halfdecent pieces of american cinema that asianamericans can cling to same with fresh off the boat ive never seen a tv show gain that quick of a following among asianamericans particularly chinese it helps that the show nails almost all of the cultural references but its also the fubu mentality asianamericans just dont often get to see modern media with asian leads thats culturally accurate due to being at least partially made by asians
television,not_removed,black panther better be one of the biggest superhero movies of all time or else people need to stop complaining about wanting more minority leads same with wonder woman and female leads gotta love that plenty of movies flop with white male leadscasts and they continue to get made but the rest of us only get one shot lol
television,not_removed,of course they dont
television,not_removed,you made a horribly inaccurate statement now you are grasping at straws you make no sense
television,not_removed,its reddit people always bring up bet but dont bring up cmt freeform
television,not_removed,he is very intelligent and his phrasing was meant for those without your sort of political correctness his words for bigotry is not the real issue running off to fight some culture war tangent is what those who rule this country want us to do as we waste our energy on nonsense rather that fight for our fare share
television,not_removed,no hard feelings at all i disagree with you on some things but im glad we could exchange views without hostility
television,not_removed,i mean youre wrong im white and have used that term many times and most people i know white and not have well i guess if you used it then any random guy would use it for sure
television,not_removed,it took fucking aziz ansari to make a show about an indian guy that didnt revolve around tenk you come again its really just incredible how people forget that black people are freaking privileged in the media compared to every other minority
television,not_removed,slumdog millionaire and life of pi
television,not_removed,yeah basically glenn from the walking dead is the most stereotype breaking role in films the only asian characters are designed to cater to chinese markets at foreign box office at this point the trope of secret chinese project they reveal to help americans is getting out of fucking hand
television,not_removed,probably because many hispanics are white hispanic isnt a race
television,not_removed,michelle rodriguez
television,not_removed,to be fair hispanics are largely a separate community in the us altogether where the fuck do you get this as with any other minority there are predominantly hispanic communities throughout the country but no
television,not_removed,no studio is going to greenlight more than one hundred million dollar blockbuster starting a black person that isnt will smith or idris elba unless one releases and makes bank thats the way it is tough shit
television,not_removed,my statement was about entertainment not just tv its right there a couple posts up
television,not_removed,okay mrs perry thanks
television,not_removed,im guessing hispanics dont complain about misrepresentation as much
television,not_removed,lol im aware of the state of the movie industry hun its the logic behind it that makes no sense
television,not_removed,yes you had to move the goal posts a bit to prove your point
television,not_removed,i am not a fan of his movies but i can recognize his success
television,not_removed,oh i agree its stupid
television,not_removed,this is now the second time youve argued against something i didnt say
television,not_removed,i watched it pretty much exactly like last season for mostly better or worse all the episodes seem to have enough charm in the end to keep you going
television,not_removed,i watched the whole first season and was generally happy with it this first episode blew me away this is what i was waiting decades for the tempo the dialog the actual horror and most of all the real ash not the trainingwheels version we got in season i am way more excited about season now
television,not_removed,watched it live on fb it was pretty good and i thought using the fb live feature that way was interesting in terms of promotion
television,not_removed,good the first season was delicious i will return to this restaurant
television,not_removed,he was ash from the very first second he was on screen and at no point did he seem watered down hell the entire ending of the first season was the most perfect ash moment in the entire franchise
television,not_removed,mmmmmmmm dont agree i saw bruce campbell for most of the first season that goes a very long way because bruce campbell but the ash thats in the evil dead series wasnt quite there that ash well hail to the king baby
television,not_removed,dont be so sour
television,not_removed,mmmmmmmm dont agree bruce was ash from episode one i dont get what you mean by wasnt quite there he was comical and badass since
television,not_removed,i think hes being a little bitter myself
television,not_removed,ok
television,not_removed,i like your rebuttal
television,not_removed,no need you have won the internet
television,not_removed,made a pretty big splash when it first appeared
television,not_removed,theres an odd feeling of freedom to this show theres suspense but also levity it made me happy
television,not_removed,its just a soap opera with telepathy
television,not_removed,is one of the best shows ive seen in a very long time lots of stuff going on there are main characters plus all their friends but it all ties together just beautifully well scripted well acted amazing cinematography and a great balance of action characterization humor and even a bit of song and dance in there as well just watch it and enjoy
television,not_removed,such potential terrible disappointment it just feels like its the wachowskis platform for venting about every social injustice in todays world
television,not_removed,i think that show is really the leftovers is good but the leftovers blows it out of the water
television,not_removed,i personally have never been a fan of the show
television,not_removed,for me hands down the second worst show netflix has done outside of the oa self indulgent garbage
television,not_removed,when the first season came out all the reviews said it was wank but now every time i hear it brought up people say its great i dunno who to believe anymore
television,not_removed,i watched the first couple of episodes and somehow never managed to understand enough of what was going on to finish it it just left me confused
television,not_removed,it is imaginative and connective
television,not_removed,it is just gratuitous no
television,not_removed,definitely not the best show i have ever seen but it is really great for what it is also it really plays out like a lot of anime dont know what that means you would probably thoroughly enjoy the anime kiznaiver that being said i am definitely looking forward to the coming season
television,not_removed,id been wondering if this show is worth getting into but is it similar to mr robot that show could also be described the same way wasnt a huge fan of it anyway i will give it a shot
television,not_removed,is great
television,not_removed,in the form of a bellyflop
television,not_removed,no me either i tried watching it a few times based on how much people love it here but it never stuck
television,not_removed,oh god the oa was so so bad selfindulgent is the perfect way of describing it i just zoned out before the first episode ended
television,not_removed,someone has not seen hemlock grove now that was real garbage of a show
television,not_removed,naw there is a lot more netflix stuff that is worse
television,not_removed,it takes a bit to get going and has some stuff early on that pushes some audiences away if youre up for the ride its worth riding
television,not_removed,i thought it was wank too at first and i kinda still do but its really enjoyable wank
television,not_removed,what reviews ones i read had high ratings even on imdb it has a average of e episode for user ranked reviews
television,not_removed,the reviews were mixed at worst and that was only really of the first few episodes around episode or something it steps up a notch
television,not_removed,reviewers generally only get a few episodes when a new show is released and seeing as many binge shows these days are just as much designed as novels as they are as tv shows the reviews can often be off
television,not_removed,just rewatch it and stay focused while watching because everything matters its like a big puzzle
television,not_removed,the show explores sexual freedom in an interesting way i guess it may be more than people are used to theres a similar show where the connected characters are angels if youd like that better
television,not_removed,relies more on the characters interactions with each other than mr robot where isolation is a major theme fsociety dont represent a cohesive unit so much as a task force of loners with a common goal brings a group of strangers together and shows how they come to rely on each other emotionally as well as physically worth a watch but dont expect a similar show
television,not_removed,i thought it was more of a needlessly sloppy dildo flop
television,not_removed,if you want to really see how bad it got just watch a youtube clip of the last minutes just dont have liquid in your mouth or you may spit laugh your pc
television,not_removed,agreed saw it but drank away the memories with apparent success still think and the oa edge it out for worst at least hemlock grove had one redeeming quality famke janssen
television,not_removed,if the climax of doesnt get you nothing will
television,not_removed,end of the first episode or the ending of the season i feel i should watch this i love terrible tv show endings ever since someone showed me the end of the us life on mars show
television,not_removed,end of the season id wear a neck brace as you may cringe so hard you snap your neck
television,not_removed,of course youd cringe at it because there is no context i liked the oa and the whole season was a pretty cool interesting journey which builds up after each episode leading to the finale i guess like most shows huh
television,not_removed,in my opinion almost every show ive seen builds up far better than this hippy dippy self indulgent drivel did youre entitled to your opinion as are all those of us who hated this mess
television,not_removed,well thats deflating
television,not_removed,karmas a bitch httpswwwgooglecomauampuproxxcommediathebiggestlosercontestantsunsafeweightlossabuseamp
television,not_removed,just cancelled my gym membership
television,not_removed,steroids
television,not_removed,if we only knew of a diet capable of reversing heart disease
television,not_removed,working out genetics
television,not_removed,that is what happened to zyzz rip
television,not_removed,the world is often a mediocre place before you add girls panties to the mix wait
television,not_removed,this is comedy gold thanks for showing this
television,not_removed,almost exactly a minute after atthewsw posted it to rfunny you post it to rtelevision something is afoot edit and it seems your comments are stolen from other comments why even do that
television,not_removed,that really shows some of those jokes are forced as fuck
television,not_removed,apparantly whichever actor showed up first on the job that day got to make the jokes
television,not_removed,you can freeze yourself and make sure someone gets you at the end of january when it airs on bbc america just dont freeze yourself too long and end up dealing with sea otters
television,not_removed,yarr
television,not_removed,yarr
television,not_removed,ahoy
television,not_removed,nope working for me in dallas on
television,not_removed,ae cancelled longmire and netflix picked it up and made at least more seasons so in that regard it is now a netflix original
television,not_removed,a show gets labeled a netflix original if netflix has the exclusive rights in that country to broadcast the show theres three basic versions of this shows completely produced by netflix shows that were canceled by their home country and netflix picked up the rights and produced more seasons exclusively for netflix like arrested development shows that continued to air and be produced in their home country but were canceled from airing in other countries netflix picks up the rights to distribute these shows in other countries but has absolutely no hand in actually making the shows
television,not_removed,syfy calls shows they buy and rebroadcast without making more like lost girl syfy originals so i think its just a pr thing
television,not_removed,netlfix original is a term they made up for any show that is currently airing only on netflix as in netflix paid the money for the show and has exclusive rights to it its not a perfect name to definition but its not meant to be its a marketing slogan
television,not_removed,the other channel cancelled it seasons and were produced by netflix
television,not_removed,goddammit ricky
television,not_removed,as already stated they give that tag to show of which they own they exclusive rights in a given country for example better call saul is marketed as netflix original here in italy though of course they have no say whatsoever on the production side of it
television,not_removed,if you see netflix original you know that netflix now own and produce it even if it was purchased from another company the new episodes are definitely netflix original i guess they would need to come up with something else catchy if they were going to brand things that theyve purchased netflix but not call it a netflix original
television,not_removed,because they can
television,not_removed,not at all the case netflix originals can either be things commissioned by them or shows that they have exclusive rights in a particular country peaky blinders is a tiger aspect production for the bbc but netflix markets it as an original in the us as they have the firstrun rights there
television,not_removed,interesting i didnt know that one
television,not_removed,theres also lots of shows currently airing on tv in the us that are netflix originals in other countries where netflix has exclusive rights to the show
television,not_removed,indeed
television,not_removed,god i miss seeing the adventures of jack sam daniel tealc jonas cameron vala rodney john ronon tayla jack saying nintendos instead of neutrinos the groundhog day episode jack busting baals balls thor sams stupid idea that saved the asgardian homeworld episode episode rodneys phobias john addressing ronon as chewie the siege of atlantis on and on and on
television,not_removed,they missed the lines that go across the glyphs and the little pieces that go along the tops of each chevron but those are minor things i would love to see it in person while everyone else was fawning over star trek and star wars my first real television love was stargate
television,not_removed,the stargate was made by printing house vigo universal and it was no easy feat it took them hours to print separate parts and then assemble them the model was made for the museums new exhibit which has been running since may and will continue until november while many exhibitions have explored the reasons for the fascination with ancient egypt on the general public few are those related to the geek universe they stop frequently to the with the movie cleopatra joseph l mankiewicz starring elizabeth taylor and richard burton yet egyptian gods and science fiction have been regularly involved in the last forty years the exhibition will propose to address and further develop this inspiration in recent years through film stargate the mummy returns immortal ad vitam or the highly anticipated xmen apocalypse but also through comics thor batman mighty isis wonder woman the avengers apocalypse shazam fantastic so many characters of dc comics franchises marvel also vertigo or through video games retrogaming board games and role playing games age of mythology pathfinder deus
television,not_removed,i miss stargate i wish we had an era where there was a episode a year stargate again i dont even care for most shows nowadays
television,not_removed,i assume enki bilal will be in the exhibit at least the original comic verison of it
television,not_removed,needs an
television,not_removed,is gods of egypt technically science fiction or just straight fantasy because as much as that movie bombed id love to see some recreated props from it there should definitely be something apocalypserelated in there wonder what else theyve got
television,not_removed,i need this also i want more stargate
television,not_removed,digital trends story project page httpswwwkisskissbankbankcomenprojectsdestargateauxcomics
television,not_removed,sorry but what a crap shot of the final product we just see the top half how about a full view of the setup
television,not_removed,httpiimgurcompzovwgif
television,not_removed,you blow up one sun and suddenly everyone expects you to walk on water
television,not_removed,the golf shot was my favourite ever moment
television,not_removed,we had bsg then too man what a time for scifi that was
television,not_removed,yes enough close ups just one steady midrange shot with the entire ring in view please
television,not_removed,i was going to mention this but could not quite remember how the quote went if you guys feel nostalgic theres a webpage called wwwgateworldnet with summaries of each and every episode of the show and its spinoffs
television,not_removed,that and tealc getting hit in the face with the door every reset
television,not_removed,bsg stargate multiple shows star trek multiple shows babylon farscape firefly andromeda the to was the heyday for scifi in space on television now we have almost none and the recent ones get cancelled ugh
television,not_removed,yes the setup was masterful i remember watching the episode and wondering why they didnt show how tealcs day would be when it reset and then they show it to you i was in tears laughing when it happened
television,not_removed,actually things are looking up the expanse has a new season coming soon after a great first season the writer and ep of stargate fourth season on atlantis and universe joseph malozzi has a show called dark matter in its second season its enjoyable and has a few stargate alum along with actors from lost girl and continuum i dont watch killjoys but its in its second season there is a new star trek series coming soon called discovery the long fabled live action star wars tv show is currently in talks at abc star wars rebels has a new season coming soon after a great second season did i miss anything edit a stargate reboot movie is supposedly in the works with plans for a trilogy if successful considering how the jump to tv went last time i doubt it will have anything to do with atlantis and universe if we get a new show but who knows red dwarfs eleventh season starts september they shot xi and xii back to back so the twelfth season is coming in
television,not_removed,that infographic muddies the information if anything else
television,not_removed,now he can trade in snow for targaryen
television,not_removed,he can trade in snow for waters since he is still a bastard
television,not_removed,targaryens practiced polygamy the kingsguard were at the tower protecting an heir
television,not_removed,well he is the king now so he can legitimise himself i assume and then he can be stark or targaryen probably best to chose stark though if he doesnt want the iron throne would avoid antagonising the south
television,not_removed,wouldnt it be sand since the tower of joy is in dorne
television,not_removed,the tower of joy is not near the crownlands waters isnt an option
television,not_removed,they renounced the practice at least years ago under pressure from the faith
television,not_removed,this thing still says abducted though i agree that the whole abduction thing was probably overblown and she and rhaegar probably got married until someone tells me for sure they might be misleading us plus while im a targaryen i do what i want might have worked for the three hundred years they had the throne im betting my dad was a polygamist so ive got a legal right to the throne might not go over super well with the average person course none of it matters stark or targaryen snow or waters hes confirmed to have both the blood of ice and fire running through his veins and considering its called a song of ice and fire thats probably more important than the name
television,not_removed,no one knows if they got married
television,not_removed,has more to do with where they are raised not born
television,not_removed,its about blood not geography going by your logic why was jons last name snow in the first place he would have had to been born in the north for his name to be snow right except he wasnt everyone knows eddard stark returned from the war down south with a baby he named jon snow a bastards last name comes from their parents not the location of their birth otherwise jons last name would have never been snow
television,not_removed,rheagar chose love over faith
television,not_removed,but did they renounce it officially or just stop marrying more then person
television,not_removed,not sure how much abducting took place after the prince and heir names her the most beautiful at the tournament
television,not_removed,the kingsguard dont protect rape victims or mistresses
television,not_removed,it has more to do with where they are raised roberts bastards didnt share a last name jon was raised in the north its snow if hes a bastard targaryen if hes not
television,not_removed,ser arthur dayne was rhaegars best friend and would probably protect whoever rhaegar asked him to
television,not_removed,the sword of the morning and rheagar both had honor rheagars last word was lyanna
television,not_removed,i know rhaegar loved lyanna and she probably loved him but we still dont know if they were actually married everyone can make assumptions but we still dont know for sure hopefully george gives us the answer in the next book
television,not_removed,got
television,not_removed,pick an hbo show deadwood true detective sopranos the wire etc otherwise almost every show down to the simpsons kills central characters off from time to time nowadays
television,not_removed,spooks or isnt afraid to off a character now and then
television,not_removed,chicago code which got cancelled had the best character death ive ever seen in television he wasnt a central character yet but he was in that episode it was incredibly jarring
television,not_removed,dark matter
television,not_removed,thank you for your submission unfortunately your submission has been removed for the following reasons you might want to check out our
television,not_removed,the best answer to this question
television,not_removed,homer bart lisa etc has died
television,not_removed,up for several hours many replies hmmm lets take it down
television,not_removed,the length of time it stayed up and the number of replies doesnt change the fact that it violated our rules we have the recommendations thread for a reason
television,not_removed,so what youre saying is the simpsons arent central to the simpsons
television,not_removed,and thats when i realized the pancakes couldnt kill me because i was already dead
television,not_removed,this show is the hardest ive laughed since arrested development it will be missed
television,not_removed,there all is aching always
television,not_removed,thats honestly one of the most depressing series finales ive ever seen comedy or otherwise holy shit
television,not_removed,i can think of few shows as uniformly excellent as review not a single weak spot its unfortunate that it didnt get the audience it deserved but im glad they were able to give the show such cruel closure even having a cameo from the creatorstar of the original australian show everybody involved with the making of this show deserves nothing but success in their careers
television,not_removed,what i dont get is why renew it for only episodes i cant complain too much since i didnt think thered even be a new season but still
television,not_removed,damn only episodes that is an abrupt end i think i can already guess what the last review entails
television,not_removed,come discuss the finale and the show over at rfivestars
television,not_removed,aw what i just got into this show a week or so ago and have been binging like crazy saw that a season is currently airing so got pretty excited for even after i finish watching through theres nothing worse than having a season end way shorter than you expected
television,not_removed,check out the original review with myles barlow most of it is on youtube it is on netflix in a few regions too
television,not_removed,the pancakedivorce episode was one of the funniest episodes of tv ever also the gloryhole one was dropdead on the floor funny
television,not_removed,talk about a perfect finale for the show and for forrest so well done i think we all know what the easy way out would have been but instead they somehow found something even more sad and messed up glad they came back to give us the ending they wanted to it may have been a short season but damn was it good
television,not_removed,five stars five mfing stars
television,not_removed,just watched it and immediately came here to post i somehow missed the news this season would only be three episodes long so it was kind of punch in the gut damn ill miss it pancakesdivorce will go down as one of the all time great half hours of comedy television i dont think ive laughed that hard since it aired ill miss you forrest macneil and aj who provided some of the best moments in the show
television,not_removed,having just watched the finale i still dont know how to process it im shook
television,not_removed,what a kick in the gut
television,not_removed,what a brilliant show im almost happy it ended because even though its over it died in its prime it was a start to finish andy daly is a genius hopefully we get a second season of the andy daly podcast pilot project now
television,not_removed,am i the only one that thinks this is just a marketing stunt and there will be more episodes because it is canon in the show that review is cancelled
television,not_removed,that was a weird ending
television,not_removed,im going to miss the shit out of this show one of the funniest things i have ever seen is the episode when forest went to space i think they ended the show very fittingly
television,not_removed,after reading this i think ill give the show a try
television,not_removed,never heard of this where can i watch
television,not_removed,which show
television,not_removed,if it was so great why did it get cancelled might have to check it out edit i didnt mean this in a condescending way i was seriously asking
television,not_removed,what is this show and where can i find snippets of it this sounds suspiciously like an australian show from a few years back called review with myles barlow
television,not_removed,try nathan for you if you havent already watched it
television,not_removed,if you havent already try a canadian show called letterkenny watching season now and i highly recommend it
television,not_removed,to give it a proper ending
television,not_removed,i was in serious denial that the show had only gotten a episode season which made the finale so much funnier as it sank in
television,not_removed,i dont fully understand why it was cancelled in the first place was it really cause of low ratings i cant imagine any comedy fan would watch that show and not like it plus its a tv comedy that puts funny first no super emotional relationships or sideplots or detailed character development just funny rewatchable laugh out loud absurdist humor i really cant imagine why it wouldve had low ratings enough to be cancelled but im grateful to have amazing seasons and this is a show ill constantly come back to for solid laughs i have a feeling itll be one of those niche shows with a handful of dedicated fans that never tire of rewatching episodes
television,not_removed,am i the only one that thinks this is just a marketing stunt and there will be more episodes because it is canon in the show that review is cancelled
television,not_removed,youd be surprised
television,not_removed,i thought so too prepare to be very confused
television,not_removed,i feel like this is fake news
television,not_removed,pancakes divorce more pancakes is a comedy episode legend never gets old gonna miss this show
television,not_removed,fucking dieter brummer
television,not_removed,the original guy had a cameo in this last episode too which was a nice touch
television,not_removed,sadly havent been able to find season anywhere
television,not_removed,not saying they couldnt but has any shoes ever done this before
television,not_removed,i dont think its really over
television,not_removed,you should one of my favorite shows of all time
television,not_removed,on comedy centrals app is the only official place aside from on television ccs app is pretty shitty though and youll need a cable provider login aside from those youll be able to buy it tomorrow from various online stores as usual best bet is to just use illegal streamingtorrent sites for the easiest way of checking it out sadly shame it isnt more available anymore because it is a great show
television,not_removed,get to pancakes divorce pancakes and report back as to if this isnt one of the greatest shows ever
television,not_removed,watch the original australian version first review with myles barlow heres a link
television,not_removed,why do ncis and big bang theory have the best ratings on television why did trump get elected ratings rarely coincide with quality sadly
television,not_removed,yeah american remake of it they did that for a bit with the slap and rake too
television,not_removed,i like that show too but its not really the same nfy is more cringeawkwarddry humor and its not very overt its a lot of subtext funny for sure but more cerebral review is more like mouthagape i did not see that coming type of humor its more my style because its just so absurd yet its also believable for example its unlikely that anyone would remain on their knees waddling away from a fire as their parents home burns to the ground yet forests character makes it seem plausible and it shows how far that show pushed the boundaries of realistic yet absurd thats the kind of humor im gonna miss and you just dont really find that in many other shows two other good examples of absurdbutbelievable are arrested iasip but there just arent many that do it right
television,not_removed,actually picked it up when i was looking for my review fix a while back
television,not_removed,i love their youtube series so much i cant find that show online anywhere though
television,not_removed,letterkenny starts out strong but really falls off the show peaks in the first few episodes the later half of the first season isnt as funny as the first half season is nowhere close to the same level it began to almost feel like a chore to finish watching it they just seemed to lose what made it good to begin with
television,not_removed,yup from what i understand a few execspeople at comedy central were huge fans of the show and just pushed really hard to let them finish it the way they wanted to
television,not_removed,a show can be good and still have low ratings it can depend on all sort of things including bad advertising a bad timeslot or a show being kinda niche review had a very specific sense of humor that may not have been everyones cup of tea
television,not_removed,did you see the ending
television,not_removed,theyre on hulu
television,not_removed,every now and then its on abc iview if you are australian
television,not_removed,a happy ending i dont know if youve been watching the same show i have
television,not_removed,huh i always compare nathan and review simply because review manages to feel as real to me as nathan and they both get me to the point of nearly having to pause it to continue both are watching someone just do the absolutely wrong thing when its so obvious what the right thing is but youre powerless to stop it arrested sunny nathan and review are my top comedies
television,not_removed,i never said theyre the same
television,not_removed,yeah admittedly i had to steal it for that reason
television,not_removed,that makes me happy its the not the kind of thing you hear about enough in show business specifically tv
television,not_removed,perhaps i simply understood from the darkest corner of my soul that these pancakes couldnt kill me because i was already dead
television,not_removed,i guess when someone says tv show xx is so funny with a response try watching nfy my assumption is that youre recommending nfy based on the initial commenters preferences otherwise its just a random suggestion for a funny tv show thats unrelated to the original comment apologies if i inferred more from your suggestion than you meant either way theyre all great shows and well worth watching
television,not_removed,semantics i guess but i said theyre not the same however ive realized that people who like nathan for you tend to like review that is why i made the suggestion
television,not_removed,vera and freddie have some insane dialogue and they each pay attention to so much detail of the characters like the latest season is insane for how much norman has impersonated norma her quirky phrases her hand motions excuses and frikkin everything its really well done imo gj to both
television,not_removed,watched seasons on netflix recently when i started i thought it was gonna be one of those mindless watches that just pass the time but boy was i wrong the characters in this series are just so deep and freddie highmores performance was damn near perfect i can only imagine how difficult it must be to play a character thats so fucked up but still so innocent at the same time but he sure pulled it off i highly recommend this series to anyone whos currently between shows
television,not_removed,freddie highmore is so amazing in bates excited to see what he does next now that its coming to an end
television,not_removed,he plays a good creeper
television,not_removed,damn that was creepy maybe i should watch the show i love how ludicrously posh freddie is irl too
television,not_removed,i would like to watch this show but i really just dont get how anyone can believe this kid kills people hes what a lbs soaking wet in overalls
television,not_removed,yeah vera is fantastic as well sometimes the show can be a bit on the pulpy side but both these actors elevate the material to something special
television,not_removed,its so sad to see norman just spiral out of control into insanity especially considering how normal and nice he was at the beginning its kind of a story about neglectance and not getting the care he needs he cant help himself which makes him an incredibly sympathetic guy
television,not_removed,so who is the killer pm if you must
television,not_removed,without spoiling much he doesnt have many confirmed kills and the ones he does have are either the element of surprise or people he would have been able to overpower plus you know seeing the kid from charlie and the chocolate factory in a blonde wig would be enough to throw just about anyone off
television,not_removed,couldnt have said it better myself
television,not_removed,bob
television,not_removed,easily the best show going right now
television,not_removed,man if this is happening here id hate to think of whats happening in euro westworld
television,not_removed,i want to know what happened to the guest that was hunting wyatt with teddy two episodes ago havent seen or heard anything from her since she was fleeing on her own into the night
television,not_removed,using clair de lune during the bar scene struck me and i read the poem that debussy used to create the piece and its really interesting in relation to the show your soul is like a landscape fantasy where masks and bergamasks in charming wise strum lutes and dance just a bit sad to be hidden beneath their fanciful disguise singing in minor mode of lifes largesse and allvictorious love they yet seem quite reluctant to believe their happiness and their song mingles with the pale moonlight the still moonlight sad and beautiful sets the birds softly dreaming in the trees and makes the marbled fountains gushing streaming slender jetfountains—sob their ecstasie
television,not_removed,i was more excited for this than twd last night
television,not_removed,each episode is better than the last how is this possible
television,not_removed,buckle up dolores cause kansas is going buhbye
television,not_removed,maybe i watch too much porn but i found the orgy scenes pretty pedestrian
television,not_removed,that episode had a nice rendition of a nine inch nails track something i can never have the lyrics for the song ring true in places for the show you always were the one to show me how back then i couldnt do the things that i can do now this thing is slowly take me apart grey would be the color if i had a heart come on and tell me you make this all go away you make this all go away im down to just one thing and im starting to scare myself you make this all go away you make this all go away i just want something i just want something i can never have in this place it seems like such a shame though it all looks different now i know its still the same everywhere i look youre all i see just a fading fucking reminder of who i used to be
television,not_removed,you know the show has good writing when youre more sexually attracted to the main character when she pulls out a gun and shoots people dead than when you saw her fully naked earlier in the same episode
television,not_removed,dolores reminded me of this episode cant wait to find out what maeve says next week
television,not_removed,calling it now all the people in the command center are actually robots with set routines arnold is still alive and is running the park from the outside delores becoming self aware is part of the larger storyline the old man in charge is trying to stop her from becoming self aware because clearly hes the villainous puppet master but the older black dude is trying to push her along attempting to be the good guy
television,not_removed,bernard low is an anagram for arnold weber mind blown bernard is a robot confirmed
television,not_removed,i still like the show but doesnt have me obsessed like that first season of lost then again that one unraveled pretty poorly in the end they made a special point to acknowledge there are no photos of arnold so if thats the case is this a situation where weve already seenmet him as an audience hate that device but curious
television,not_removed,episode ive fallen asleep in im starting to get tired of minutes of nothing and then a final minutes of reveal maybe next week ill just skip and start from there
television,not_removed,can someone please explain why this show is great i am genuinely curious it has been the most boring of shows to me i love western and i love sci fi for example jonah hex the comics not the stupid movie this show has left me feeling empty and scratching my head with boredom it has great actors visually interesting interesting premise westwood has been a over stuffed with big name actors what the plot is about i have no clue just a series of incidents the best new show for me has been dirk gently it is hilarious highly confusing i have no clue what to expect from a truly bizarre in the best sense of the word original tv show
television,not_removed,starting to lose interest i wouldve preferred a different show focusing on new people coming into the park each week perhaps just find it a bit of a boring storyline
television,not_removed,with only episodes in and something like black mirror having just released a new season i really think thats a bit of a stretch edit lol you cant even make the subtlest negative comment about this show so ill go all out and just say it sucks they got some nice visuals and cool worldbuilding but the dialogue is awful and theres no main character liam mcpoyle is the closest to a protagonist but hes barely in most of the episodes sans this most recent one im not gonna have an emotional connection to a robot because its literally a robot programmed to do whatever its no data or johnny five also its full of plot holes also this show just sucks in general and i think people only like it cause hbo and it looks pretty edit this has actually gone up in points since i made the first edit lol
television,not_removed,it really bugged me that she looked so familiar turns out she was bianca from shameless shes only credited for episode
television,not_removed,i really couldnt care less for the torture porn episodes of twd
television,not_removed,i was too at first and watched westworld as it aired then watched twd a little later and it was surprisingly good new character nothing too tacky or dramatic save for the new character i was pleasantly surprised but with twd there is always a huge cliff drop after the season premiere maybe one or two episodes in filler episodes i have faith in the writers but im not holding my breath but i too thought last nights episode was going to begin the filler episode barrage but was pleasantly surprised maybe next week
television,not_removed,good writing excellent everything else too but the writing is what pushes you forward
television,not_removed,if you have watched person of interest this wouldnt be anything new to you edit the writer for this series jonathan wrote the story for person of interest most of you might not like the first season but im telling you it is worth the watch that show was also centered around artificial intelligence
television,not_removed,buckle up buckaroos
television,not_removed,it was on par with eyes wide shut in my opinion and that one was known for being so graphic that it was heavily censored in all american releases of the movie i think porn has gone a long way since eyes wide shut though and nothing but straight up sex on camera will make people go oh shit thats a party anymore
television,not_removed,i found it be pointless i wanted the show to get on with the characters then look at a bunch of humping
television,not_removed,the hosts being naked is supposed to dehumanize them so i suppose its working
television,not_removed,i miss firefly even to this day
television,not_removed,i miss firefly even to this day
television,not_removed,i think the man in black is the robot version of arnold
television,not_removed,the man in black is arnold theres not a man in the world who would take the tone with me you do in a past life perhaps
television,not_removed,ford still keeps a photo on his desk that few people know about right
television,not_removed,i doubt any show will handle mystery suspense and cliffhangers as well as lost did while the show has some major issues it was masterful at hooking the audience in the mysteries didnt ford show us a picture of him and arnold i believe it was even recapped in the previously on segment last week
television,not_removed,i think this show couldve benefited from a more lostlike first season where its simple stories like the water bottle mystery in the first eps of lost with a few bigger mystery hints building up until the second season westworld is piling up the complex mysteries and questions too quickly imo i wouldve liked to see a few worldbuilding simpler narratives in these first episodes
television,not_removed,the man in black is arnold theres not a man in the world who would take the tone with me you do in a past life perhaps
television,not_removed,so much happened this entire episode what do you mean you arent paying attention to the details
television,not_removed,do you have narcolepsy or something
television,not_removed,i fell asleep the first two episodes then i went back and rewatched them and am now a fan i guess it could be considered slow but i prefer slow paced shows
television,not_removed,dont agree with you but upvoting because diff opinions are welcome
television,not_removed,its definitely a show that needs to be watched in sitting and not looking at your phone or something or you could miss things about the plot there is a lot going on but if you arent paying attention i could see how it is boring the little changes leading up to things is what is exciting they are usually more important than the action scenes
television,not_removed,if you are really finding that this show is just a series of incidents without any connection then you either need to pay closer attention or come back in a year and binge the whole season at once were in the leadup phase right now the pieces are all bitbybit coming together in a way that is ultimately going to produce a calamity if this was jurassic park were kind of just beyond that point where hammond brings his guests in but not yet at the point where everything goes to hell most seasons of game of thrones actually have a similar story structure lots of episodes where pieces are maneuvered into place followed by an explosion as we see the result of those maneuvers this is good storytelling but its a style that requires more of viewers than some shows might
television,not_removed,its more about tastes tbh i tried to watch also dirk and was indeed intriguing for the mins or so after which i found it irritating the least the awkwardness of the situations depicted in the show felt like synthetic and unrealistic
television,not_removed,so youd want a procedural hell they could put it right after ncis new orleans on cbs i kid of course but thatd get real old after a couple episodes
television,not_removed,you must be new here rule if a new show doesnt have a shit pilot it is literally the best show that no one is watching right and deserves threads a day to remind you that literally no one is watching it that being said westworld has been interesting so far and as far as dramas go especially on sunday nights it is the most interesting one to me
television,not_removed,no idea why you got downvoted so hard haha reddit is stupid sometimes just having finished season of black mirror is affecting me too because westworld hasnt reached bm levels of interesting yet
television,not_removed,noooooo oh well maybe next season
television,not_removed,kinda rude to downvote since hes actually right except for season one every season on every new episode is better than the previous one
television,not_removed,a huge part of the show is the idea that if we had no consequences we would revert to purely pleasure seeking beings so in that sense the orgyviolent scenes are vital to what the show is trying to say
television,not_removed,got himself a robot body when he died
television,not_removed,bernard low is an anagram of arnold weberso idk about that
television,not_removed,its really easy to create compelling mystery if you have no intention of explaining it i enjoyed lost but it was pretty obvious they had no real game plan and most of the revelations were a terrible let down i read stories about the writers just coming up with the most insane stuff because it didnt really matter it was an enjoyable journey but ultimately a failure as a show about mysteries the thing i like about nolan is that all of his stories lead to something building from one moment to the next and feel satisfying that means a slower more methodical build up because you actually need to keep track of the pieces in play and make sure they all work together
television,not_removed,except he says he was the one who stopped arnold from destroying westworld so that makes no sense at all
television,not_removed,hes a super powerful business man this is hinted at when another person goes to thank him for his company saving his sister i forget and he gets pissed and tells him hell kill him because he is on vacation that quote you mentioned is specifically referencing that everyone sucks up to him in the real world because of who he is
television,not_removed,seriously i think a lot of these people complaining about being bored need to go back to transformers there are a lot of important details being dropped in every scene
television,not_removed,i like how someone downvoted you for welcoming different opinions i enjoy the show but this is honestly starting to feel a bit cultish
television,not_removed,yep the devil is in the details definitely e good show compared to the new ones this fall
television,not_removed,oh no you didnt you didnt compare this piece of to game of thrones game of thrones hooked me from the first scene the gates going up and the riders emerging i have a lot of patience with tv shows since they are made by people with a lot more talent and imagination than me it took me ages and lot of repeated viewings to like the first season of breaking bad and rectify maybe it will change my mind but i dont think it belongs in same sentence as game of thrones or the twilight zone what i was looking for was some insight or moment of realization when a light bulb goes on and you realize you are watching a work of art right now it feels like a chore to watch i am always willing to change my mind if someone points out something i am missing
television,not_removed,no i wouldnt want a procedural just something that focused more on how they park operated how people came why when the customers themselves would still want an ongoing narrative just find the current storyline a bit dull
television,not_removed,me too westworld is very dissapointing im quite confused why everyone still likes it looks like the hype hasnt worn off yet
television,not_removed,yes thank you people generally dont know about poi that show was one of a kind the first season was not that great but from season two onwards it was a sweet sweet ride still dont know why the downwote hate though
television,not_removed,im probably in the minority here but i never expected the mysteries to be solved jj abrams gave a really cool ted talk some years back about a box that he has he doesnt know whats in it and he will never open it a mystery is something in its own right not just a transitionary step to an answer advocates of lost tend to argue that you should watch for the characters not the mysteries i partially disagree the mysteries are what made the show a success along with excellent characters phenomenal music and direction unique writing and usuallygood acting i realize that there is some expectation that mysteries will be resolved but a major theme of lost was accepting things on faith the primary struggle between locke and jack was essentially this if youve ever seen a magic trick you enjoyed it for the mystery and excitement not for the expectation that the magician will explain how the trick is done at the end all that said i think they did explain everything more or less unless mystical forces isnt a good enough explanation for the existence of the smoke monster and the unusual properties of the island jacob etc to be fair there were hints of mysticism from the very beginning but i believe the showrunners promised at various points that everything would be given a plausible scientific explanation which is regrettable
television,not_removed,hes robot version of arnold
television,not_removed,in every scene
television,not_removed,i havent voted either way but i think any downvotes he got are because he didnt contribute to the discussion also he lacks selfawareness about why the parent comment was downvoted a dissenting opinion is not quality content automatically the parent comment says two things about the show its boring and content is packed into the last minutes only the first is subjective but he gives littletono support for his opinion does he think the characters arent good is the pacing bad does he not like the dialog there is lots of room to provide meaningful discussion here but his comment amounts to lol this show sucks its boring regarding his second point about the pacing of the plot thats just absurdly false the show usually does end with a reveal but there has been information packed into nearly every scene of every episode the arm implant for example was probably the biggest reveal of this episode and it came somewhere around the midway mark to be fair while i enjoy westworld i recognize it has faults and i love to see intelligent criticisms op just hasnt provided that tldr shitty troll comment got downvoted comment defending it for being a different opinion also downvoted due to complete lack of selfawareness
television,not_removed,plot twist original commenter downvoted me
television,not_removed,honestly dude it seems like your mind is already pretty made up but if youre looking for some explanation and insight into the show id check out httpwwwredditcomrwestworld and read some of the discussion threads i dont think there is really one lightbulb moment more like lots of little moments that add up
television,not_removed,i often replay because to me its the best one in the series
television,not_removed,i dont think the mysteries were central to the original vision of lost the ending suggests that and i understand not answering everything but comparing a narrative to a magicians trick is apples to oranges when we go to a magic show we want to be fooled the joy is in not knowing because that then makes it feel real when we read a story or watch a show or movie we do not want that because it does the opposite and makes it feel cheap and fake by the end of the story we want to understand the narrative and the mysteries presented to us or they have no weight an author is free to use any deus ex machina they want and spin any wild tale if they never intend to explain it and that cheapens the story in the case of lost they did explain a lot of the mysteries eventually but as an afterthought and in many cases well after it was clear they had changed directions multiple times the black smoke monster story is full of plot holes and contradicting elements for instance they did the best they could to reconcile all the things they showed in relation to the monster but it was clear they had no idea what the monster was when they created it
television,not_removed,the argument that the comments arent quality content or contributing to the discussion would probably hold a lot more weight if the highestvoted top level comment at this moment wasnt easily the best show going right now which is not only incredibly vague but doesnt even say anything about this specific episode also he lacks selfawareness about why the parent comment was downvoted that is not what selfawareness means the first is subjective but he gives littletono support for his opinion does he think the characters arent good is the pacing bad does he not like the dialog there is lots of room to provide meaningful discussion here but his comment amounts to lol this show sucks its boring if you completely ignore the second part of the comment sure its kind of silly to isolate sections like this when the support which we may disagree with is clearly the pacing issues referenced in the second part of the comment the show usually does end with a reveal but there has been information packed into nearly every scene of every episode this depends on how you define information and packed most of what westworld does is leave a trail of breadcrumbs a lot of the information it gives is intentionally vague so as to leave the viewers with more questions than answers such as the random mention of the man in black saving westworld with no further explanation the show is very much a slow burn and its easy to see how that wouldnt appeal to somebody shitty troll comment got downvoted a troll comment would mean that it was made in bad faith just by looking at the ops comment history theres nothing to suggest that was the case here
television,not_removed,dont check our that sub i was temporarily banned from there for my aggressive behaviour aggressive behaviour being criticizing the show in any capacity and causing the fanboys to downvotebrigade me to the point where the mods had to step in
television,not_removed,if my mind was made up i wouldnt come here and ask people to convince me to prove me otherwise or ask people for evidence why i should change my mind thanks for the westworld reference i am going to check it out my quest continues i still havent had someone reference a single scene moment or anything else remotely resembling evidence or why i should change my mind i hope to proved wrong it is always fun to challenge ones own self
television,not_removed,if then else is easily one of my favorites god mode second season finale is one of favourite too
television,not_removed,just to make sure i understand your argument youre saying that a relatable narrative requires stakes and unresolved or poorly resolved mysteries reduce the quality of the narrative by reducing the stakes if so thats a good argument and definitely a popular reaction to the show i think the critical analysis of the show depends on how the show managed expectations in other words did the show itself imply that it would resolve all of the mysteries or was it transparent in its use of mysteries as a vehicle to introduce arbitrary drama as an admittedly biased supporter of the show i would argue the latter but i think mine is the minority opinion its interesting that shows like lost come under scrutiny for not answering mysteries while other shows get away with unexplained fantastic elements shows like fringe and xfiles contain monsters of the week which are often left unexplained the audience just takes them for granted and moves on a classic example would be the powers of clyde bruckman in the xfiles episode clyde bruckmans final repose his powers are integral to the story and discussed at length but the audience never asks why does he have these powers i think the answer is that the mysteries in lost are a huge part of the original vision for the show the polar bear and smoke monster both appear extremely early in the show im curious why you suggest that the ending precludes mystery as a central part of the original vision of lost the best argument i can make in favor of lost is that our discussion is mirrored thematically in the show through its science versus faith dichotomy specifically jack and locke are contrasted from the beginning locke blindly accepts his destiny on the island and embraces the weirdness without question for a while whereas jack needs logical answers to everything and only cares about practical matters theres a reason the show starts and ends with jacks eyes he represents the viewers experience with the mysteries of the island he slowly learns through the show to embrace faith in the last episode of the show he blesses water in a cup for hurley to drink season jack would never have even agreed to do that much less come up with the plan jacks evolution invites the viewer to introspection i know this interpretation feels like a copout but i think the show is very selfaware of the importance of mysteries to the show im typing all this on mobile while bored at work so dont blame me if its incoherent
television,not_removed,thanks this is a good balance reply to my comment obviously the majority opinion in favor of the show influences the voting but i was responding more to the poster who claimed that it was downvoted because it was a different opinion at the very least if hes invested so little in the show that hes fallen asleep during two consecutive episodes his opinion is suspect also its important to note that this is a discussion forum a toplevel post mentioning how good the show is with no other content encourages other people to post positive things they like about the show a toplevel post with unguided and misleading criticism about the show encourages other similar comments i wont speak for anyone else but i dont care to read insults about the show if he had posted something like the show is filled more with teasers and questions than satisfying answers which leaves me detached from the characters and action and ultimately had led to a boring experience then the resulting discussion would have a chance at not being lol yeah this show sucks i do appreciate your reply and i agree the situation is more nuanced than i implied in my first comment i regret the troll accusation as well interesting correction about my misuse of selfawareness ill have to find a better word to describe what i mean maybe just situationalsocial awareness thanks
television,not_removed,if my mind was made up i wouldnt come here and ask people to convince me to prove me otherwise or ask people for evidence why i should change my mind no thats exactly what trolls like you do pretend to just ask questions about why a show is good because you personally never paid attention or in some cases never watched the show but feel the need to announce your uneducated opinion to the world pretending to just ask questions you are offering nothing in this thread and you shouldnt be surprised that in return you are receiving nothing your veiled dishonestly is also obvious and pretty pathetic your best bet at this point is to stop posting
television,not_removed,to some degree i get where youre coming from and to reiterate i enjoyed lost but i think it could have been much more satisfying as far as the comparison to xfiles i think thats where an important distinction occurs that separates it from lost the xfiles was rarely about why or how but if if its possible if its real if its true then what does it mean clyde bruckman is actually a perfect example of that lost conversely presented mysteries as an answer to the what and why why are we here why are these things happening why us what is this place here is the hatch if you can get it open it will help you understand the island and why youre hereexcept it really didnt that hatch became a metaphor for all the other mysteries that failed to lead to any satisfying conclusion they were included simply to move the characters around the plot driving the characters instead of the characters driving the plot at least in my opinion i agree that lost was about science vs faith and that definitely elevated the material to some degree but they were basically throwing crazy things in so that the characters could have something to disagree on in that regard i do appreciate the different view and discussion though but i should probably get back to doing work myself
television,not_removed,thanks for attacking me because i disagree with your opinion made me agree with you i asked for a moment a bit of dialogue a point of discussion i humbly apologize for having disagreed with your holiness
television,not_removed,check out bobs burgers on fox pretty funny great characters
television,not_removed,over the garden wall and voltron are both really good shows and the latter is on netflix i also recommend total drama island
television,not_removed,how far do you want to go back king of the hill is a good show what about superheroes batman the animated series batman beyond justice leaguejustice league unlimited xmen the animated series first seasons young justice the tick hbos spawn samurai jack reboot beast wars
television,not_removed,steven universe
television,not_removed,
television,not_removed,• over the garden wall • bojack horseman • steven universe
television,not_removed,adventure time is a favorite of mine
television,not_removed,invader zim has always stuck with me but i cant be friends with someone who doesnt like futurama watch luck of the fryesh and try not to get feels i dare you
television,not_removed,cartoons that arent just comedy like south parkfamily guybugs bunny and have continuity the absolute best two shows are avatar the last airbender which youve already seen and i suppose you can watch korra too but whatever and gargoyles so gargoyles is your answer after that youre already taking a big step down netflixs trollhunters might have already jumped to the top of the next list but we really need to see how season shakes out after that its all superheroes avengers earths mightiest heroes or at least the first season and a bit and spectacular spiderman were good because of their continuity the dcau has less but still some and carries from batman the animated series to superman the animated series to justice league to the best of the bunch justice league unlimited and i suppose batman beyond is part of the dcau technically and theres also the sorta continuity of xmen spiderman gi joe and transformers comedynotcontinuity wise animaniacs tick and freakazoid are your best bets
television,not_removed,youve seen some great ones have you seen legend of korra you must watch it if youve seen avatar i loved both if youre into superhero at all young justice is amazing even for noncomic book fans the show has very well written characters and plots honestly adventure time is my favorite and i dont think you can just watch a few random episodes and fully enjoy it that show builds upon its universe wonderfully and touches on many serious topics while still being fun at times the show captures many emotions and gives me a sense of joy that i dont feel with many shows its unique and every episode is different i dont know which episodes youve seen but theres definitely at least one enjoyable episode for all types of people i have episode recommendations if you want though i do encourage watching it all in order i havent seen archer though i plan to but simpsons can be hit or miss because theres so many episodes so i would give it another shot and look for recommendations from people whove seen a lot of simpsons futurama is great too and theres a couple episodes that are must see cartoon episodes luck of the fryish and jurassic bark so keep your eye out for that
television,not_removed,i like how it looks like does it has continuity
television,not_removed,when i was a child i watched total drama island i enjoyed it a lot
television,not_removed,does samurai jack has an ongoing history never watched it when it was on tv
television,not_removed,i dont like how it is animated and watched some episodes and found it very random
television,not_removed,best show ever so sad it was cancelled
television,not_removed,the characters are consistent but theres not really an ongoing storyline its basically an animated sitcom
television,not_removed,its pure fun do you know it has several sequels
television,not_removed,not really there a few that continue but its pretty episodic in nature instead of serialized but the new season is supposed to be more of an ongoing history
television,not_removed,i suppose its not for everyone but there is a bit of a storyline eventually its mainly about the many adventures of the two
television,not_removed,i watched like two of them by the way what is over the garden wall about does it has any kind of continuity or an ongoing history
television,not_removed,over the garden wall is a miniseries with a self contained story its a great show id recommend to watch it in the fall as it really gets you into the season
television,not_removed,its only a season episodes long and id compare it to gravity falls when it comes to the tone its summarized as two brothers find themselves lost in a mysterious land and try to find their way home
television,not_removed,spike in btvs talking about why most demons dont really want to end the world i like the world youve got dograces and manchester united and people walking around like billions of happy meals on legs or any of mr freezes from heart of ice this is how i will always remember you surrounded by winter forever young forever beautiful rest well my love soon the monster who took you from me will learn that revenge is a dish best served cold think of it batman to never again walk on a summers day with the wind in your face and a warm hand to hold oh yes id kill for that
television,not_removed,anything al swearengen said in deadwood
television,not_removed,i remember this show when it was on the air it was terrible
television,not_removed,bill burr as the friend
television,not_removed,bill burr looks like rickety cricket before the gang fucked him up
television,not_removed,i remember this show ringwald was past being over the hill and the show was part of the flotsam and jetsam that was mid sitcoms
television,not_removed,other space was a really good show and the fact that no one ever saw it is entirely on paul for putting it on yahoo in the first place seriously how was that situation supposed to turn out even knowing it was there and wanting to watch it it was a huge pain in the butt to find episodes because their interface was cluttered and confusing
television,not_removed,i loved this show
television,not_removed,love this show its more like a hour movie than a hour tv show the solution in one episode becomes the problem in the next its hilarious and should be brought back
television,not_removed,paul you had me at milana vayntrub
television,not_removed,this was really good the time dilation episode was particularly hilarious
television,not_removed,this show is amazing i found it when i watched community on yahoo and i found it hilarious also the att girl is pretty great
television,not_removed,clearly these people have never seen futurama
television,not_removed,other space proved itself as the series wore on it was uncomfortable and not hilarious at the beginning and by the end hysterical and one of my favourite recent comedies each episode on the way was better than the previous i was disappointed to learn it has been cancelled when it appeared that it had really found its stride im not saying its res dwarf good red dwarf is still the ultimate in sci fi comedy but even red dwarf had its ups and downs and took a while to warm into a routine there is plenty of love for the original series but it was in that red dwarf really hit its stride every show takes a little time to grow i think other space earned it
television,not_removed,but i have seen it
television,not_removed,i love how feig omitted ghostbusters from his credentials in the promo i will watch this though if i can it looks pretty fucking funny edit words
television,not_removed,i agree with what some people have said here the first episode like many other shows was probably weak but it kept my interest enough then after that it picked up and was pretty funny and creative its major issue was being shown on yahoo of all places get netflix to pick this up and youd be golden
television,not_removed,i have too seen it its good
television,not_removed,didnt like it that much a lot of humor relies on the awkwardness of the situation instead of the actual jokes quite often silence is used as a punchline if i remember correctly
television,not_removed,i love paul feig but i couldnt get into this show i watched the first episode online but it just didnt click with me
television,not_removed,i watched the first season i would not bother with a second one ghostbusterettes was funnier and thats not saying much
television,not_removed,you dont put a show on yahoo because you have any other viable options
television,not_removed,paul was trying to get this done for years most of that time nbc owned the rights yahoo was the only one who offered to show it i agree it was doomed to fail yahoo platform was buggy and it was geoblocked so no one overseas could see it and yahoo never properly publicized the show or even yahoo screen itself in short they had no idea what they were doing
television,not_removed,well spread the word then thats what feig wants to do
television,not_removed,then that would be the funniest scifi comedy theyve never seen not the funniest scifi comedy youve never seen
television,not_removed,well the show did come out in and ghostbusters hadnt been released yet i dont think credentials usually mention unreleased stuff this video is also a fan promo so it isnt even official
television,not_removed,whats wrong with silence sometimes facial reactions are much funnier than a comedic line depends on the scene
television,not_removed,first episode is a little wonky but it picks up very quickly and is pure gold if you enjoy
television,not_removed,yes i agree that the first episode was an unfortunate weak point but every episode beyond is very very good i have watched the entire show several times through and i skip the first episode now this isnt uncommon though the first episode of most great shows are clumsy and awkward especially when there is a really ridiculous premise that has to be established because they try to do too much too quickly so they can just move on with the real meat of what they are trying to do
television,not_removed,ive been spreading the word for years unfortunately until now it seemed to be falling on deaf ears glad to see momentum pick up for its possible return
television,not_removed,i actually think episode was pretty good when rewatched after viewing the whole season i think the problem with the first episode of any new series is you really havent connected with the characters yet that takes time and this show is totally character driven
television,not_removed,westworld
television,not_removed,i dont know if i would put hannibal above silence of the lambs but i would put it above red dragon and the movie hannibal and possibly manhunter
television,not_removed,buffy the vampire slayer is the most obvious example im also a big fan of the men in black animated series i dont know that id rate it better than the original movie though definitely better than but it did a great job of expanding the universe the movie hinted at and remaining consistent to the tone
television,not_removed,buffy the vampire slayer
television,not_removed,limitless
television,not_removed,if its okay to revise the premise of the question a bit one example where the movie and the television show were both good but good for different reasons is mash
television,not_removed,just remembered before a thousand comments say it star wars the clone wars
television,not_removed,gonna have to vote for friday night lights
television,not_removed,friday night lights
television,not_removed,daredevil
television,not_removed,not sure about superior overall but i enjoyed the recent season of frequency i think i liked the father being a cop in this iteration better and them both working the case from different angles and leads in different time periods
television,not_removed,i wouldnt say its superior to the original movie but i think lethal weapon is superior to the third and fourth films dont get me wrong i love the movies even the fourth one but i think that the series does a good job of fleshing out the smaller characters like murtaughs family
television,not_removed,parenthood
television,not_removed,mash mash and mash god i hate that movie but its one of my favorite tv shows
television,not_removed,so its strange to see kurt russell being referred to as oneil as richard dean anderson fits a lot more with the oneil from the show they have a throw away line in the series about that show version of the character says that he keeps getting the others mail despite the show version of the character spelling his name with two ls instead of one he goes on to remark that the other guy is a lot less funny than he is
television,not_removed,stargate
television,not_removed,monkeys that show is so fucking good probably the best time travel series in a very long time
television,not_removed,if miniseries count i would say dune the scifi channel one that came out in or so was much better compared to the movie
television,not_removed,monkeys is the one that instantly comes to mind that hasnt already been said i know there are more was talking to my so about such movieshows on the weekend but have forgotten what was said
television,not_removed,your example of stargate is pretty dead on the movie was typical roland emmerich garbage and while the first season of was a little shaky it grew into a hell of a show pretty quickly atlantis was solid right off the bat universe eventually got good but only right before it was canceled
television,not_removed,shooter
television,not_removed,mash
television,not_removed,girlfriend experience
television,not_removed,id rate the jimmy neutron show over the movie esp the later seasons
television,not_removed,this is england its a continuation with the same people involved so kind of a cheat but the series goes so much deeper into things the movie doesnt have a chance to touch on the series got to be this intimately epic story of being young in thatchers england and theres all these beautiful details and side plots every character that seemed like an aside in the films gets their moment to shine even if its for a minute scene in a episode series you get this sense that if they felt like it they could follow any secondary character into a spinoff its that well realised they really create a world that feels like a documentary to watch in the best way the fact that so much of the cast werent big or professional actors made it feel even realer like you were watching a wellshot version of the series imo as culturally defining to british cinema as trainspotting if not moreso eta gonna go ahead and say hannibal the series is better than all of the movies in every way it looks better it does things that interest me more and i think itll hold up over time
television,not_removed,monkeys
television,not_removed,mash hate the movie with a whitehot passion
television,not_removed,deleted
television,not_removed,im an admitted hater of westworld i cant imagine how much id hate the movie if the show is better than it
television,not_removed,oh yeah i havent watched the movie yet is it at least good is the show a remake or a sequel
television,not_removed,but man the finale should have been the premier
television,not_removed,this is an example of a horrible boring adaption imo
television,not_removed,though i would say i prefer mads mikkelsens interpretation of the character over anthony hopkins i like that mads was very much like a devil playing with his puppets pushing humanity just because he found it interesting also his sense of style was great
television,not_removed,early culture kind of forced anthony to over act that role the silence of the lambs version works well as a contrast to jodi the darker quiet version works well on the show but in a movie you have to act big because you dont have plus hours to develop and reveal the character
television,not_removed,it was better than the initial premise hannibal lecter helps solve crimes leads you to believe easily one of the best shows of the last decade imo im very glad it got a sort of ending which will help it find future audiences
television,not_removed,i would i have really enjoyed sotl since i was a kid but hannibal the show is a completely different gorgeous nuanced and yet over the top drama i rewatch it constantly and find it beautiful every time
television,not_removed,the plot lines that the tv show did in season and were so much better than what the movies did in hannibal and red dragon
television,not_removed,til that buffy was a movie before it was a show the more you know
television,not_removed,the mib animated series is definitely better than both sequels
television,not_removed,that was more a reboot than anything joss whedon was very unsatisfied with the film interpretation and wanted to get it right with the tv show which he clearly did
television,not_removed,and now im sad again at least it got to have a conclusion more or less
television,not_removed,that was just the first three episodes of the series edited together and released theatrically dont know if its fair to say that the series was based on that
television,not_removed,god was that movie bad
television,not_removed,eh i wouldnt say the show is based on the movie same source material but luckily it looks like the people in charge of making the show never even watched the movie
television,not_removed,i dont know ed begley jr was no steve martin but it was a good role for a young leonardo dicaprio
television,not_removed,i mean thems fightin words the show is amazing and one the best on tv but the film is also incredible theres so much easier low hanging fruit to go for like buffy or stargate
television,not_removed,no i love the show a lot but i think the movie is one of the better dark comedies to ever exist
television,not_removed,oh yeah
television,not_removed,i rank them season movie season season and the film are pretty much equal standing for me i only really prefer season because as a series you have more time to become attached to the characters and flesh them out i love them both though while i enjoyed season and the cast i didnt find the characters anywhere near as compelling as season or the film i think it was the writing
television,not_removed,but not by much
television,not_removed,the film is perfect
television,not_removed,i agree i loved the movie but the show has edged past it for me but its a close one
television,not_removed,hard to say the tv series is really amazing and perfectly captures the movie but the movie is pretty great itself i think its a well made film with some great acting
television,not_removed,fuck no the movie is one of the best of all time
television,not_removed,eh i love the show but i recently watched the film again and its a really strong piece of work its hard to view that now because so many filmsshows not just this one have been influenced by it if not flat out ripped it off
television,not_removed,the movie has its moments but the show is in a whole other league it remains so incredibly socially relevant to this day while also being hysterically funny
television,not_removed,no fuckin way
television,not_removed,the show is better but the movie is pretty great too theyre completely different viewings though
television,not_removed,i assumed this would be the top rated response
television,not_removed,i need to catch up on this series but damn if its not great and i say that as someone who fucking loves the movie when the show was first announced i bitched and moaned about how they were going to completely ruin one of my favourite movies especially since it was syfy that was doing it after watching the first few episodes i had to take back every single bad word id said about it being a bad idea they nailed it they took the premise and ran and made it one of the best time travel shows that i can think of
television,not_removed,that first series from scifi isnt bad at all i agree but the follow up didnt feel as well produced the format of tv does feel better suited to telling the whole thing im hoping someone takes another shot at this one day
television,not_removed,i loved the book and enjoyed the movie but the show took a little while to grab me but the last or episodes were great
television,not_removed,its not based on the movie though the movie spun off from the show
television,not_removed,the movie is a different kettle of fish from the show the show spends a lot of time building up the idea of the robots being true sentient people and all the implications that arise from that should they be treated as equals are the humans any better than them is it ok to torture and kill someone repeatedly if you can wipe their memory and effectively undo everything you did to them etc the film is just yo these robots have gone postal time to get to fuck out of dodge
television,not_removed,the show is a remake and it is spectacular i would recommend it
television,not_removed,i would really call the show a reimagining keeps far fewer elements of the original than most remakes
television,not_removed,totally disagree it wouldnt have been nearly as cool or climactic nor would we have nearly enough context for our characters
television,not_removed,shh im only on episode
television,not_removed,mads was amazing in this role he really brought out all the nuances of evil and manipulation as a twisted sport
television,not_removed,it really is hard for me to choose between mikkelsen and hopkins they both are wonderful hopkins more so in silence of the lambs but for very different reasons
television,not_removed,its interesting because mads really took an entirely new interpretation of the role it definitely makes it hard to compare the two i too think i liked mads and his more nuanced satanic vibe for the role
television,not_removed,its been a while since ive seen silence of the lambs but i remember hopkins actually being quite understated as hannibal in that film aside from maybe one or two moments it was the other films red dragon and hannibal where hopkins began to overact
television,not_removed,especially the vergerarc they began in season and continued into season
television,not_removed,yeahapparently when joss whedon wrote it the tone was pretty close to buffy as we know it but the director had her own ideas and donald sutherland who played buffys original watcher each had their own ideas and the result wasnt funny enough to be a comedy not scary enough to be horror and justnot great but as others have pointed out paul reubens death scene is not to be missed the events of the movie were alluded to early on how they had to move to sunnydale after buffy burned down her school but otherwise it was pretty much ignored
television,not_removed,yup save yourself the disappointment and dont watch it though
television,not_removed,the opening of that show is very high quality among the best for me personally
television,not_removed,wasnt even supposed to be a film was supposed to just be the first three episodes of the series until george lucas suggested it be turned into a film a shame because the show is really good
television,not_removed,or learned from its mistakes
television,not_removed,season i think went for a more shock moment based breaking bad style than the first which was typical coen brothers writing i enjoyed season towards the end but i agree
television,not_removed,i love the movie which is why i love the show
television,not_removed,on par for what each thing was
television,not_removed,i really hate the movie it is so mean spirited imo the doctors are all assholes whereas the tv show has a far more humanistic outlook
television,not_removed,if youre still on season and think its great already youre in for a treat with season they dive much deeper into who the monkeys are plus much more jennifer
television,not_removed,a netflix original series maybe
television,not_removed,jimmy neutron nope the movie was first
television,not_removed,maybe id like that better then haha i felt like the show hardly challenged me as much as ex machina or the black mirror episodes ive seen on the robot feelingstechnological advancement areas
television,not_removed,from ops comment it sounded to me as though hed watched the show but not the movie one of us is not reading this right
television,not_removed,i was just making a reference to the snl sketch on la la land and westworld though i do think t he show could have been tightened up
television,not_removed,i mean the fava beans scene the fact that an old man so effortlessly over powers two cops he talks a man into killing himself through a wall lol the thrown jizz scene that movie is fantastic but his scenes are very bizarre under a microscope hannibal the movie is an abomination
television,not_removed,but paul reubens
television,not_removed,blasphemy johnny bravos luke perry is in the movie that alone makes it worth the watch and the vamp cramps
television,not_removed,why is that a shame
television,not_removed,how much of it did you watch also i guess the idea is that they wanted to have everything plot left for later on spoiler alert they only just truly achieved sentience in the finale
television,not_removed,thats right no reason to watch the movie other than seeing the differences
television,not_removed,doh thought that sounded like an oddly familiar opinion
television,not_removed,fava beans sure one of the more big moments i dont mind that he overpowers two guards he takes them by surprise and he does handcuff one of the guards to the cage and hopkins is not that old in sotl and he seems pretty fit hannibal is a master manipulator that just shows it im sure we would have had a scene just like that in the tv show if it wasnt canceled to be fair hannibal didnt throw the jizz he would and did consider that rude
television,not_removed,dont forget a very young ben affleck
television,not_removed,ill amend my statement watch it for the ridiculous camp value but dont expect anything like the show
television,not_removed,because it probably turned alot of people off from watching the show
television,not_removed,the movie itself is pretty good as long as you keep in mind that it was the so its a bit confined by the lack of visual effects they could use to convey that a large portion of the characters were robots throw in a few more stereotypical things and you start to see the picture a good solid film if a little dated
television,not_removed,and hilary swank
television,not_removed,omg i forgot
television,not_removed,im watching the show for the first time now im really enjoying it though the good is great and the bad is terrible in season one i k ow it gets better so im looking forward to that but i tried to watch the movie to start couldnt watch more than twenty minutes horrible horrible as luke would say what a piece of junk
television,not_removed,any conflict between felicity and oliver in arrow
television,not_removed,the drama with jim and pam in the last season of the office felt horribly contrived to me
television,not_removed,almost every damn season of supernatural forces some strange rift between sam and dean as a plot device
television,not_removed,the act of every judd apatow movie
television,not_removed,amy and rory filing for divorce in of doctor who all throughout theyre happily married and the only hint of their having marital issues was in a dvdexclusive minute long minisode not only that but the reason for the divorce amy being infertile made zero sense and their issues are resolved within the same episode that theyre introduced to the audience literally manufactured drama for the sake of drama moffats a hack
television,not_removed,most recently the omg this girl i am about to bang might be my sister from shadowhunters basically two characters clary and jace meet and are falling into lovelust but somehow they find out they might be half siblings i was drunk and dont remember exactly why they think this cue like four episodes of angst over the fact they made out a lot but now are maybe related the male character eventually joins his evil fathers evil army in an effort to run away from his sibling incest problems among other reasons all this could be solved by a dna test you can pick up at walmart
television,not_removed,in gilmore girls lorelai is totally happy with luke then when luke finds out he has a kid shes mad that he was embarrasseduncertain how to tell her not to mention that the kid is just terribly written the actress playing her was fine and hit all the notes that the script probably called for its just unfortunate that the script made the character little more than a precocioussupergenius ala tng season one wesley crusher anyway lorelai and luke are engaged she stays salty about the whole thing until calling off the wedding to get back together with rorys dad for a season its a mess and it kind of makes lorelai a little too unlikable same goes for earlier in the season when she gets mad at rory for taking a break from college it just doesnt mesh with what we know about these characters before it goes down but that frustration on lorelais part is a little more understandable since she sacrificed a lot for rory to go to an ivy league school even then it felt kinda forced too
television,not_removed,jim and pam on the office towards the end
television,not_removed,is it cheating if i say every single cw show if youve ever seen the man in the high castle then the love triangle in that theres like really awkward fight scenes that force it
television,not_removed,michael in lost the guys excuse being a complete asshole is always my son why i believe this is a conflict rather than just an annoyance is that in almost every conflict that michael has the exception being with jinn his son is his excuse for his actions often to the detriment of others used sparingly it could have made for a source of tension or relief of it but it became a frequent motivation for michael to the detriment of his character
television,not_removed,floki and ragnar in vikings
television,not_removed,jack bauers drug addiction in season it was like the writers wanted to give him something really hard to overcome while also trying to take down terrorism you can argue that it was necessary for the plot for him to go undercover but you can also argue that whole storyline was built around the idea that the writers needed a believable reason for jack to be addicted to heroin
television,not_removed,friday night lights season the landry murder storyline such a dumb trope that thankfully was abandoned
television,not_removed,flash and zoom zooms motivations were utter shit
television,not_removed,god the flash i quit at the end of season but the conflict between iris and barry was just so dumb i cant let iris know who i am to protect her so she can never know my secret identity but also every other villain either sees my face or finds out what my name is by the end of an episode if anything barry was making it tougher for iris without telling her who he is there was also an episode where barry as the flash beats the shit out of eddie because hes mad that eddies dating barrys adoptive sister when barry wants to that left me pissed off there was some mind control or emotional distortion shit happening i didnt really mind the hokey setup my issue was more that after barrys back to normal he goes to apologise to iris for beating up her boyfriendalso so they can both flirt a bit but he never apologises to eddie like dude hes the victim here come on writers dont just use this as a stupid way to progress the main romance
television,not_removed,suits has more of those than i can think of
television,not_removed,i feel like a nineteen year old or however old wally is would be justified in having conflict with an adopted older brother who has literally always had the life wally wanted maybe its not the most mature perspective but if we look at from wallys point of view barry is kind of a dick that never gives him the time of day the audience obviously sides with barry because we know hes the flash
television,not_removed,does elektra and the hand count in daredevil that entire subplot ruined the season—they should have just stayed focused on castle
television,not_removed,danny and riley fighting about danny sleeping with sam years or more ago and the fight is over he didnt tell her that but she found out while sam hadnt been in there lives for years or more do you always have to go slept with that when you met someone from the past baby daddy enjoyable show besides this
television,not_removed,the kevin smith episode was bad for lots of other reasons oh the speed force is like gravity sentient talking gravity does this mean gravity can speak too so the speedforce has morality and wants to help barry fulfill his destiny why do evil speedsters exist in that case why does the speedforce not help evil speedsters overcome their inner demons why does barry not ask these questions himself considering he is a man of science the episode is consistent with kevin smiths penchant for fulfilling his egolifelong comic nerd fantasies while offering little to the viewer
television,not_removed,nothing comes to mind but i have no tolerance for stupid writing click off theres plenty else to entertain me
television,not_removed,you put the safety of your son above my needs how dare you
television,not_removed,i just dont understand how the writers could mess up a show that much with just one character arrow or its current name felicity and friends was a show i used to look forward to up till the season maybe a little onward i tuned in for oliver kicking ass not felicity being a needy bitch the whole episode
television,not_removed,yep thats the worst
television,not_removed,to their credit its at least an interesting idea that theres someone whos existed behind the camera for so long who ostensibly has built strong relationships with the office it would have been much worse to have a new character show up from any other direction than behind the camera and i can sort of respect that logic versus an old boyfriend showing up out of the blue or her meeting someone new that said to us the viewers he did just show up out of the blue and that makes for not very satisfying conflict and a goofy to use the other replys word way to circumvent completely betraying the audience
television,not_removed,ruined the season for me theyre riding high for straight season and then all of the sudden it all unravels in like episodes was just goofy
television,not_removed,i only halfwatched that show at the end didnt they introduce some british female character whose entire purpose was to tempt jim into cheating on pam
television,not_removed,it makes a certain amount of sense because if i was forced to spend every waking moment with my brother and disagreements could literally have worldending consequences wed be at each others throats from a story perspective it does get a bit tiresome though
television,not_removed,what do you mean youre leaving me what do you mean im what do you mean im not a virgin anymore
television,not_removed,the reason for the divorce amy being infertile made zero sense there was a reaction video for asylum of the daleks that i unfortunately i cant find now it pointed out that the doctor knows cats that can cure everything and the doctor himself had a vial of something that could take care of a brain aneurysm yeah infertility would have been easy to solve if amy had been open about it
television,not_removed,to me the reason for the divorce made sense rory really wanted kids learning your wife is infertile makes the relationship different arguments happen because you wanna blame someone for stopping you having a child and then boom divorce it makes sense
television,not_removed,shit like that is why i stopped watching doctor who moffat is a fucking hack
television,not_removed,wait they made a tv series out of those books why
television,not_removed,i can never take a series seriously if it evilbig bad character is name valentine
television,not_removed,most recently the omg this girl i am about to bang might be my sister from shadowhunters lol that should have made it better
television,not_removed,he also actively tried to hide his kid from lorelai and didnt tell her for a while even though the whole town knew lorelai showed up to the diner and randomly talked to her and found out she didnt call off the wedding either but she did offer an ultimatum which are pretty bad you cant force someone to make a decision like that and there was the whole thing with ana the kids mother who didnt trust lorelai after that birthday party i do agree with the latter part but it must have sucked for lorelai to go to her parents for their help and then having them double back on their discussion after getting convinced by rory
television,not_removed,to this day i cant watch anything with vanessa marano in it
television,not_removed,the man in the high castle would have been exponentially better had they just cut out the two young white supermodel leads jesus christ the ending of that first season pissed me off so much if it had just been the officers confrontation with hitler it would have ended on such a high note but no stupid characters make stupid decisions
television,not_removed,it was alright until they made it into a stereotypical destroy the universe plan
television,not_removed,thats one of the few things that isnt stupid a super hero shouldnt go around just telling every asshole they know their secret identity
television,not_removed,i agree i found everything about elektra to be contrived bullshit
television,not_removed,we can all agree that sam is smoking hot though right
television,not_removed,kevin smith didnt write the episode he just directed it
television,not_removed,haha this was the most ridiculous scene i mean it made sense why he did it plus the mother had explicitly asked him to tell no one or risk never seeing his son again it was just dumb but then again im not that huge arrow fan
television,not_removed,i thought it was a backdated cameraman and pam
television,not_removed,thats actually a really good way to look at the show
television,not_removed,yeah but not even that like even if it was incurable why would they get a divorce instead of talking about it even once lmao
television,not_removed,rory didnt even know she was infertile until after they separated and even if the character motivation did make sense which it doesnt the execution was still laughable
television,not_removed,rory really wanted kids learning your wife is infertile makes the relationship different thats retarded though not being able to have your own biological kids is only a big deal if youre a slave to your stupid animal instinct
television,not_removed,dude i feel you dunno why im still watching lol
television,not_removed,money
television,not_removed,lets be honest there is only reason i that show
television,not_removed,we are not all lannisters
television,not_removed,i dont disagree that what luke did was wrong just that lorelais response was over the top and forced i forget what the ultimatum is since i havent gotten to that part in my rewatch i watched most of the show as it aired but caught up on the first two seasons via abc family reruns so my memory of it is pretty hazy after years obviously i just got to lanes wedding a few weeks ago but im so blah about this season that ive been taking pretty frequent breaks from it whereas prior seasons i was watching episodes per week starting in january i remembered not enjoying season seven much but six isnt floating my boat either agreed regarding lorelais parents it felt a bit like she took it out on rory instead of them her mostlyfriendly interactions with richard during that part of the show feel incongruent to the rest of the storyline i think its a good idea for a conflict but the execution was a little off hell going back earlier its weird that emily suddenly dislikes lorelailuke when she was sorta pushing the idea in the first season so even thats a bit forced though it ultimately makes sense for her to disapprove of lorelais choice of a lower class person i do not envy tv writers for a show like gilmore girls because its gotta be difficult as it progresses to find conflicts that flow well with already resolved ones its not like genre tv where you can easily bring in an external threat for conflict
television,not_removed,i agree with you on the supermodel leads both of their story arcs were riddled with dumbshit why didnt they just run the fucking marshall over with the truck they only had two opportunities per episode that the marshall was in how the fuck did she get a job at the japanese hq even though her sister was a known resistance fighter boyfriend to a guy whos family was gassed for possible treason and she herself had been investigated how was the boyfriend not executed yes i get that the japanese figured out erroneously he was not involved but he would have been executed anyway just out of general principle the whole thing with the antique merchant was wtf stupid i get how he fit in but how the show handled the sale of the bullets was just so badly done the man in the high castle is a good show that can be great but it is not there are parts that astounded me with how clumsy it is but over all it is a good watch
television,not_removed,i liked elektra but hated the hand plot why did they have to make her ninja jesus
television,not_removed,if youve see the bts special youll see he didnt direct it more so geeked out and had many fan moments
television,not_removed,brian the sound guy but yeah he was interested in pam not jim
television,not_removed,you find out that they even ended up adopting a son
television,not_removed,well that same thing happened in the books and it was just as dumb
television,not_removed,good for you i liked the girl who played isabelle but even she cannot make me continue watching it
television,not_removed,enjoy your rewatch i do agree that finding compelling conflicts could be hard
television,not_removed,aye im still confused about one thing with the boyfriend hes jewish or part jewish but is atheist when his friend reads scripture in hebrew the guy breaks down into tears and seems to have some sort of religious experience he even says amin yet in the very next episode hes all oh yeah i dont believe that stuff then what was that crying shite
television,not_removed,why did they have to make her ninja jesus that is who she is in the comics well that is what she becomes there are good ways to handle that and there are not so good ways and well this show
television,not_removed,oh i never read them so didnt know it happened in both
television,not_removed,i watched it while drunk
television,not_removed,i am though i might skip season seven just going right to the finale i distinctly remember thinking the show lost its way as that season aired supposedly most of that season will be borderline irrelevant for the new season
television,not_removed,yeah its like theres a huge disconnect the hyperrealistic street daredevil and the silly ninja shit they nailed the first part they just need to do better with the ninja shit
television,not_removed,huh i always thought he said oh most definitely
television,not_removed,rip such a funny dude
television,not_removed,definitely the work of a flamer
television,not_removed,dude is one of my favorite stand ups ever sad he died so young
television,not_removed,too bad he was such an asshole
television,not_removed,you thought that because thats what he does say
television,not_removed,oh most definitely
television,not_removed,whoever made the title of that youtube video was definitely white
television,not_removed,i thought it was almost definitely which was hilarious also
television,not_removed,not enough ive gone through the shows on oa the episodes of black phillip his appearance on alex jones marc maron tough crowd i dont think ill ever be able to have a sustainable relationship again after four years of listening to him explain why women are terrible he is my prophet
television,not_removed,i cant imagine arrested development having had a lot of nonwhite viewers
television,not_removed,im white but i used to listen to patrice on opie and anthony every week so i know his voice
television,not_removed,i didnt know he was on alex jones i have to find that now i could listen to years of him miss the big bastard
television,not_removed,why
television,not_removed,von was cool people that let him have threesomes regularly id love the chick too
television,not_removed,because the main cast couldnt have been any
television,not_removed,i think youre forgetting about
television,not_removed,i dunno man i count a jew an arab and at least canadians in that photo
television,not_removed,i always assumed people watched comedies for the jokes fool on me
television,not_removed,it aint easy bein brown
television,not_removed,sorry franklin
television,not_removed,canadians arent white til
television,not_removed,its actually vastly more complex than that relatability and familiarity are huge factors in audience engagement otherwise we wouldnt have stars and recurring casts just lists of jokes
television,not_removed,no were officially clear
television,not_removed,exactly you will not get half the jokes in ar unless you have owned a boat or run a business but i do agree with what you say
television,not_removed,so minority groups cant become familiarised with white casts
television,not_removed,its not that your previous comments werent obvious trolling its that i was amusing myself by predicting what you would write next
television,not_removed,that is hilarious on many levels
television,not_removed,i guess they finally figured out it was old punk rockers making fun of old hippies id like to also point out the name of the bookstore most likely comes from women and children first in chicago where fred used to live
television,not_removed,well that escalated quickly
television,not_removed,as a kid i always identified with carlton in this clip growing up somewhere that had very few nonwhite people i remember thinking well yeah i mean i would stop a car driving that slow too as i got older i understood what will meant
television,not_removed,im not questioning the validity of the argument when i ask this but wouldnt you be hassled for going too slow
television,not_removed,was will a syrain refugee
television,not_removed,yes that was my point i remember thinkingwell anyone would get stopped for driving too slow obviously growing up where i grew up the sort of racism will was talking about where the boys were automatically assumed to have stolen the car wasnt something i had experienced
television,not_removed,even the linked trailer which has english subtitles was posted by
television,not_removed,ive been watching this and really enjoying it i think a few jokes are culturally over my head all the seemingly racist stuff about the african colonies but most of it is quite good also mathilde warnier the love interest he meets in episode two man too much for me probably my main reason for watching really
television,not_removed,i think even if a joke is over your head such as ones dealing with the relationship between france and african countries or france and algeria algeria is france in the theyre still funny just contextually i think by far my favorite joke is the conversation between the french agents and the two cia agents not sure of the episode i think its a great show and was surprised when i found no links in rtelevision for it
television,not_removed,lost arrested development the simpsons and community had some good commentary on select episodes
television,not_removed,best commentary i have ever heard was on a british comedy called red dwarf it was funny and most importantly very informative
television,not_removed,maddeningly ambiguous what finale did the author watch
television,not_removed,what i dont think anyone can consider that finale maddeningly ambiguous its mostly tied up in a little bow
television,not_removed,i absolutely dont understand why so many journalists are referring to the finale as ambiguous i believe thr and nytimes did the same thing there was nothing ambiguous about it
television,not_removed,yeah i wouldnt call the ending ambiguous you dont know for sure if that guy did it you dont watch him do it but youre pretty sure and thats not even what the show is really about anyway what matters is naz future and theres nothing ambiguous about that
television,not_removed,the crime wasnt definitively solved so she does have a point
television,not_removed,not really that doesnt mean i didnt like the conclusion but at best it pointed to another suspect granted a likely suspect but still only a suspect nevertheless
television,not_removed,so youre convinced the cop figured out the murder okay but it was still left open to question the guy was a likely suspect but we dont know that he didnt it any more than whether naz did it edit my phone wants me to hate it
television,not_removed,yeah i wouldnt call the ending ambiguous you dont know for sure if that guy did it you dont watch him do it but youre pretty sure well thats the thing there wasnt definitive closure and the evidence was all circumstantial there was no smoking gun other than his having a motive and the things he did that night that could be observed from recordings it sure didnt look good for him but it didnt look good for naz either and the latter only got off because of a hung jury which is something that would always being hanging over his head
television,not_removed,sure but theres a difference between explicitly spelling out every detail of what happened and a maddeningly ambiguous finale its silly hyperbole we know who killed andrea by the end of the finale and we know why
television,not_removed,it doesnt matter all that much who killed andrea because thats not what the show is really about you mentioned in another comment about how the justice system is portrayed in the show lawyers juries etc whoever killed her is secondary the justice system is truly what the night of is all about
television,not_removed,pointed to a suspect they have him on video getting rid of what is most likely the murder weapon he also has motive he clearly did it and they made that as clear as possible without adding a heres what happened down the road montage
television,not_removed,what purpose does that serve in the narrative if it wasnt him
television,not_removed,no he was just another suspect that may have appeared guilty same as naz did but for different reasons i dont think the point of the series was to definitively give us the answer to the question of who the murderer was i think it just gave us more to chew on in that regard and to perhaps decide for ourselves
television,not_removed,naz had what could just as easily have been the murder weapon in his pocket he was demonstrably shown to have been in her apartment on the night and at the time she was murdered no it wasnt proven that the other killed heronly that he had motive and perhaps opportunity but no hard conclusive evidence that he actually did it either
television,not_removed,well look at what the author of the piece has to say about it the whole point of the night of was that there are no tidy conclusions in the criminal justice system and that the truth is often beside the point
television,not_removed,no he was just another suspect that may have appeared guilty same as naz did but for different reasons the writers clearly intended for the viewer to conclude that the final suspect was the culprit i dont think the point of the series was to definitively give us the answer to the question of who the murderer was i think it just gave us more to chew on in that regard and to perhaps decide for ourselves i totally agree with this frankly im surprised we got as much of an answer as we did i thought it would be left totally openended particularly during the trial sequences in the first half of the finale when each suspect seemed equally plausible
television,not_removed,i never said they proved he killed her we as and audience are suppose to come to that conclusion though the other guy had the motive he was seen fighting with her scene getting on the highway paying cash when he has an easy pass to avoid being seen and then sketchily throwing something away on the side of the road in an area he wouldnt normally be in from a narrative stand point we are suppose to assume he did it that is not ambiguous from a story telling stand point or in the context people usually use that word in this medium lost and the sopranos could be considered maddeningly ambiguous not this show
television,not_removed,yes nazs story ends very messily and were left to ponder his fate and the truth of the case wasnt the point of the show they lean very heavily in one direction but they dont explore his capture because the show was never a mystery waiting to be solved it was merely an exploration of nazs moment in the justice system that quote doesnt mean the one guy likely didnt do it
television,not_removed,the writers clearly intended for the viewer to conclude that the final suspect was the culprit and yet there are all these articles wherein the authors dont seem to think so spoiler warning what was also interesting about the finale is that both the da and the arresting officer after discovering new evidence that indicated an equally likely suspect if not more so each decided to let the trial move forward rather than intervening to stop it consciously aware that a miscarriage of justice might well occur if naz was found guilty by the jury that kind of disgusted me but i couldnt say it wasnt realistic because it was which is why our justice system can also arguably be considered little more than a big joke all too often
television,not_removed,why do you think writers for these mainstream media news and entertainment publications dont see it the way you do im not trying to tell you your point of view is wrong or invalid im only playing devils advocate here you may well see the conclusion as being cutanddried but a lot of other people dont and that was also by design the series was intentionally ended the way it was to evoke these kinds of responses
television,not_removed,ya knowyou people can vote me down all you want but despite all your protests to the contrary it wasnt conclusively proven that the final suspect was guilty either there was circumstantial evidence but no hard proof that he was even in the murdered girls apartment that night let alone that he killed her
television,not_removed,and yet there are all these articles wherein the authors dont seem to think so web writers need clicks contrarian takes get clicks which is why our justice system can also arguably be considered little more than a big joke i challenge you to find a justice system that is superior to ours it is deeply flawed but it works better than most if not all others
television,not_removed,someone writing for a mainstream media news and entertainment publication doesnt mean they are necessarily correct about something like this they want to get as many clicks as possible and they discuss things from all different points of view ive seen tons of reputable news organizations say naz was smoking crack throughout the show when its without a doubt heroin regardless the title is hyperbole and i dont see how it can be considered maddening ambiguous again something like lost or the sopranos is maddeningly ambigous if they ended the show with the jury walking out and then fade to black or something that would be maddeningly ambiguous leave a few things up to the viewer while also wrapping most of the show up is not in my opinion ambiguous when we talk about it in the context of the ending of a tv show sure its messy but its suppose to be and i dont think who killed the girl was ever suppose to be up for debate after the final we can agree to disagree though
television,not_removed,i havent downvoted you there wasnt a purpose to his addition other than the heavily imply he did it if they wanted a loose end the police could have simply been shown looking more deeply into the other three suspects shown during the trial
television,not_removed,your arguments are maddeningly obtuse
television,not_removed,web writers need clicks contrarian takes get clicks but i felt the same way just after watching it thats not to say i was overly bothered by it because i figured it was designed that way intentionally given the kind of show it is i challenge you to find a justice system that is superior to ours it is deeply flawed but it works better than most if not all others you missed the last part of my comment that you quoted i think a lot of trials are little more than farces depending on the case so much of it hinges on which attorney of the two sides can make the most persuasive argument regardless of actual innocent or guilt and whether members in a jury can be played rather than actually deciding a case based on its merits or lack thereof i worked in one of the largest law firms in the country for eight years and let me tell ya it definitely isnt about actually getting to the truth all too often
television,not_removed,someone writing for a mainstream media news and entertainment publication doesnt mean they are necessarily correct about something like this it doesnt necessarily mean theyre wrong either and were not talking about one outlier of an article here or there that is contrary to a majority of others published about the same thing if its several its worthy of taking note of and if someone would rather not do that its only because theyre personally satisfied with the conclusion they came to and arent interested in hearing or reading anything different that may challenge their own viewpoint they want to get as many clicks as possible and they discuss things from all different points of view the first part of your statement is cynical and you dont appeal to a majority of people by telling them that their perception is flat out wrong you are right about them wanting to discuss things from different points of view though which is the whole point here and was the point of that ending to the series as well in my view or it would have been definitively clearcut and not open to interpretation sure its messy but its suppose to be and i dont think who killed the girl was ever suppose to be up for debate after the final i think box laid out a strong case in front of a jury it would have been very compelling but it wasnt enough to get weiss to change her trajectory she would have gladly gotten naz convicted despite the new evidence viewers look at those things and dont simply disregard them out of hand we can agree to disagree though sounds good
television,not_removed,fine take it up with the writers of the hollywood reporter and the new york times while youre at it and take youre antagonistic bait with you too im not interested
television,not_removed,we stop the whole discussion about ambiguity and all that we both made our points this is an interesting thing though i think box laid out a strong case in front of a jury it would have been very compelling but it wasnt enough to get weiss to change her trajectory she would have gladly gotten naz convicted despite the new evidence viewers look at those things and dont simply disregard them out of hand i think the whole point of that encounter and situation is to show that a prosecutor doesnt necessarily care about who did it they have politically fueled jobs where they are put under pressure to get results at any cost i think at that moment she knew naz didnt do it but that didnt matter since she thought she could convict naz edit one of the scariest and most telling scenes in the entire show
television,not_removed,isnt it a little telling that every single poster in here overwhelmingly disagrees with you a small handful of people posting to a message board is nothing more than anecdotal and doesnt necessarily mean much so no take your mainstream slashfilmcom clickbai bullshit articles and your downvote complaining self out of here if you cant handle being told youre objectively wrong except that im not objectively wrong you nasty miserable louse take yourself the hell out of here if you dont like the thread the article it links to or my presenting another side that youre not interested in listening to
television,not_removed,i know that in some iterations of the archie comics the storyline takes a darker route but i think most people think of archie and the gang as just a group of teenagers who hang out in a malt shop and sing vapid this trailer is well outside that
television,not_removed,i think ill check this out could be interesting
television,not_removed,any permutation of archie comics should be a comedy this is just straight up stupid and has absolutely nothing to do with the comics
television,not_removed,i saw the video thumbnail and thought i saw walter jr for a second
television,not_removed,does anyone else feel like this trailer is giving us nothing okay not nothing but very little to go on from the perspective of someone who didnt immediately connect riverdale with archie comics i had to wiki it this is a show about teenagers in a small town who play football and wear capes and have bags of money and someone gets murdered yellow body bag and also sad boygirl relationship what is this about honestly without telling me what archie comics is about going from just the information in the trailer they reference vampire diaries and gossip girl two shows with completely different themes who are only related by individual nonplot related elements like love triangles hot shirtless guys and relationship drama based on this trailer i dont even feel like i want to watch the show to find out what its about i just want a damn logline so i can decide if i give a crap sorry for the grumpiness i was attacked by a wafflebutt spider in my dreams
television,not_removed,what the hell is this shit nothing like comics i read as a kid the flash is pretty close to the mark but then this gets shit out
television,not_removed,if the title wasnt riverdale and the subject of this post didnt mention archie comics i wouldnt guess it had anything to do with archie
television,not_removed,afterlife with archie is a comic series that is absolutely the best archie anything ive ever read that writer is the showrunner for this
television,not_removed,but you will end up watching it just by hearing you babble about it i know you will
television,not_removed,lol good call i will probably end up streaming the pilot on the cw website but chances are it will make it as far as frequency and supergirl did or the new version of macgyver over on cbs which is to say i turn it off after the first five to fifteen minutes and never go back to it again
television,not_removed,that was one of my favorite shows when i was little my fave character was amber
television,not_removed,mine was jack
television,not_removed,this was soooooo right on bugs is higher underutilized in animation today it almost represents a step back in animation that we simply dont have a character this versatile sophisticated and believable in so many different roles and personas
television,not_removed,while i like this guys videos i usually disagree with a number of the things he says for example there is a modern flintstones comic that is actually really good and mickey mouse has characterization in the comics by floyd gottfredson and in the new mickey mouse shorts that come out he also has a personality there and isnt just an icon
television,not_removed,bugs bunnywoody woodpeckermickey mouse﻿
television,not_removed,the current the flintstones published by dc comics is amazing
television,not_removed,for example there is a modern flintstones comic that is actually really good i dont think he said you cant make a good flintstones story but that the flintstones are defined by the honeymooners influence so taking it out changes them while bugs is still himself no matter the costume or situation because hes always been like that hes even his own leading lady
television,not_removed,yeah i feel like were reaching a point where people will just love and upvote this guy just because its him and not because his videos are amazing dont get me wrong a lot of them are great but there are also some that just make me go meh
television,not_removed,im pretty sure his jurassic park video was just to get views the way it used cgi vs other movies has been articulated so many times
television,not_removed,what do you mean by that
television,not_removed,i used to love animaniacs as a kid long before i knew what goodfellas was watching this now i cant help but lmao at how these pigeons were basically joe pesci ray liotta and robert deniro﻿
television,not_removed,the original angry bird﻿
television,not_removed,you talking to me
television,not_removed,the simulation of joe pesci is uncanny plus the things he says just make me crack up
television,not_removed,or this scene
television,not_removed,thats it
television,not_removed,oj made in america was fantastic a must watch
television,not_removed,i agree with the americans it is very underrated show
television,not_removed,broad city portlandia unbreakable kimmy schmidt lady dinymite veep silicon valley game of thrones maron
television,not_removed,i didnt like the girlfriend experience sure it made you uncomfortable with its premise and the topic but nothing happens for episodes the characters are flat and there is no depth to them you dont care for them the atmosphere and tone of the show reminded me of mrrobot i watch almost anything but i couldnt watch this and gave up three episodes in
television,not_removed,ok blackish but not preacher and blackish are you serious
television,not_removed,has game of thrones ever been better than it was this season yes seasons if you like inarticulate action sequences and weak characterization then sure i will admit i did enjoy it more than and
television,not_removed,the only reason its on the list is to be controversial and create comments like the one you just posted which gets clicks
television,not_removed,very slow paced but really great its gets interesting by episode is one of the best episodes ive watched since so far its slow but it helps if you like watching sex scenes wellmost of them were boringbut there was a ton of sex
television,not_removed,hey i actually love blackish i think that preacher doesnt count in this conversation just yet some of these shows just ended im loving preacher and these people can add to their if they wanted to its not a ranking
television,not_removed,the vibe i got was that it would have served better as a episode miniseries it was pretty slow paced do you agree that it has some similarities with mrrobot the general vibe tone atmosphere of this show felt like mr robot both shows are slow paced but mrrobot had an interesting premise and the pilot was good enough to pull you in while i had to force myself to watch three episodes of this after which i gave up
television,not_removed,do you agree that it has some similarities with mrrobot nope not at all completely different shows they dont share any similarities neither with pacing writing nor cinematography mr robot is more of a public show imoit appeals to a wider audience than the girlfriend experience not everyone will get into tge
television,not_removed,yeah i agree the show is not for me art is subjective
television,not_removed,chuck breaking bad if you havent
television,not_removed,ray donovan
television,not_removed,ive watch most of chuck i dont think i seen maybe the last seasons ive watch all of breaking bad and try to watch better call saul but cant get into it
television,not_removed,i do like liev schreiber ive never watch ray donovan because i dont have access to showtime
television,not_removed,i repeatedly forget its even louie anderson playing the part he really does such an amazing job
television,not_removed,mischief were you chasing around a mouse love this show and christine is a big part of why i love it
television,not_removed,communist poodles how did they get in the country yes i agree with you his character is really the heart and soul of that show the episode where she confronts her brother over their mothers house was fantastic and the ronald reagan museum so good
television,not_removed,he is absolutely amazing as christine baskets
television,not_removed,he was interviewed on npr and talked about how he holds back his really dark jokes when he does standup he told one about killing your entire family that was darkly hilarious if you like him on the show its well worth a listen
television,not_removed,im really happy to see someone post this his performance is truly incredible
television,not_removed,spent days giggling to myself thinking of the first scene with the water bottle
television,not_removed,i literally had to google louie to convince my year old son that he was a the character was played by a man
television,not_removed,the scene where she goes and does watercize in the ocean was amazing such a small act that has so much meaning and weight behind it pun intended
television,not_removed,whos rating it ghosts its a quirky show but louie is definitely the best part
television,not_removed,communist poodles
television,not_removed,this resurgence of his is really wonderful this is definitely the greatest role he has ever had and i think he will win another emmy next year its nice to see him taking his health more seriously as well as a result
television,not_removed,louies performance is truly incredible one of the most honest performances i have ever seen anywhere
television,not_removed,i heard louie on a podcast talking about the role he said most of his mannerisms and sayings are based on his mother when said his mom always had to put a positive spin on everything in weird ways the scene where he takes a sip of water and chokes on it and then says something like that hit the spot wasnt scripted he actually choked on the water in the scene and just channeling his mother threw that line in and they kept it
television,not_removed,spectacuar he deserved the emmy last year he deserves another one this year
television,not_removed,best show on tv
television,not_removed,my husband and i started the season of this show last night and louie anderson is awesome and hilarious the rest of my comment is not to incite folks to be rude to me so chill we only saw the episodes and i found chip to be more pitiful than funny he is not even kind of a likeable character please tell me this show just starts slow and picks up and becomes funny at this point the only reason i would watch would be christine baskets
television,not_removed,louie deserves every fucking millimeter of that emmy hell he deserves a bigger one
television,not_removed,hes the only person who could wear a shirt with the name of the show hes on without it bothering me in the slightest no one else could pull that shit off his performance as christine is just so damn impressive and more authentic than anything ive ever seen on tv if i were him id be covered headtotoe in basketsbranded merch because id want every god damn person with eyes and a heart to see what will probably be remembered as my lifes greatest work fuck the mcconaissance im with the andersonian revolution
television,not_removed,i think the focus of the show turned from the twins to christine as the show moved forward im sure they had their feedback studies told them she was a winner
television,not_removed,he is amazing
television,not_removed,my goal in life is to be half the man mama baskets thinks i can be
television,not_removed,heres a great interview on npr with louie where he discusses among many other things his mom being the inspiration for the character
television,not_removed,i bet that as a young man he never foresaw his career headed in this direction glad it worked out for him
television,not_removed,he is award winning
television,not_removed,courageous is not an adjective that should be used for an actor doing their job
television,not_removed,louie anderson is still alive
television,not_removed,courageous
television,not_removed,i wish the show would focus more on chip dale and martha christine is a good side character but i couldnt give a shit about her romance story arc season was nowhere near as strong as season martha was barely in it
television,not_removed,thats a huuuuge bitch
television,not_removed,me too he is truly creating a living character so good incredible smart brave as heck show
television,not_removed,chyap stay where i can see you
television,not_removed,martha too love martha
television,not_removed,the show is called fresh air for anyone curious
television,not_removed,wait he didnt watch louies kids show maybe he was a bit young for it
television,not_removed,yep
television,not_removed,do you live in thailand
television,not_removed,the show sort of transforms into an ensemble cast in the second season
television,not_removed,the show definitely picks up as it goes and season is much better than but the show never really becomes funny there are jokes and some moments will make you laugh but the show is much more of a bittersweet drama
television,not_removed,yeah i think what zach is doing with this show is pretty interesting it doesnt seem like hes playing his characters too biglike hes the only center of attention so when i watch the show i can almost get into the storyscene through various characters not just the main one to your point though im not even sure either of zachs characters are my favourite but i still dig the show but maybe its that whole thing sometimes the sum is greater than its parts
television,not_removed,the more you watch the better it gets and it starts out pretty damn good
television,not_removed,he is not even kind of a likable character thats the point its a certain type of humor not everyone gets its very much like louis cks show louie as louis ck is the head writer for baskets its just a style that doesnt work for everyone
television,not_removed,i just wish my mom had a costco membership
television,not_removed,id say in every job there can be times where people can be more courageous than otherswhether it be firefighter or actor
television,not_removed,courage can have a different meaning based on context you dont need to conflate a fire fighter charging into a burning building with an actors performance they can both be courageous in a different way
television,not_removed,i agree the concept of courage needs to be reserved for more than an actor taking a role that might be risky for future employment if the role fails which this clearly does not in this case i could say i absolutely love this show but that would be overusing those words i enjoy this show very much and hope it goes on to many seasons i just get tired of all the hyperbole and drama about everything lately i just think clickbait titles and agendas are affecting the english language resulting in the desire to overdo for attention
television,not_removed,and delivering the performance of his career
television,not_removed,his appearing in a new series certainly makes me think he is
television,not_removed,fucking humongous
television,not_removed,monotone uhokayi guess i can do that for you
television,not_removed,yeah would be too young by a couple years i cant remember seeing reruns stretching up to when hed be able to remember
television,not_removed,i still say i heartily dislike instead of hate because of that show start at
television,not_removed,am did watch
television,not_removed,
television,not_removed,i like louis ck i watch a lot of strange foreign comedy and attempted to see it more as high art comedy and im still not getting there
television,not_removed,the internet has convinced a world of whiny cowardly nobodies that they are eloquent valiant world heroes be impressed with someone but express that feeling effectively and truthfully dont bury the truth under your attempts to stand out you just look silly and childish
television,not_removed,what a comeback very happy for him
television,not_removed,im and every blond fat kid in high school was nicknamed louie
television,not_removed,you must love the smell of your own shit
television,not_removed,i used to be a huge fan of his animated show as a kid happy to see him doing well
television,not_removed,i love this show and im surprised how unsettling it was to see them sitting opposite of where they normally do its like my brain kept wanting to correct what it was seeing but couldnt creeped me right out
television,not_removed,i always enjoy the arguments where they keep throwing eachother under the bus and create more arguments
television,not_removed,theyre just jealous i love this show so much
television,not_removed,annies pretty young we try not to sexualise her
television,not_removed,donald glover always grows too big for his friends the dudes in derrick comedy were left behind to make golden corral commericals danny pudi is stuck doing a dc shitcom hes the type of dude that would blow up and flat leave his bro to administer a mining colony on bespin
television,not_removed,yep community fans notice that the video is horizontally flipped simply because theyre not sitting in their usual places round the table
television,not_removed,thank you i felt like sometihng was wrongunfamiliar but couldnt put my finger on it havent seen community for over a year at this point
television,not_removed,
television,not_removed,ill admit that it took me way too long to notice it was flipped i havent seen this episode in a while so i thought the difference in placements was intentional to reflect the discord among the group
television,not_removed,looking forward to hbos westworld for some scifi goodness and the american gods show directed by the guy who did hannibal
television,not_removed,american gods legion atlanta and westworld are the shows im anticipating most
television,not_removed,legion created by fargos noah hawley
television,not_removed,rick and morty season three
television,not_removed,i know its still in the writing stage and production is uncertain but man cant wait for deadwood
television,not_removed,goliath amazon
television,not_removed,the deuce its a show about porn by the guy who made the wire
television,not_removed,i happened to see a trailer on here about a month before stranger things came out and was pretty much on board instantly right now as far as new shows go the good place maybe the pitch unsure joel mchales show but its on cbs so my expectations are quite low
television,not_removed,westworldiron fist maybe lethal weapon and timeless and luke cage comes out this month
television,not_removed,bryan fuller doesnt direct he writes and produces
television,not_removed,the sjws win again hey dont belittle my alma mater
television,not_removed,jee thats a disproportionate amount of people of colour i mean a jobs a job and good for them but i feel this is people getting hired because of their skin colour or gender not because of their talent
television,not_removed,at cornell university they have an incredible piece of scientific equipment known as the tunneling electron microscope now this microscope is so powerful that by firing electrons you can actually see images of the atom the infinitesimally minute building blocks of our universe if i were using that microscope right now i still wouldnt be able to locate my interest in your news bite
television,not_removed,yeah neatly finished its good
television,not_removed,whenwhere will it be available in the us
television,not_removed,i like splatter violence
television,not_removed,read all books i find vikings a little better but thats personal choice this is really a true to the books series very little is left out and although i thought an odd choice for uthreds actor he really got the vibe projected in the books that same cockyness absolutely love it glad they didnt meege characters and include steapa snotor and finan major characters i was sooo sure finan would be replaced by halig and steapa by aelfric is epicly good bettwr than
television,not_removed,season is on netflix us apparently try season is coming in may according to official twitter
television,not_removed,so much better that vikings my only criticism is that its super rushed and the plot barely has time to breathe i wish it was just a book per season instead of two or the seasons were episodes
television,not_removed,i think you can find the first season on netflix
television,not_removed,ive just binged vikings absolutely loved it though had some low points towards the end will have to check out this show o
television,not_removed,to be fair i never liked vikings even during its supposed good seasons i found it too directionless with poor acting bland characters and terrible anachronistic dialogue tlk is an improvement on all these fronts imo vikings only outstrips it due to higher budget and better choreographed and edited battle scenes
television,not_removed,just because the mcdouble is the most sold hamburger doesnt mean the entire hamburger industry is stale judging the superhero genre by the biggest blockbusters is a mistake
television,not_removed,i mention jojo because of revolutionary it was for shonen manga you keep mentioning this jojo as if you think weve all heard of it and can share your point of reference maybe you should have posted this to a manga sub rather than assume that readers of this sub know what that is
television,not_removed,nobody knows wtf you are talking about
television,not_removed,i tihink it does surely theres foggys but does anyone outside of my part of the word even within my city know about it or utilize their way of making things no i think the superhero genre in the mainstream is incrasibly stale and it something people look over even the term superheroe misfists defies they arent superheroes
television,not_removed,i think you are illustrating my point perfectly do you honestly think there arent foggys elsewhere i dont mean a place by that name but a local place you havent heard of that makes superior burgers its the same with most genres im sure youve encountered people who dismiss all anime because of their experiences with the lowest common denominator media that is deemed financially safe enough to spend money mass marketing a short list off the top of my head of smart and unique superhero showsmovies the middleman dr horribles singalong blog no heroics edge of tomorrow the watchmen the tick heat vision and jack
television,not_removed,third watch has some odd licensing issue so only like the first season or two were released
television,not_removed,well not sure if it counts as a drama but unsolved mysteries has been in dvd hell for a while now those full dvd collections are basically the holy grail for us over on runresolvedmysteries and runsolvedmysteries and cost about wherever you can get em amazon or ebay apparently whoever owns the rights is just really stingy about it and hasnt felt the need to release anything in years id gladly pay for a set of the entire series on bluray or hell even dvd at this point the show is nonexistent on streaming services and only airs an episode or so a day on the lifetime channel i believe
television,not_removed,karen sisco
television,not_removed,the lyons den mister sterling freedom new york undercover
television,not_removed,i have a season of that i managed to find at a pawn store i would love to have all of them such a great show
television,not_removed,so the rich and greedy today are not only hoarding food money and real estate but also content fiends 😒
television,not_removed,what did you like about it
television,not_removed,it really is a great show they really managed to make the boring parts of being a cop entertaining a show that was realistic in a lot of regards but also had good drama and occasionally some comedy great character development too i think they have the best presentation of any show too
television,not_removed,ive only seen one or two episodes of it but i really liked what i saw its a show based on some of elmore leonards work theres some strong dialogue and carla gugino is absolutely beautiful theres a few episodes on youtube
television,not_removed,oh screw off
television,not_removed,has this episode been released yet
television,not_removed,normally it airs weekly on thursdays but it seems like episode got released today on netflix
television,not_removed,american netflix sitting here crying in the uk because i cant watch episode and
television,not_removed,its tied to amazon on some devices you can download for offline viewing but in general you buy it and just stream it whenever you want
television,not_removed,are you talking about
television,not_removed,show is underrated
television,not_removed,ive bought a bunch of shows from amazon and ive always streamed them on my pc through the site or downloaded them to my phone via the app
television,not_removed,i bought new frontier from them long ago back when it was new so it was tied to amazon of course that was pre a lot of things
television,not_removed,i just buy everything off itunes ive had amazon prime since it came out and have yet to mess around with their video and just watch everything else on netflix
television,not_removed,yes thats what i mean sorry if i was unclear
television,not_removed,is it possible to download them onto my pc then hdmi it to my big screen
television,not_removed,no i was just making sure sounds like amazon video is the way to stream but this should be more clear i hope
television,not_removed,you can connect your pc to your tv using hdmi and then put the browser on the tv screen and stream it in full screen mode you cannot download the video file itself or if you have any modern game console streaming device or smart tv it will likely have an amazon video app
television,not_removed,my pc is connected to my tv so ive never had to try that ill be home in minutes and ill check it out
television,not_removed,sorry i forgot to check yesterday i just did and it looks like streaming is the only way to watch the video on my pc also i googled and found this
television,not_removed,i dunno about other shows but the mash dvds have the ability to turn off the laugh track it stands up quite well and i prefer it without the laugh track
television,not_removed,the shows were made to have room for laughter thats why it seems awkward in those youtube videos where they strip laughter they pause like all stage performers do i dont know why it is such a bad thing shows like seinfeld performed in front of an audience and i think were better off because of it would you want to watch a standup special without an audience shows with canned laughter like mash and the first season of sports night are exceptions though i wish sports night had an option to turn it off it seemed so tacked on
television,not_removed,no its part of the finalized episode that is available to whomever gets the right to show it or sell it there are versions of shows that are different for example sometimes shows will however be resold etc without certain music in them because for whatever reason they didnt get all the specific music rights they needed for resale or they may cut something in a specific episode for whatever number of reasons
television,not_removed,thats pretty cool i figured mash would be able to i just wouldnt see some without it being great i would assume seinfeld could too but theyre both classics
television,not_removed,it was abcs fault for having it on sports night i hope a reworked audio version would be out someday
television,not_removed,mash is actually much much better without the laugh track were constantly told that hawkeye is this mad lonely genius battling depression but in the broadcast versions hes constantly surrounded by laughter the silence makes it much more powerful it makes the writing and the delivery stand on its own
television,not_removed,httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvekvchqffww here is one of sorkins regular directors explaining sports night
television,not_removed,my favourite bit is jared faking acting awkward also jensen saying dont look at the camera
television,not_removed,great episode i love when they do episodes like this another great one is when dean gets ghost sickness
television,not_removed,this is absolutely my favorite episode the acting part has me laughing so hard i cant understand why people hate this show
television,not_removed,this is hands down one of my favorite episodes from the show i watch it from time to time amazing acting from them acting them but not them love it
television,not_removed,
television,not_removed,i am a big time micamigo
television,not_removed,i died when i watched the episode where dean is scared of everything this is a good one too lol im in tears
television,not_removed,the first were the best it almost seemed like they meant to stop at season but the network coerced them into stretching it how the heck do you top a war on satan
television,not_removed,the series ended with season and you cant convince me otherwise
television,not_removed,well at least i know not to spend time watching this and thats valuable in itself
television,not_removed,i hate this show so much
television,not_removed,ah yes yellow fever is one of the best monster of the week episodes
television,not_removed,my favorite is the ghostfacers episode
television,not_removed,dean saying that was scary cracks me up every time love that episode
television,not_removed,do people hate it
television,not_removed,some of chucks unreleased books got leaked online awhile back and theyve been airing tv adaptations of them on the cw but some people think its just fanfic
television,not_removed,it got renewed for a season
television,not_removed,it did ended we now watch a spin off show with sometimes cool scary awesomemeta adventures their is a lot to like im those adventures
television,not_removed,agreed
television,not_removed,haha thats exactly the scene my mind goes to when i think of this episode another good scene is his freak out about why their crazy cause they go after monsters
television,not_removed,just that its been driven into the ground going another seven seasons past its original arc set up by the shows creator who left after season five
television,not_removed,strange the series ended with season
television,not_removed,it really hasnt though the last season was great the people that say that are the ones that dont even watch it anymore and assume its the what the hivemind thinks which will get them approval
television,not_removed,funny as this was in season
television,not_removed,for you
television,not_removed,well i tapped out after the sixth season as it felt very derivative pointless that it was still going my main gripe is that the story clearly concluded they took it all back and completely destroyed every bit of stakes they accumulated by the fifth season ive been considering getting back into it because its a fun enough show and now with some distance it might not feel as repetitive even if it doesnt have any real stakes the general reception ive read though including reviews from critics seem to say all the same things that its repetitive as all hell is spinning its wheels i did hear good things about its latest season or at least that its the best since the fifth season
television,not_removed,that has nothing to do with peoples opinions of the show afterwards
television,not_removed,i strongly recommend the last season it felt like a return to its roots while i agree some series go way too long im still enjoying this show theres one episode that is purely through the perspective of their car and its amazing edit found it season episode baby one of my favorite episodes of the series
television,not_removed,i hope they retain the spirit of these characters from the movie and keep them totally oblivious to the supernatural
television,not_removed,best news of the day you like the pasghetti
television,not_removed,this pleases me
television,not_removed,for the record if someone had fucked my sandwich i would enjoy it even more
television,not_removed,werewolves not swearwolves
television,not_removed,also i had just heard in the nerdist podcast that the director is going to helming the next thor movieand then after that hell be directing the sequel to what we do in the shadows
television,not_removed,those cops were funny
television,not_removed,i hope this comes to netflix or syfy or there is some way for us yanks to watch this
television,not_removed,are they gona be the same cast
television,not_removed,i actually got to meet deacon and petyr a few weeks ago at a horror convention they stayed in character while signing autographs and during their entire q a panel they are seriously awesome and talented individuals
television,not_removed,please please let them release it in the states eventually netflix fodder
television,not_removed,i loved it thats great news
television,not_removed,if you are going to eat a sandwich you would just enjoy it more if you knew no one had fucked it
television,not_removed,the movie was good but i think a tv show will suck and get old quickly
television,not_removed,o might have a reason to turn on the tv then
television,not_removed,it would be cool if the premise were that the vampires were slowly turning back into human and the characters dont know how to feel about it they could begin dating using the internet and whatever else the modern human does
television,not_removed,i hope the it guy on set is a regular
television,not_removed,werent they only oblivious to everything because the vampires hypnotized them or did i miss something
television,not_removed,displeases me
television,not_removed,hahaha i remember that part from the movie too
television,not_removed,the director is going to helming the next thor movie they are already filming it and released a thor short using the mockumentary style of what we do in the shadows
television,not_removed,try your local library thats how in watched it
television,not_removed,i had it on for about seconds and switched it off and threw on hunt for the wilderpeople in anticipation for ragnarok wilderpeople was okay it had some cute and funny moments but what am i missing here is it because im american or because im not a movie buff or both
television,not_removed,i am wondering about that too because i love that cop she had the best deadpan delivery standing over the corpse of a hunter cop this guy isnt having a good time hes gonna feel terrible tomorrow morning decan well his soul is in hell so dont worry cop well i dont know where his soul is but all i am saying is where is his blanket
television,not_removed,its a sixepisode miniseries not a twentytwo episode american broadcast season i think that six episodes have more than enough to draw from to expand the universe a bit while still keeping things good
television,not_removed,or it could be a new buffy movie was good series was awesome
television,not_removed,they can do those things whilst still being vampire though
television,not_removed,theres an odd movie called freaks of nature with zombies and vampires coexisting with humans in a small town turns out if a zombie stops eating brains canned brains in the movie they start getting smarter not a perfect flick but i enjoyed its silliness
television,not_removed,they will tell him he is just there to compare the show to the movie and he will never guess that he is on the show or will he
television,not_removed,moss wasnt in what we do in the shadows
television,not_removed,you didnt i guess i just enjoyed that dynamic and hope its preserved in some way
television,not_removed,ill count it
television,not_removed,mmmmm i member
television,not_removed,i really do hate when threads like this pretty much ignore talking about the actual news its not quite happened but just reading quotes is rather boring
television,not_removed,also i think it was taika who tweeted a picture of thors hammer on a toilet seat lid caption thanks mate thanks a lot haha
television,not_removed,reminds of the british version of the office which im sure thats what they were going for
television,not_removed,are you from the future tell me how well the spidey movie goes down future boy
television,not_removed,the spin off hasnt even started filming yet so you have the best time machine ever
television,not_removed,not everyone enjoys the same things so you are not missing anything you just dont have the same sense of humor
television,not_removed,i hope thats true and that the original actors are in it too many episodes and seasons would ruin it much like the american version of the office
television,not_removed,being vampire helps them do their dark bidding on the internet
television,not_removed,theyre talking about stu who was the actual it guy for the set that they kinda tricked into becoming a big part of the movie
television,not_removed,ah gotcha yeah that joke is definitely good enough to carry on for a bit
television,not_removed,i remember dark bidding on a table
television,not_removed,member tatooine
television,not_removed,there are two versions of the office theres the office and theres the american office
television,not_removed,i know i was trying to spin it off into an it crowd reference but i guess i missed the landing
television,not_removed,ooohhhh i member member chewbacca again
television,not_removed,both of them hilarious
television,not_removed,no i think youre wrong theres the british office and then theres the good office
television,not_removed,i member member the
television,not_removed,member when marriage was only between a man and a woman
television,not_removed,no but member the tho
television,not_removed,please come back with your own show jon stewart youre our only hope
television,not_removed,how many of these shorts are there in total ive only seen a couple
television,not_removed,um since when were they in a dome
television,not_removed,since season
television,not_removed,december and they make an ad now
television,not_removed,ill give it a go why not
television,not_removed,i was curious how much this cost so i googled it
television,not_removed,rhmmm
television,not_removed,the aliens look like they came from defiance
television,not_removed,its my favorite cop show of all time not so fun fact the actor who played julien recently got years for killing his wife
television,not_removed,such a terrific show shane dropping that bag into hia partners lapthe whole shane and his family storyline at the endjust too much
television,not_removed,family meeting
television,not_removed,a great show one of my favorites and the best ending to a show ive seen for awhile and i like the direction of the show the handheld really put you right into the action also if you liked walton goggins shane check out justified he plays one of the best bad guys put on tv
television,not_removed,it really is amazing and it was funny seeing david acevada in battlefield hardline albeit that game was horrid it was funny seeing him play the cop again
television,not_removed,its one of the greatest television shows of all time and my personal favorite while i wouldnt argue that it is the greatest thats reserved for mad men the sopranos or the wire i do personally believe it ranks among them in fact id argue that its superior to breaking bad despite that it lacks the truly stellar direction of breaking bad its a better story its a better truer fuller tragedy
television,not_removed,one of my favorites it paved the way for the type of serialized drama we get on basic cable today and still holds up against all of them the ending is fantastic mackey loses everything his job power friends family respect freedom its the worst punishment he could receive from his point of view
television,not_removed,this thread reminds me that i need to do a rewatch of this show
television,not_removed,it was an awesome show one of my alltime favorites
television,not_removed,it was a great show the only things that are downsides is that the storytelling in the final couple of seasons felt so rushed because they still had to have a crimeoftheweek storyline even though the endgame was coming for vic and the strikeforce so vic was solving these crimes at breakneck speed and then he also had to squeeze people in order to get money or favors in order to cover other favors and it literally became a situation where vic busts through this gang hideout shoves a couple of guys around make a few threats and hes able to get info on where a big drug stash was going to be in under minutes and then he makes the biggest drug bust ever about an hour later and gives the evidence to somebody with the district attorneys office to get a favor to do a wiretap on somebodys phone so that he can do a whole bunch of other stuff and that would be one episode it was ridiculous no cop is that effective they literally had scenes in which vic is getting out of a car he tells ronnie all of this information in seconds and then says he needs to get across town to speak with his wife and the info dump is necessary to understanding how he accomplished all of this stuff the only other criticism i remember is that alot of the side characters stories simply faded off and those characters were just there for vic to interact with whenever the story required it but for its time and as one of fxs first shows ever it was pretty great
television,not_removed,i loved it need to do a rewatch season was probably my favorite i really enjoyed glenn close on the show while i found seasons could of been trimmed down into one season the ending was perfect
television,not_removed,ronny yelling you told them everything still sticks with me to this day vic basically sacrificed another persons life and most of his own in order to avoid jail and public judgement the shock and anger from the fbi lady too when she realizes she gave immunity to a truly terrible human being too
television,not_removed,it was entertaining and i liked the ending but overall it felt to me like it was trying way too hard to be gritty and tough and came off really cheesy instead granted i watched it right after watching the wire so anything comes up short in comparison
television,not_removed,where can i stream this
television,not_removed,im so sorry
television,not_removed,i would agree but only if we were in a universe where the wire didnt exist its definitely my second favorite one though yeah i saw that story about half way through watching the show the headline just said star of the shield found guilty of murder i was not expecting it to be him
television,not_removed,have you checked out southland it has a very similar feel to the shield
television,not_removed,true detective
television,not_removed,i havent seen it yet should i watch it what does this character shane drop onto his partners lap
television,not_removed,the ending was the best part i loved how it all played out ill check it out walton goggins was pretty great in the hateful also seeing him play a legit bad guy sounds great
television,not_removed,im actually excited to see him test out his comedy chops on vice principals too see if he can keep up with danny mcbrides ridiculousness
television,not_removed,thank you for the laugh
television,not_removed,exactly i remember spending seven years thinking there was no way i would be satisfied with the ending unless vic winds up in prison or dead and somehow that finale came and convinced me that there was something that for mackey would be much worse i love it
television,not_removed,yes the side characters definitely became pretty ancillary except for maybe dutchclaudettes storyline best example is juliens story they made such a big deal about him being a gay cop in the early seasons then once he gets married to that chick its like he lives happily ever after they never really show his outside life after you see him have to go to the sperm bank to impregnate his wife but then nothing just some random scenes of him lusting after dudes i dont know i was expecting something more to happen with that and ronnie lol hes literally just there to do what vic tells him
television,not_removed,the only other criticism i remember is that alot of the side characters stories simply faded off and those characters were just there for vic to interact with whenever the story required it yup it became pretty clear that after season two the shield had no idea what it wanted to do with its nonstrike team characters
television,not_removed,i like the wire better too by a lot i like to think that show is more based in reality and the shield is going for more of the you wont believe what crazy shit happens this episode angle
television,not_removed,i watched it all on hulu
television,not_removed,i love love love the wire but the shield takes top spot for me remember finally getting around to it and finishing the whole thing in less than a week not sure if i even went outside until it was done never got that deep into a bingewatch before or since
television,not_removed,in my opinion the shield ended stronger than the wire the shields final season is one of the strongest and the wires is the weakest also that ending of the shield was so good
television,not_removed,i just started watching southland i love a good cop drama but it definitely isnt as intense as the shield i am enjoying it with good character development so far though
television,not_removed,not that good tbh first half of td was amazing then second half was so dissapointing
television,not_removed,as far as a cop show goes no its a great mystery show but not an overall cop show
television,not_removed,ill say this this moment is the only point in any tv series that my dad has ever rang me on the phone about to be all like can you fucking believe this shit before that point i dont even remember him watching tv before you should watch the shield is basically what im saying
television,not_removed,i would watch it to find out
television,not_removed,watch itthe only way to find out
television,not_removed,its a top notch show dont spoil the plot twists and cliffhangers for yourself by asking too many questions just go watch it
television,not_removed,as others have refused to spoil it i cannot be the one to do so simply put the show is very surprising and amazing youll love it if you get hooked after the first episode
television,not_removed,yes leave this thread and go watch it before you spoil it for yourself
television,not_removed,of course you should watch it dont ask for spoilers go in blind
television,not_removed,a plane ticket
television,not_removed,agreed the ending catapulted the show that much further into greatness im always super critical of endings because it always feels like the writers get lazy in the home stretch and force an uninspired ending just to be done with it endings need the exact opposite of that they need to leave lasting impressions and pay respect to the story the shield had a beautiful and tragic ending that did just that
television,not_removed,the shield is actually based in the reality of a circa la anti gang division that went around doing pretty much what mackey and co did on the show
television,not_removed,this was me with southland i lost myself in that show
television,not_removed,not to mention the fact that the wire went on to become a story about a city and began to focus less and less on a police investigation as much as it was a story about baltimore itself the shield on the other hand was a cop show throughandthrough
television,not_removed,i know youre talking in reference to the overall quality of their respective final seasons but while season of the wire was easily the weakest season that final episode was so well done bubbles scene especially both shows finales are fantastic
television,not_removed,its definitely not as intense but there are still a lot of similarities and the show only improves as it goes on youll like it
television,not_removed,yeah the ending to the shield was a thing of magic it gave you just enough finality to be satisfied but tickled your imagination just enough to keep you guessing very few series have managed to gap that medium and its really what separates a good series from a great one
television,not_removed,well yeah im sure that an anti gang division in la definitely went around abusing people coercing confessions planting evidence all that jazz i just meant like the specific events that happen in the show seem borderline over the top like acevado having to suck that dudes dick or vic locking those two gangsters in a crate and leaving them to fight to the death
television,not_removed,southland is so damn good there are a few short scenes from up in the helicopter that really take me back to actually being a crew chief in a helo they were shot so well the whole show is amazing
television,not_removed,that one episodeyou know the one im talking about boy that was intense
television,not_removed,you should read up on the rampart scandal it wont seem so far fetched
television,not_removed,my leo friend says that too it was a very accurate depiction and the police characters were pretty true to department types
television,not_removed,i will
television,not_removed,i think that is why i like it so much there are so many subtle things that happen that they dont explain but someone that knows about it can pick up on it how they phrase a radio call or something there are subtle messages there that do mean something
television,not_removed,wikipedia
television,not_removed,i assume they mean without spoilers just a yes no for whether its a show that wraps up with an actual finale like the end of a book or just kind of stops do to being canceled on short notice or between seasons or whatever
television,not_removed,yeah it was an actual website with a fairly simple name toosomething like doesitresolvecom but that wasnt it and it just had a list of shows and said things like resolves doesnt resolve
television,not_removed,holy shit it was a subreddit all this time i was looking for a website thank you so much
television,not_removed,trump might appreciate bears piss drinking more
television,not_removed,to bad he found his way back
television,not_removed,im not a fan of the show but i have it on in the background because midnight comes on right after it but it does seem like every episode is lets see what white people did that we can bitch about im all for equal rights i just thought it was kind of bullshit in tonights episode when larry was talking about the hashtag hetero pride parade thing and brought up the other stupid hashtags like hashtag all lives matter then he said hashtag shut the fuck up like why is he so mad about all lives matter larry doesnt really seem to be talking about equality as much as hes saying if youre not fully supporting what this minority group is doing at the moment then shit the fuck up i know people have other ways of looking at it but thats just how i see it also larry wilmore just isnt funny at all
television,not_removed,it was originally going to be called the minority report so take that as you wish
television,not_removed,been that way since the beginning seemed more lighthearted with the schtick on the daily show but not so much on the nightly show
television,not_removed,episode
television,not_removed,oh look its that time of day you are pissed black people get to watch a show more relevant to their interests why does that upset you so
television,not_removed,you sound triggered do you need a safe space
television,not_removed,
television,not_removed,there are genuine issues with all lives matter because it undercuts the very point of black lives matter in a cynical way and i appreciate that some people are coming from a genuine place but the effect is the same black lives matters doesnt mean only black lives matter it means black lives matter too and it was addressing specific cases of police impunity with regard to killing young black men and not being punished at all
television,not_removed,why is it relevant to black peoples interest to complain about white people
television,not_removed,i guess its us versus them
television,not_removed,keep trolling stormfront
television,not_removed,did you watch his bit on bill cosby or ben carson the only white people thing is wrong
television,not_removed,and what about a white people channel am i right jesus christ are you people predictable
television,not_removed,larry wilmore is racist
television,not_removed,this is rtelevision not stormfront
television,not_removed,he didnt talk about bill cosby or ben carson last night
television,not_removed,is there some white channel where white people complain about black people ive watched the nightly show since it started but its just completely turned into black people complaining about white people for the whole show which is boring as hell
television,not_removed,you think theres a difference these days
television,not_removed,oh no this is horrible there are other races out there or people interested in diversity what has this world come to
television,not_removed,fox news
television,not_removed,this is why we cant have discussions about race if you disagree with my claim prove im wrong
television,not_removed,black people who they complain about hilary clinton
television,not_removed,what discussions if youre angry that a show talks about other races than just white people problems that does make you a racist
television,not_removed,for those unsure astro or xenomycology is the study of alien fungi
television,not_removed,will this actually go forward after voyager if not its lame star trek is about going forward
television,not_removed,so a captain an alien and a astromycologist walk into a bar
television,not_removed,spengler i collect spores and fungi
television,not_removed,takes place before tos after enterprise
television,not_removed,you must be a real fungi d
television,not_removed,
television,not_removed,this one i say give about four episodes i mean if you find yourself outright hating it then just walk away but if you think theres something there then hang in for the first four i think they give you a very good idea of what it has to offer
television,not_removed,nope the plot is only barely passable and the acting doesnt help
television,not_removed,only the first and second seasons after that it just gets repetitive and ridiculous
television,not_removed,you should probably just watch the first season after that its up to you imo the quality drops after the end of season but thats just me
television,not_removed,yes its awesome it gets a bit out there by season but the character remain fun and interesting its one of the best ensemble on tv that i have seen to this day a lot of memorable and likeable characters despite them being criminals i dont really know what is goofy about it maybe you are just not used to how network tv was
television,not_removed,stranger things toast of london all the marvel netflix shows spartacus eastbound and down breaking bad battlestar galactica doctor who peep show trailer park boys just off the top of my head those are the shows ive seen in the past decade that have done something interesting and different while sustaining their qualities in some meaningful ways prison break sits alongside heroes and dexter and ultimately true blood theyre not essential viewing in theyre increasingly bizarre artifacts of an absurd transition humanity went through on its way to an even more bonkers one i mean watch away but theres sooooo much better shit out there
television,not_removed,i know what youre saying seems cheesy right i couldnt even finish the first season lincoln is supposed to die like five times and narrowly escapes by milliseconds each time whether its by interference or dumb luck it takes the whole season for them to actually get out with like three failed attempts cliffhangers at every break and at the end of every episode some of the ways michael gets in contact with his brother requires huge suspension of disbelief i tried to like it and i wanted to like it but it just fell apart very quickly
television,not_removed,no
television,not_removed,no
television,not_removed,hey for a gimmick show about an elaborate prison break and conspiracies to stay coherent until the fourth season is a testament to its quality and even season four had its ups if you completely throw plausibility out the window and if you managed to watch until then youre way past the window now
television,not_removed,what else do you recommend i watch seen breaking bad dexter the office and my name is earl loved them all
television,not_removed,reasoning
television,not_removed,reasoning
television,not_removed,sling tv now has the nfl network and redzone
television,not_removed,i havent had cable for the last years or so i have everything i want on netflix hulu and hbo go my current roommate bought an antenna for the tv in the living room and aside from the olympics no one has switched over to the tv
television,not_removed,i probably dont need cable either but i already have the cable package including sho and hbo i buy nfl sunday ticket and nba league pass for sports there is better call saul on amc keeping me hooked
television,not_removed,there are lots of article about the cord cutters leaving are there any articles about how many come back
television,not_removed,i cut it years ago i pay for internet get all broadcast with an antenna i subscribe to hbo now for months during game of thrones i purchase the full current season of walking dead for for the entire season on amazon instant vids i do the same for orphan black and better call saul i had amazon prime and netflix when i had cable so im not counting that but i essentially pay about per month for all my internet and tvmovies
television,not_removed,even with three services thats still less than probably less than cable tv service and you dont have to worry about being charged for returned cable boxes or getting put in collections now we just need the govt to make internet a public utility to end the monopoly of comcast att and time warner
television,not_removed,the jerry part gets me every time
television,not_removed,just yesterday one of my coworkers didnt know there were days in march i immediately thought of this episode
television,not_removed,first episode i ever watched all the way through about weeks ago and have been binge watching since
television,not_removed,does he not have a pulse or not have a brain or either what is he
television,not_removed,have to stay loyal to my hbo game of thrones westworld silicon valley the night of the leftovers to name a few crashing is also fun and the return of larry in new curb will be amazing i cant wait
television,not_removed,hbo then fx lets not dethrone the gold standard of tv yet
television,not_removed,of my favorite shows of all time the shield and justified aired on fx one of my current runners for potential favorite show of all time is airing there now legion
television,not_removed,ive been binging the shield and fx has been doing it right for a while now apparently
television,not_removed,man all this talk about fx and no one has mentioned justified that show is criminally underrated
television,not_removed,fx may not have the budget for something like game of thrones or westworld but the way fx allows their showrunners the freedom to create interesting and fresh stories is why fx is my favorite network
television,not_removed,fx has been the best for years fargobasketsacsahslegionthe americanstaboo and atlanta along with iasipman seeking women and youre the worst on fxx whats not to love
television,not_removed,fx has such an amazing track record look at their history to now just off the top of my head the shield niptuck rescue me its always sunny in philadelphia sons of anarchy archer the league justified louie american horror story the americans fargo the strain baskets american crime story atlanta legion taboo
television,not_removed,honestly the leftovers got and westworld alone give hbo the nod fx is
television,not_removed,fxs the shield is the greatest show of all time michael chiklis is an american treasure
television,not_removed,starz has quickly risen up as well with black sails while i had no interest in that show aside from oggling some of the hot pirates when american gods starts starz will be in my top networks for sure
television,not_removed,i agree with op on this hbo has some really great shows too but they are all clumped together so there are seasons of the year when i dont need to watch hbo fx pretty much as at least one good show on all year
television,not_removed,just throwing it out there as its only one show but colony is incredible usa is doing top notch television and too many people are missing it seriously watch this show usa has stepped its game up and that trackingcombat shot in tonights episodeholy shit
television,not_removed,if only fx now actually worked and didnt crash every time i try to watch a show also the amount of commercials they show on that app is ridiculous
television,not_removed,id probably go with netflix if we can consider that a channel
television,not_removed,i was talking to a friend the other week and mentioned how fx is up there with premium cable networks like hbo and said no its arguably better after thinking about it i have to agree hbo has game of thrones westworld silicon valley veep fx has legion the americans archer atlanta fargo iasip american crime story baskets and taboo and american horror story if youre into that still fx is knocking it out of the fucking park and i gotta say its probably due to their head of programming the americans has never been a majorly viewed show but its been a hugely critical success and imo the best drama on tv right now the head of fx recognizes great tv when he sees it and lets them continue even if theyre not bringing in millions of viewers they treat their viewers well
television,not_removed,what the cw is tops all the fun shows are there
television,not_removed,i dont think so hbo is still the best got leftovers westworld is untouchable quality vs quantity although i think fx is second
television,not_removed,are you implying scifis shilling isnt godtier
television,not_removed,unfortunately man seeking woman is done youre the worst is still kicking though
television,not_removed,are you me
television,not_removed,for allaround depth of quality tv id have to agree hbo does well but they just dont have the sheer output of good stuff
television,not_removed,its not but it might be the best channel on basic cable
television,not_removed,lets not forget louie
television,not_removed,feud with susan sarandon and jessica lange is great too
television,not_removed,hbo is ahead game of thronesveep silicon valley are umatchable although fx is ahead of netflix in terms of quality
television,not_removed,fx definitely has a great lineup and i enjoy how varied and experimental that lineup is becoming but i have to give credit to hbo laying the groundwork first and are still pretty much knocking it out of the park after all this time if hbo didnt find that modicum of success via risk through the sopranos the wire satc curb etc while also refusing advertising and producing great documentaries and comedy specials im sure we wouldnt have as much diverse thoughtful content as we do now but as far as right now goes fx might have a stronger lineup i agree im curious to see what hbo will do once got is done
television,not_removed,hbo has boobs lawyered
television,not_removed,youre right that its not even close they have something for everyone too and it goes back years the americans fargo sons of anarchy atlanta the strain american horror story justified always sunny the league american crime story legion niptuck the riches louie all of them are or were insanely popular and pretty well made shows
television,not_removed,game of thrones westworld veep silicon valley last week tonight curb the night of the leftovers hbo is better and to say fx is the best and its not even close is just insanity and completely pandering for karma
television,not_removed,dont forget taboo between that and legion fx is killing it this season
television,not_removed,well showtime has the grand daddy of all shows now edit i meant twin peaks
television,not_removed,no love for amc
television,not_removed,meh ive never seen any of their shows none of them seem that appealing
television,not_removed,i try to avoid giving any moneytime i have to anything related with fox network its pretty hard but so far im surviving
television,not_removed,big little lies too
television,not_removed,veep as well
television,not_removed,animals is actually hilariously bizarre and refreshing its probably not for everyone but ive actually really enjoyed it and its second season quietly started again a couple of weeks ago
television,not_removed,i think the leftovers just might be the best show on tv
television,not_removed,meh got is almost done and while westworld silicon valley veep et al are great shows i dont think any of them hold a candle to legion fargo atlanta asaip etc hbo invented quality television but they arent at the top any more
television,not_removed,but its not tv its hbo
television,not_removed,hbo is great but its not at the top of its game anymore ten years ago when they were running the wire the sopranos six feet under etc i would agree with you but not today currently hbo has game of thrones only episodes remaining westworld no new episodes in curb your enthusiasm no new episodes since the leftovers in its final season veep and silicon valley theyre good shows but fx is absolutely killing it right now
television,not_removed,gotta agree ive been really impressed with a handful of shows on fx legion the americans fargo and theyve been churning out new shows like crazy but they also have some stinkers as well not necessarily in production quality but more so in terms of writing and content american horror story comes to mind i havent found a single show on hbo that i didnt find to be top notch in both writing and quality also im speaking mostly about dramas since i dont watch too many comedies but hbo has silicon valley and veep which are both exceptional
television,not_removed,if we are looking at the total body of work both have released to date sure however if we are just looking at currently airing shows then assuming fxx is included i think fx might win its pretty close though and would likely depend on a persons personal taste drama wise im not sure which i would pick over the americans and fargo or game of thrones and westworld legion for fx and the leftovers for hbo are also both supposed to be good but i havent seen either yet so i cant judge true detective while season was great season was weak comedy wise though silicon valley veep and girls are all goodless so on the last than the first two but i still like it and curb has another season soon but hasnt had one in years but fxfxx has louie atlanta sunny archer and youre the worst i havent seen vice principles or any of the other newer hbo comedies or baskets or man seeking women for fx so again cant judge those from the ones i watch while both are great fx wins this one for me
television,not_removed,my favorite show of all time is justified and im binge watching the shield right now about to start on season boyd crowder and raylan givens are the best television characters ever imo
television,not_removed,yup shield into sons into justified into americans side roads off into ahs terriers baskets andthe riches iirc also damages
television,not_removed,one of my favorite shows ever its a crime how little its being mentioned and im so glad fx allowed it to keep running even after a little bit of a rocky first season
television,not_removed,maybe because its ended but holy shit love that show it shows how good cop shows can be when you give a shit about creating a setting and developing characters
television,not_removed,the quality of got and a few comedies puts fx far behind hbo sunny archer fargo taboo legion baskets and man seeking woman dont at least keep it close unless you dont watch most of those fx shows i dont watch got and it doesnt taint my views on hbos quality but fx has a strong lineup and has quantity of shows to complement the quality of them
television,not_removed,archer
television,not_removed,people still dont realise that taboo was a bbc production
television,not_removed,how can neither of you mention louie
television,not_removed,i knew i was forgetting some
television,not_removed,feud is great too
television,not_removed,yeah its kinda insulting op said other networks are not even close
television,not_removed,certainly managed the best finale its a fucking masters course in how finales are done
television,not_removed,starzs magnum opus is still spartacus but outlander is pretty good too
television,not_removed,dont forget girlfriend experience and ash starz has been doing very well recently
television,not_removed,they rose up with black sails then cancelled it all theyve got left is ash vs evil dead and once they can that one too ill be done with them
television,not_removed,i just watched it it was good as an added treat i totally thought tonight was the finale im so happy they will wrap the season up
television,not_removed,hbo has game of thrones westworld silicon valley veep the leftovers will be back shortly
television,not_removed,cant tell if trolling
television,not_removed,they have a lot of fun shows and things like riverdale and crazy ex girlfriend actually surprised me with their quality i dont think theyre the best channel on right now but they have solid lineup of shows
television,not_removed,the cw is the best at what its trying to be which is scorchingly hot people doing hot people things riverdale supernatural vampire diaries gossip girl etc
television,not_removed,nah mate most of them are pretty trashy
television,not_removed,nah mate most of them are pretty trashy
television,not_removed,you dropped legion why its just finished and the finale was fantastic
television,not_removed,big little lies completely took me by surprise my wife watched while i read but i kept peeking over the book now im hooked right in time for it to end
television,not_removed,westworld isnt quite quality though theres amazing visuals but the characters are lacking depth and the show relies too heavily on mysteries and twists that havent all paid off got ends in years and the leftovers is in its final year same with girls hbo really needs to step it up with new quality programming
television,not_removed,yeah but got is almost over then what have you got
television,not_removed,gt someone gives their opinion gt you say their opinion in insanity and fishing for karma gt you then give your opinion and state is as though its a fact and no actually hbo isnt clearly better fx has so many great shows that they literally had to create a new channel just to be able to air all of them when you factor in the significant budget and name recognition head start hbo has had and you look at fxfxxs current list of shows the americans legion fargo american crime story baskets atlanta better things was okay sunny man seeking woman youre the worst archer and some recently ended shows like justified and hell even sons of anarchy yeah i think that for as much as i like hbo fx has a clear edge over the eight shows you listed one of which is an ended miniseries as a network as a whole
television,not_removed,taboo was a bbc show fx just distributed it in na
television,not_removed,but hbo and fx have other good shows too sho barely has twin peaks homeland and like one more show
television,not_removed,uhhhhh i mean fx makes a broad amount of shows im sure theres something for you and you wont know until you actually watch one
television,not_removed,what why
television,not_removed,found the guy who doesnt know how media corporations work
television,not_removed,asaip leftovers is easily better than west world or got
television,not_removed,jesse thicc
television,not_removed,how far did you watch season was fine but is amazing
television,not_removed,well the amc we know now exists because they picked up shows that hbo said no to side note of which they had nothing to do with during the production either otherwise if it wasnt for these shows you still would never have heard of this station and theyd be playing westerns during primetime still
television,not_removed,i think the gap between the two networks is small and its hard to say who is ahead but you left some really important shows and mini series for hbo off that list little big lies and show me a hero arewere fantastic the night of was a solid effort too then as far as shows go the leftovers is a television like so so good comedy wise vice principles is pretty great then there is high maintenance which is a criminally underrated show imo its a super creative structure they use to tell very good little short stories fx has some fantastic programming but they have some consistently mediocre stuff too hbo is much more consistent with quality imo even if it caters to more niche audiences with some shows
television,not_removed,dude the leftovers might be in its final season but its probably the best show on television imo game of thrones has seasons left and is a cultural phenomenon thats also a toptier quality show as well westworld will have new episodes in and hbo is known for taking their time with productions plus they have amazing miniseries like big little lies the night of and the young pope and im sure well get another new longform series by the end of that will be topnotch like the others
television,not_removed,hbo docs consistently puts out some of the best documentaries being made
television,not_removed,no new westworld in is nuts did they not even plan for a second season
television,not_removed,you just listed some the current hbo shows which are many of hbos greatest achievements and some of the greatest achievements in the history of tv hbo today is the best it has ever been
television,not_removed,hbo also has good limited series and their own movies that have been great they also have some great nonscripted shows too last week tonight is a really well made show despite the bias and john oliver sucking at delivering jokes vice and bill maher are also good the whole debate of hbo vs fx is moot because like when arguing which tv show is the best which network is the best is still subjective i think its more fruitful to argue that its one of the best rather then the best because youll get a better consensus its really hard to argue which network is better unless we decide on some metric and say its the best in that respect
television,not_removed,true hbo didnt have competition with netflix or amazon back then ten years ago hbo would have only had competition with showtime for this type of content what fx is doing is really impressive considering they dont have the budget of netflix or hbo
television,not_removed,i think youre really discounting the impact of game of thrones i think its a show that seems to have changed the course of of other networks in general maybe it was just the timing of the shows release but soon after game of thrones exploded other networks started redoubling their efforts in big budgetscope tv dramas
television,not_removed,failing to list the leftovers makes this entire comment invalid tbh
television,not_removed,so youll use ahs to shit on fx but youll just ignore that hbo aired true blood for like seasons or entourage for or girls for and plenty of other shows that arent necessarily bad but not top notch as you suggested luck hung lucky louie carnivale how to make it in america in treatment john from cincinnati vinyl the newsroom treme true detective season bored to death the brink hello ladies doll em rome family tree looking togetherness getting on hbos had some great shit over the years but their record isnt immaculate
television,not_removed,girls that one show with the talking animals that show with the rock and so much more are def not top notch
television,not_removed,man get to season of shield its the best finale i ever seen on tv episodes till the finale of six feet under so it may change considering all the hype
television,not_removed,mine too it really picked up after those first episodes or so and then the second season was just phenomenal
television,not_removed,it was so well put together the dialogue alone is so damn good im torn between wishing it had gone on longer and being happy that it didnt drag on too long
television,not_removed,he means overallas in all the shows that hbo aired and have since endedsuch as the sopranosthe wiresix feet underdeadwoodromeboardwalk empire etc
television,not_removed,hbo was sitting on top way back in the tales from the crypt days deadwood carnivale rome hbo has canceled shows on par with the best fx has aired but thats frankly just a function of budget and age in recent years if i had to choose i might choose fx and thats sayin somethingmainly saying that justified is a better show than game of thrones
television,not_removed,it was coproduced with fx its just as much fxs as it bbcs its not like a show like sherlock or dr who where the bbc owns the show and just has another network distribute it in the us
television,not_removed,because technically louie is donelouis has said he has somewhat moved on from the character and i only listed current running shows but yah louie is probably one of ny favorite shows
television,not_removed,should i give spartacus a shot
television,not_removed,ash
television,not_removed,they rose up with spartacus and decided to end it then they continued their rise with black sails and even outland and ash vs the evil dead again they decided to end black sails id say its slightly different to cancellation personally im excited to see where they go next american gods should be good but im unsure how they would get too many seasons content out of it but im excited to see them try
television,not_removed,im outright shocked how good this show for coming out of usa i would love to see whats happening in the world outside the colonies
television,not_removed,and curb your enthusiasm maybe the funniest show ever returns this year
television,not_removed,crazy exgirlfriend jane the virgin are complicated award winning dramedies also to some extent izombie the are pretty great
television,not_removed,maybe theyre a year old girl
television,not_removed,izombie all the dc shows its great for those who are burned out on the seriousness of modern tv
television,not_removed,crazy ex girlfriend is toptier tv
television,not_removed,arguing which one is the best is as pointless as arguing if dc or marvel is better its all subjective the only real thing you can try to prove is which one is making more money but that doesnt really make one better than the other because its all subjective everyone is just name droping shows they really like which means nothing to the opposite side because they came in liking their list more being able to name drop more shows isnt very objective either because it doesnt take into account the quality of the shows which is subjective also another thing is both networks have different strategies hbo is a little more diverse than fx they have nonscripted talk shows standup etc hbo only allocates late sunday night for scripted tv so will always have significantly less shows than two channels that show new shows multiple nights a week
television,not_removed,in both numbers and quality fx is definitely better than hbo hbo just has much higher bugeted shows which is great visually but look at something like legion and its doing some amazing fucking shit that no other show on tv is doing right now i love me some game of thrones and have nothing against hbo but its cute to see people list like shows some of them being season miniseries and try to compare that to the shows that fx has going on currently hbo used to be the go to but competition is rising amongst networks and thats a good thing they need to step up their game if they want to maintain the spot
television,not_removed,without twin peakstv wouldnt have been what it is now
television,not_removed,idk man i tend to like shows that are a bit more women centric ensemble casts and i like scifidystopianpost apocolyptic stuff none of them seem to fit
television,not_removed,only a few episodes into season but the final season previews look good
television,not_removed,that sounds exactly like it means amc is what it is today because of hbo
television,not_removed,which shows walking dead mad men halt and catch fire
television,not_removed,dont forget crashing it airs on hbo and its one of the best new shows ive seen in a while
television,not_removed,how is vice principals not on your lists
television,not_removed,veep is also perhaps the funniest show on tv and curb your enthusiasm one of the funniest shows in history has finished filming their next season
television,not_removed,also season of true detective pls pizza dont fuck it up
television,not_removed,thank you for your leftovers comment absolutely adore that show cannot wait fir the final season
television,not_removed,theres the deuce coming this summer
television,not_removed,dont forget silicon valley curb your enthusiasm and high maintenance
television,not_removed,see this is always an unpopular opinion but i think got is pretty low notch these days and westworld though the plot is fricking amazing doesnt have that many incredible characters other than dr ford and that assistant who turned out to be a host though the twist was kinda expected for me i didnt actually like the other characters all that much millay was nice and i liked doloress relationship with her father and that creep and i love q and okay i take that back i do love westworld but i stand by my opinion on game of thrones it used to be a hell of an experience for me now i feel its just a poor mans version of rome no complaints about the leftovers though
television,not_removed,the leftovers is very polarizing some people love it and others hate it not a good barometer for the overall quality of a channel
television,not_removed,yeah this is huge so many people forget the docs and nonfiction stuff hbo does that is so great
television,not_removed,just a longer development time i mean fargo on fx airs a new season every months the last season having run from october to december of some shows are just transitioning to longer development time which if that allows for consistent quality by all means ill wait so far its worked for fargo well see if it works again for them as well as for westworld
television,not_removed,i love those shows but even id say the wirethe sopranos era is better
television,not_removed,the production quality might be the best but the actual best shows were a decade earlier
television,not_removed,did you read the list i said the leftovers in its final season
television,not_removed,mostly agree with your point but some of those were at least critically top notch if not received by audiences as such rome carnivale and treme were all highly rated and amazing shows in my book
television,not_removed,entourage was great for what it was
television,not_removed,carnivale was amazing other than ending to soon i also really liked rome how to make it in america and bored to death but i agree not everything hbo has ever aired has been top tier
television,not_removed,true blood was solid for the first seasons
television,not_removed,theyre not top notch but i do enjoy both animals and ballers for what they are animals is brilliant and i love all the voice cameos they get
television,not_removed,i am the target demographic for ballers and i hate that show
television,not_removed,the brink case closed
television,not_removed,and if boyd and raylan arent the best characters on television i dont know who is
television,not_removed,i wish it were still around but it really did go out at the perfect time had enough time to explore the characters but left you wanting more and that last line wow
television,not_removed,i have a feeling its going to be like curb its just gunna come back out of nowhere
television,not_removed,i highly recommend it but youll have to stick with it because the first few episodes are a little rough as they havent quite figured out their style or how to use green screen properly
television,not_removed,ash vs evil dead
television,not_removed,ive never actually really watched that show only caught some episodes here and there its kind of daunting when something has been running for so many years
television,not_removed,i agree but twin peaks alone doesnt do anything to make showtime amazing
television,not_removed,thats a pretty tiny niche if you want to hit all three continuum and the are the only ones that come to mind right now expanse maybe i admit they dont really do sf right now its never a big is that really the only genre you appreciate not trying to attack just seems none of the networks will cater to this beyond one show or so
television,not_removed,you should watch colony on usa
television,not_removed,than your complaint is more about preference than quality i think
television,not_removed,women centric watch the americans then
television,not_removed,please tell me youre watching the
television,not_removed,season felt entirely different but needed season highly recommend binging
television,not_removed,mad men and breaking bad were written and made for hbo which ended up turning them down during the process and then amc ended up picking up the distro rights and the production companies did the shows themselves it wasnt an entirely normal process to my understanding this gets a little complicated but suffice it to say that amc didnt really interact with these shows they just owned their tv distribution rights sony has tried many times to get the word out that bb was their show but to little public avail the walking dead was also supposed to be hbo but things just werent working out it bounced around a while on the premiums and such and amc then got involved in it and pushed it forward this is their thing unlike the ones above that werent they just distributed those mostly
television,not_removed,it has that unending optimism that is something a lot of shows now dont have its been funny and sweet and sad and pete just anchors it so well i really into it
television,not_removed,yes good addition it really is good way better than i expected apatow and pete holmes seem to mix really well
television,not_removed,crashing yes but the person i was responding to listed veep and silicon valley and i was making a list of showsmini series they didnt credit hbo with
television,not_removed,hahaha what a funny show eastbound and down is one of my all time faves so obviously i dig vice principles
television,not_removed,has summer been confirmed for that to air
television,not_removed,i agree got feels like it took a massive hit in quality after
television,not_removed,the same with both game of thrones and westworld i really love game of thrones and think the complaints against it are lame but even after watching the entire first season of westworld i just wasnt into it neither the mysteries nor the characters were compelling enough hbo produces very pretty shows but the writing isnt always at the top of its game
television,not_removed,fargo isnt a fair comparison the seasons arent a singular narrative like westworld will be true detective is a better comparison
television,not_removed,its pretty hard to argue against the wire and sopranos but overall id say theyre doing even better now the leftovers it up there with anything and got and ww are both great then you have the first season of true detective oneoff seasons like the night of and a whole host of critically acclaimed documentaries and comedies maybe the combo of those shows will never be topped but theyre pumping out good content like never before
television,not_removed,i cant agree but that maybe because i dont like the genre of those two shows
television,not_removed,entourage was great in the first few seasons then it just being the physical manifestation of a masturbatory motion
television,not_removed,wat lena always had the reins in the first season she was literally writer or cowriter of every episode
television,not_removed,so it started just like black sails
television,not_removed,agree with you too i just wanted to show off twin peaks d too excited for the return
television,not_removed,i forgot about that show it looked boring but i might check it out one day
television,not_removed,it doesnt have to hit all those niches lol i do love the tho unsurprisingly i like a lot of different shows like shameless twd black mirror the leftovers bates motel etc etc but all the fx shows seem really male centric and i think legion is scifi
television,not_removed,i tried that but i couldnt get past like episode when does it get good in your opinion
television,not_removed,i know
television,not_removed,girl im all over that ish lol i havent watched yet but im going to binge it soon
television,not_removed,wow kind of surprised im getting downvoted on my original comment for having an opinion
television,not_removed,sony should have retitled it sonys breaking bad if they wanted the mainstream credit for it
television,not_removed,i wonder what twd would be like if it had ended up on hbo
television,not_removed,written maybe but fx actually paid for the pilot of breaking bad
television,not_removed,interesting thanks for clarifying
television,not_removed,it bounced around a while on the premiums and such and dont forget nbc tried to make it into a procedural
television,not_removed,are you suggesting they shot pilots for those two and then amc swooped in and grabbed already produced shows after hbo passed because that did not happen also sony is the studio and amc is the network this is how nearly every show on tv works
television,not_removed,i remember one of the networks actually wanted to make walking dead a procedural show set during the zombie apocalypse makes me wonder if terra nova was supposed to be something better than it was
television,not_removed,that was last i heard via some article not sure theres been an official date announcement direct from hbo tho
television,not_removed,i felt like season was the beginning of the fall tbh it had the best moments to adapt and it delivered on a lot of them but it was the first season with obviously terrible moments this includes the spoilers for anyone else reading attempted rescue of theon the complete turn of shaes character that wasnt very wellexecuted season is probably the best season imo season had some of the best moments of the show and so did season but there are just so many scenes that seem so loweffort and thrown in
television,not_removed,why is this downvoted lol season had arya and the hounds adventures the mountain v viper fight tyrions trial battle for the wall purple wedding and tyrion killing tywin it was my favorite season of tv of all time and then was followed by a season that had good moments in episodes hardhome and jon getting betrayed and a season that could have cut every episode but the last and lost very little
television,not_removed,im on board with you westworld is pretty soulless and bad
television,not_removed,im not sure how the narrative structure matters as american horror story an anthology series is still yearly and considering the anthology series brings in a whole new cast schedule conflicts should be even less of an issue
television,not_removed,the leftovers takes months between seasons too
television,not_removed,there was a year when hbo had rome sopranos six feet under wire and deadwood all airing no channel will ever have that much top notch programming at once if you like leftovers youd probably like six feet under if you havent already seen it
television,not_removed,black sails got better after the first half of but sparactus is like objectively terrible for eps but why the end of its already great
television,not_removed,i can only wonder if by season this exact thing didnt come up in an executive meeting leslie hey bob cant we just change the name bob holy shit thats a good idea leslie lets get legal on this but to no avail
television,not_removed,hbo probably wouldnt have slashed the budget after a record breaking first season in fact they and most channels wouldve probably increased the budget like they did with got probably wouldnt have lost darabont as a result as well i enjoy the walking dead i think its fun schlock but i think there was an opportunity for it to be genuinely great and amc just intentionally fucked it up to save some bucks
television,not_removed,these shows had an awkward spring to life and production situation as compared to more normal setups and bounced around probably in part to their strange setup and amc recent move to acquire this type of programming and a dozen other things that wont be made public going on bts bb was particularly weird if you read some of the other comments and sony even was going to move it off amc at one point around season because amcs rights were expired and they were gonna shop it amc and they eventually made a deal this is not unlike the netflixhouse of cards debacle the history of these two shows is just a cool abnormal thing
television,not_removed,hbo passed on those shows way before the pilot stage giligan pitched breaking bad but hbo declined other networks passed too like fx i dont even think hbo gave weiner a meeting despite him being a sopranos writer weiner actually pitched the script all around hollywood and amc was the only network interested
television,not_removed,but there arent any police crime scenes or court rooms during a zombie apocalypse i hear that a lot but it sounds like an internet rumor since the logistics dont really exist especially since the walking dead was already a long running comic book with tons of content
television,not_removed,it matters because if you have a tv show with a million budget you should have some plans for the second season
television,not_removed,yeah i cant really argue with that thats a ridiculous lineup though i feel like the wire is what pushes it over the edge right now you have the leftovers which is probably as good as anything not named the wire you also have got ww veep silicon valley the night of season of true detective and a lot of other stuff thats highly praised that has to be the best year as far a sheer prestige tv goes but right now may be even better as far as variety goes at the end of the day hbo keeps delivering in spades i havent seen six feet under but its been on my backlog forever some day soon hopefully
television,not_removed,given that they kept it going for six seasons it looks like hbo was ok with it being weird
television,not_removed,thanks for this info what exactly is fargo the americans is on my list to watch eventually
television,not_removed,to be fair hbo specifically passed on it because they did not want it to have as much violence as it did so they did themselves in on that one amc as much as i despise the way they ended up treating twd allowed darabont to make the show the way he wanted obviously just for season once they realized the cash cow they had on their hands with the ratings bonanza of the first season amc execs meddled into the affair with their grubby hands and squeezed that cow for every single penny
television,not_removed,while its cool its surprisingly not that abnormal definitely not common but stuff like this happens more than most people would think i actually just did a show with sony that was in a three way competition between different networks amc being one of them networks will acquire scripts and then pass on them often amc does this a lot in fact all networks do sometimes those shows get resurrected at a new network sneaky pete even shot a pilot and then got passed on i think it was abc then sony took it back out and sold it to hulu its more common to happen at the script development level than at the pilot level but it definitely happens to at least a couple shows every year no one knows about it because those shows generally still dont get to air of shows never get a series pick up
television,not_removed,world war z was already a ridiculously popular book and the movie still went a completely different direction with it i imagine it would have been the walking dead in name only
television,not_removed,quiet frankly i wouldnt be surprised if that budget is part of the reason why they have it coming back in considering the budgetary spending going on with got right now to bring that to a close over these next two year but regardless what does the budget have to do with anything this is what was worked out between the showrunners and hbo they plan not to come back for over a year if thats due either to how costly the show is or because they need to time to build and structure their plan as well as actually execute it to be of such high quality then that isnt a problem just means you need to be patient besides westworld isnt the only project these people work on
television,not_removed,they said they wanted to take the time to have a tightly written season jonathan nolan thought there were some times in season where production was catching up to the writing which is why production shut down for a few weeks so that they could punch up the last few episodes which were an improvement on the season imo hbos willing to allow this type of stuff now after admitting they rushed true detective season
television,not_removed,excellent series imo it is an anthology series so every season is its own story it is inspired by the coen brothers movie of the same name but draws its own story basically a crime story in a small town in minnesota with great characters and actors the season is one complete story so no procedural it has a very unique and compelling style and is all round quality tv might start a bit on the slow side but absolutely worth it and i agree with the former post there are great female characters in both season that help cary the show id argue the protagonist of the first season is the bad ass female policeman officer
television,not_removed,right it would definitely have had to change drastically from the source material but procedural dramas are shows centered around solving crimes or trials or policepolitics something with the legal or justice systems with an apocalypse those things cease to exist unless it was a spoof i dont even see the logistics even if it were a rogue guy trying to bring justice to the world and solve crimes it wouldnt really fit with that genre maybe if it was based around a police station that made it through and is defending their town but i dont see a town agreeing to continue holding court in a zombie outbreak i think its just one of those rumors that got out and everyone hears once and it feels like fact even if it came from nowhere it would be a lot easier to just make a show based on existing material
television,not_removed,really sick of fionas put upon shit when she signed the papers to take over guardianship you literally signed up for this fiona literally also all too them are pretty much fucked up in some way or another so she can stop patting herself on the back any day now
television,not_removed,im pretty sure the company lip is working for is a shot at imgur also zero from holes is his boss
television,not_removed,the you will call her line was one of the best jokes i didnt get for so long hes telling mac to call a girl whos both deaf and mute
television,not_removed,this was all i could think about after that line thank you for the side by side
television,not_removed,on a side note im really glad for the actor to have landed this role i always liked him in sunny as well as i think it was house of cards and always thought hed belong in something more serious and major
television,not_removed,i really hope william gets to the end of the westworld maze only to find oil salesman charlie
television,not_removed,next up start breakin bricks wetnips
television,not_removed,i had to laugh out loud when i saw that scene in westworld thought the same thing love the comparison vid
television,not_removed,i hope william in westworld never drinks milk

television,not_removed,ive always been so oddly attracted to him
television,not_removed,its so hard to watch ww not laugh a little when hes on screen i keep thinking hes going to fork stab somebody
television,not_removed,i laughed my ass off at that scene and my friends had no clue why
television,not_removed,jimmie simpson is quickly becoming one of my favorite actors the way hes able to believably morph into totally different characters without really even changing his appearance like most character actors is great and hes able to take on a wide range of genres hell always be mary to me though
television,not_removed,great stuff but hell never top lyle the intern
television,not_removed,
television,not_removed,oh my
television,not_removed,i just watched this moments ago and thought the same shame he didnt do one in house of cards could have got the hat trick
television,not_removed,i immediately thought of always sunny i actually laughed out loud when i saw this and my wife had no clue what i thought was funny about this scene
television,not_removed,bump it
television,not_removed,i thought of this scene directly after hearing that scream in westworld this is one of my favourite scenesepisodes from sunny
television,not_removed,bump it
television,not_removed,ii only just now learned that thats the same dude the actor looked somehow familiar and yetnot and i never bothered to find out where i may have seen him before holy smokes
television,not_removed,my husbands immediate comment at that part was mcpoyle just made an appearance lol
television,not_removed,could have sworn the confederate host that he and delores found on the beach in the last episode was his mcpoyle brother
television,not_removed,the gang gets replaced by robots
television,not_removed,edward hands
television,not_removed,member breakout kings

television,not_removed,yeaaaah that was the first thing i saw him in hard to get this character out of my head
television,not_removed,danny devitos face is great in this
television,not_removed,commenting to find later when im not at work

television,not_removed,long time fan of sunny in philly i watched the esp of westworld last night and was thinking the exact same thing kudos for the post
television,not_removed,spoilers
television,not_removed,i am still waiting for him to fork stab someone in westworld
television,not_removed,probably lots more yelling clips in breakout kings
television,not_removed,and william just keeps getting more mcpoyley from then on out
television,not_removed,infinity upvotes
television,not_removed,i remember watching a dvd commentary for a movie he was in around the director said jimmi was going to be everywhere in a few years so glad that he was right
television,not_removed,holy shit i never even noticed it was the same guy top notch actor
television,not_removed,ive been watching westworld and keep referring to that guy as the creepy little rat dude i couldnt remember why i thought that i didnt think he was that bad in house of cards but i attributed it to that my resolved cognitive dissonance thanks you
television,not_removed,this is my favorite part in the whole series you just made it that much better
television,not_removed,the first time i truly couldnt stop seeing him as a mcpoyle he has been terrific in westworld but that scream was all iasip
television,not_removed,there used to be a compilation called the gang on economics or something like that i used to love to watch but it got pulled off youtube
television,not_removed,i was thinking this same thing when i watched thus episode of westworld
television,not_removed,jimmi simpson is becoming one of my new favorite actors hes proven very competent in comedy and is now playing an incredible role on ww i hope he keeps getting more roes
television,not_removed,this was the first thing i thought of when i heard that line on sunday

television,not_removed,he was perfect on breakout kings but that only lasted episodes
television,not_removed,yeah he is really blowing up the guy playing his brother on the other handnever saw him again
television,not_removed,he plays his role in cards wonderfully really sold me on the creepy antisocial guy that scared the life out of me
television,not_removed,to me he will always be lyle the intern
television,not_removed,leave the perverts guinea pig alone
television,not_removed,ive only seen him in person of interest before his character was such a charismatic lovable asshole millionaire was happy to see him get a somewhat leading role for a change
television,not_removed,he had a guest role on house as a hallucinating priest who was accused of molestation he nailed that part too
television,not_removed,he sold two mexican brothers ammo and vests on breaking bad
television,not_removed,have you seen hap and leonard he was good in that
television,not_removed,i love him in everything i see him in im on the fence about westworld but i love most of the actors so much that ill watch them do anything
television,not_removed,i remembered him most from when he would appear as lyle the intern on letterman cracked me up

television,not_removed,i saw one episode of this show at random one day thought it was awesome set my dvr to record the rest of the series and it never recorded a single episode a few months later i remembered that show i wanted to watch and looked up information only to find out it was cancelled
television,not_removed,never saw him again are you sure he wasnt just wearing a fake mustache
television,not_removed,hes in stan against evil with john c mcginley and the blonde chick from youre the worst its on ifc its an ash vs evil dead clone and it isnt very good but i watch it anyways

television,not_removed,hey im from vb small world you and about million other people are from vab
television,not_removed,he lived on wood st behind elwell going down the hill his house was the first and only house on that side of the block wood st to be exact i only remember that because it was the only house on wood st to party at i lived at east st rt next to the axp house and across the street from oip we lived there the year the university cracked down on frat parties so our house became party central wasnt uncommon to go through kegs a night edit remember the guy who died of meningitis it was a big deal on campus at the time the guy was jimmis roommate and i remember being at a party the weekend before he died we were at the party on friday and the guy died on monday so everyone was kind of freaking out who attended the party because apparently it is highly contagious and there was lots of germs being spread via beer pong
television,not_removed,i can hear it
television,not_removed,i couldnt resist screaming s thats what you get dolores you get gut stabbed
television,not_removed,no one understands the subtleties of charlies retardation better than me frank
television,not_removed,what do you see
television,not_removed,shes deeeeeeeead
television,not_removed,i also recommend watching all the bloopers from the whole show they are hilarious
television,not_removed,do you remember what episode this was i definitely missed it or maybe i heard it but was mesmerized by her moustache
television,not_removed,what
television,not_removed,whos this guy
television,not_removed,it isnt very good understatement of the year i didnt think it was possible for a show to be so awful the only reason i watched the whole thing was in hopes that every character would die and john mcginleys actual adventures would begin
television,not_removed,was he the guy on trial in jury duty yes the pauly shore movie or am i imagining that
television,not_removed,wow i didnt realize ash vs evil dead was successful enough to warrant such naked clones
television,not_removed,yeeeeehaw dives off wagon
television,not_removed,the night man in black
television,not_removed,youre about off population is roughly still lots of people though which makes car travel a pain in the ass anywhere in the tidewater area
television,not_removed,no need to be an asshole just thought it was cool
television,not_removed,
television,not_removed,what nothing
television,not_removed,more
television,not_removed,what a hero
television,not_removed,yeah they are great but than aids ruined everything
television,not_removed,the gang gets held hostage cant find a video on youtube but i found a transcript of the episode liam shes a deafmute the only reason she raised her hand is cause you guys did
television,not_removed,
television,not_removed,hes just dr cox but instead of healing people he kills them and instead of doing that dramatichallwaydoctor walk he does that dramaticoldguysitinchair bit but i cant stop watching
television,not_removed,i dont know i havent seen jury duty but im gonna get on that i love pauly shore
television,not_removed,seems like thatd be really easy to look up on imdb
television,not_removed,i wouldnt say that i think someone at ifc is just a really big fan of the evil dead franchise theyve seen how great the show is and they decided to write a show thats been heavily inspired by it and i do mean heavily cranky old man sexy young woman gory effects skinbound book etc it does seem to take the monsteroftheweek approach which is probably the weakest storytelling style around granted it can be effective if the writing is phenomenal but the writing that drives stan against evil is literally everything but i think it tries really hard to parody ash vs but the inherent problem there is that the franchise is a parody already so ifc is trying to parody a parody which means they have to go more overthetop than sam and ivan raimi do that extra overthetop just ruins the whole thing

television,not_removed,this american life did a podcast last year about busing and school segregation it takes place in the same st louis area school district that those parents were yelling at if you found this interesting than i recommend checking it out also
television,not_removed,is that a young mac playing mlk at the end
television,not_removed,is that guy who played the liberal white new yorkerman in the photo is he from old school college humor i think it is but i cant remember his name
television,not_removed,so how do you fix this i dont understand the busing system he talks about so they bus some poor black kids to rich white schools vice versa do they send rich white kids to poor black schools is this voluntary or just rng
television,not_removed,why can no one have an intelligent conversation about this its infuriating the problem as jon even points out is that race and class are still linked thats the issue were trying to fix you dont fix schools by reserving spots for different races you fix them by reserving spots for different classes schools should reserve spots for kids from other lower class districts ensuring that good education isnt only for high class neighborhoods it will accomplish the same thing but it wont fight racism with more racism systemic racism has given us a system we need to fix so try to fix the system dont just witch hunt for racism when you see inequality and think that calling it out will somehow fix the system weve been doing that for years and as the entire premise for this segment points out the problem is only getting worse because we havent fixed the system edit as others have pointed out leveling school funding to be equal across all state run schools by decoupling school funding from property tax would be an even better solution the problem is that some counties would be forced to help fund other counties schools which would cause an uproar in rich counties and you would still have inequality state by state it would be great if we could do it though
television,not_removed,its surreal seeing nick news used as a source amazing how heavy the topic of a news show aimed at kids could get also nick news lasted until who knew
television,not_removed,the weirdest thing about school segregation is how even so called liberals dont mind it as much as they should take samantha bee and her husband for example those two were literally campaigning against their kids school being rezoned because even though the area the school was in was lowincome the school was affluent and those great liberals were worried that poorer nonwhite lesser children would affect the quality of education or some bullshit edit as a user pointed out the issue was about relocation of the school not just rezoning i completely misremembered the main point stands however
television,not_removed,is there a significant difference between poor white schools and poor black schools race seems to be used as a heuristic to background but writing race directly into laws makes me uncomfortable if its really the best way to address this issue i can get behind it im not sure where to go for research though
television,not_removed,if you want to understand the housing policies that were able to create such a segregated society even after the civil rights act i suggest you start with this httpswwwpropublicaorgarticlelivingaparthowthegovernmentbetrayedalandmarkcivilrightslaw we read this in my sociology class to help understand why suburbs around the country are so white especially in new england
television,not_removed,how to enjoy a john oliver video never read the comments ever
television,not_removed,avoid the youtube comments they are unsurprisingly cancerous
television,not_removed,im not from usa so we dont have such a problem over here so i dont understand one thing that was mentioned a couple of times segregation through neighbourhoods so if you live in a mostly white area and that area has a school — obviously it will be mostly white kids there and this is bad why how you just go to the school in your neighbourhood and it is bad because there are not enough different races in there sorry maybe i missed something but i dont get how is this bad looks like pc and nothing else and what do you even do with that force children from other neighbourhoods come to this school to make it less white edit and also whats the matter with the kid so he painted his face to look more like mlk why is that racist and offensive
television,not_removed,why is john and his investigative teams immediate assumption that everything mentioned in their report can only be attributed to racism i mean surely you can make a strong case that a lot of that can be attributed to classism yet they dont even mention that
television,not_removed,off topic but i tuned in last night just to see if hed do the carlos danger shimmy
television,not_removed,voters routinely have to pass school bonds for their district because they dont receive adequate funding from the state they have nicer schools because they can afford to pay for them whats the solution for residents of a certain area wanting to tax themselves to pay for improvements in their area
television,not_removed,best way to increase student achievement is through parental involvement which has nothing to do with school funding if parents just take an interest in their kids schooling and hold them to a standard or help them with their homework student achievement increases dramatically when a parent shows no interest in a childs school the child usually wont either
television,not_removed,i dont find the white kids potrail of martin luther king racist but maybe someone can explain it to me why its wrong to paint yourself black in the face edit downvotes for asking a question thats on topic christ reddit can be up tight
television,not_removed,tricky issue the residents in good preforming schools will always fight this because they have a vested interest in not letting their schools get worse
television,not_removed,yeah this post wont go anywhere just look at the upvote percentage reddit is incapable of talking about racism some people deny it exists
television,not_removed,i dont always agree with oliver this is one of those times segregation was bad but you cant shit on new york for the districts they happen to have there are racial problems in this country but this is not one of them no matter your race isif you live in a poor neighborhood dont have a high income and dont have pools of taxable income for the schools in that area to have funding there isnt going to be a nice school thereit isnt rocket science it is only a racial topic because the poor areas happen to have people who arent white nobody cares about white people dealing with the same issue this is mostly a economic issue if ny had the space of the region they are being compared to which is the entire south for some reason you would see more diverse school districts and also i dont think the races really benefit that much from being together if anything it is innocuous as in they dont lose anything from being around the other group edit had to add that old propaganda im gonna take me a lick film was horribly racist and fucked up also i personally went to a school that is considered mostly african american ie were black an the rest was white asian or hispanicso i can tell you from experience it was kind of a hassle but besides from being called white boy and cracker and getting made fun of for being white occasionally it wasnt that bad
television,not_removed,is it different in canada because i went to a public elementary school where no one was rich but high school was different because they took only people with learning disabilities
television,not_removed,thinking about this issue its difficult for me to say if it really applies to the rural school system that i grew up in on one hand its just a majority white county my high school had the largest minority population and it was still white so there are no schools that are blacklatino like the ones talked about in the video on the other hand my neighborhood is white and the high school with the least diversity in the county is white which is in a small town with a large kkk chapter so i know segregation and racism is a problem but i dont know that this would help much to solve it
television,not_removed,you dont fix this by removing the segregation at the school level you do it by removing the segregation at the community level and having each community having representative numbers
television,not_removed,why are we afraid to admit that people prefer to live near people who are culturally similar to themselves why do politicians who often send their children to private schools and live in expensive neighborhoods think that the plebs should be forced to bus in a bunch of underperforming students while school funding should be equal this isnt just about funding despite this segment suggesting thats the case nj and dc area schools have poured in tons of money into underperforming schools and arent seeing results poor school districts with a culture that takes education seriously and has a low crime rate perform fine
television,not_removed,reminds me a little of the public housing policy that my country has close to live in public housing where there is a percentage quota for each of the major races for every housing estate this contributing in part to more diversified student populations
television,not_removed,race and class are inextricably linked john oliver is a racist
television,not_removed,daily dose of white guilt thanks﻿
television,not_removed,wonder what public school oliver sends his kids to﻿
television,not_removed,i just love seeing americans writhe and struggle with their shitty education system although its not really a system its more of a send your kids to the best school you can afford and hope that it isnt one of those schools that only teaches you to pledge allegiance to a multicoloured rag and to recite a list of dead presidents that nobody actually cares about and ifyoure lucky maybe youll even be taught creationism thats not to say that my own education system isnt shit but at least we have an actual education system an actual framework that even if it does a piss poor job at it is meant to bring out the best in students a system where good andor ambitious students will end up at a high school that teaches things like the riemann hypothesis or basic quantum mechanics now this system does a fucking poor job its terribly behind the times but at least it is a proper system that actually functions and unlike the us its actually considered to be among the top education systems in the world im not entirely sure how we got there although it probably involves everyone else not even trying kind of like how the us is the best at american football because theyre almost the only country that plays it hell making it better than the us yes fucking russia a barbaric shithole where all the media are controlled by the state not even the system in my country is as bad as russia and russian education is still considered better than the us american education is a joke
television,not_removed,misleading manipulation of data
television,not_removed,of course there are parents who just dont like black skin but i think what is occurring is culturalism not racism so often what you see is not the poor kids start acting like the rich kids but the rich kids start acting like hoodlums my son is very successful now much more than me and i credit that directly with the fact i did not allow him to associate with lazy people oh and he is a person of color
television,not_removed,this wil l probably be buried but the way to combat unequal schools isnt to bus specifically black or minority students to the suburbs its to just stop restricting school choice by geographical area if every student black white or otherwise had the option to attend any school they wanted to regardless of geography then the problem could be fixed without granting special privileges to certain races
television,not_removed,not covering crooked hilary ok time to unsubscribe from this tard
television,not_removed,that episode is insane i remember mowing the lawn listening to that town hall meeting with all the parents never has a podcast made me feel so physically sick to my stomach the worst part is i had seen something not too dissimilar happen in my own neck of the woods it was amazing seeing adults i had known my whole life get caught up in this debate furious at the prospect of their children possibly having to go to a school that while miles closer to our neighborhood had a much larger blacklatino population than the school we were originally slated to go for both schools were in one of the most prestigious school districts in the country too if theres one thing that makes people absolutely bonkers its the slightest deviation in their childs education
television,not_removed,i listen to this american life while im at work and during that school town hall and the girls reaction afterward i came so close to tearing up i had to leave the room and im an uppermiddle class white guy who never had to deal with any sort of school rezoning i really hope some of those parents learned that they were on this american life and realize what they were saying
television,not_removed,good episode also learn from a different podcast that is some deeds for houses they specifically state not to sell to blacks thats in southern california
television,not_removed,i second the recommendation very interesting episode
television,not_removed,i posted that link above such a powerful episode your heart really breaks for that girl who had to listen to all of those nasty things said during the town hall meeting
television,not_removed,
television,not_removed,i have a dweam
television,not_removed,for a segment i was paying close attention to the whole time because i was learning so much about things i never really considered when thinking about the issue to have a kid in blackface say i love black people was a real change up and had me bursting out laughing like oliver said he didnt know better but that kid is going to look back on it in a decade and face palm so hard
television,not_removed,dan gurewitch he is a writer for the show
television,not_removed,was literally just about to ask thatbeef gurewitch
television,not_removed,yup he shows up a lot in those little news windows hes on the writing staff youll also see show up in a similar capacity on samantha bees show
television,not_removed,its pretty accurate about ny you can see it when students are going to school depending on the school they go to they are almost all the same race predominately asian predominately latino predominately black also in the jobs people have construction seems fairly diverse aside from being male dominated but white collar work is dominated by whites and asians not entirely of course service jobs are dominated by black very awkward getting lunch or dinner and the line being a bunch of whiteasian yuppies and the workers all being black theres self segregation as well though try getting a date with a nonwhite if youre white man not sure how it is for women other races lgbt most stick either to their own race or even more specifically ethnic group or other poc too much racial division in general not sure if its as bad in other cities
television,not_removed,i wouldnt call myself a rich white kid but i was a white kid my school system redrew the school zone lines every year for a while i went to different schools in years from grade to grade there was a school about minutes from my house but i was zoned to go to a school minutes away which for some kids meant they had to wake up at and an hour long bus ride luckily i was able to carpool with my friends mom so i didnt have to catch the bus the school system was trying to create a more equal racial distribution in each of the schools but the problem was people would either move or use a false address when registering for schools so they could go to a school they werent zoned for which meant the school board had to redraw the school zones again the next year it was pretty stupid i think a diverse school body is a good thing but i dont think there is any easy way to force people desegregate waking kids up at so they can sit on a bus for an hour before school is not a good solution
television,not_removed,the only solution would be a total redo of american education something like straight up ending charter schools and any private educational institution receiving any public funding and would require strict oversight to meet federal guidelines donations to a private school would also not be deductible and would have to be taxed force literally everyone into a public system and then you can equalize funding and standards and even then youll still have millions of kids that are fucked because theyve missed out on reform this idea would only stop the problem from continuing onto the next generation
television,not_removed,why is presumed this needs to be fixed theres a big controversy in education right now because actual research has shown that students perform better when segregated by sex and race they do better academically and theres fewer discipline problems by a significant amount i was shocked to learn this too but this is what the textbooks said in my masters of education classes i couldnt believe that anyone would seriously argue for segregated education unless they were just hateful irrational racists now keep in mind were not talking about data from the and here were talking recent stuff and a lot of past studies have been torn apart for methodological problems see coleman et al but what weve settled on for now is that what has a real impact on achievement is socioeconomic makeup not racial makeup though in the past these factors were more closely correlated and in the past many teachers for segregated schools werent very qualified in other words integrating poor black kids with poor white kids is likely to lead to worse academic outcomes for everyone than had they remained segregated but integrating any poor kids with any rich kids is likely to do more good for the poor kids than harm for the rich kids however the poor kids dont perform better just because theyre learning alongside rich kids the reason kids in rich schools perform better is because they feel safer there are more advanced classes available they do more homework and their teachers expect more from them so instead of just busing poor kids to rich schools to feel like weve done something we need to work to improve those four factors in all schools we cant cram every poor kid into a rich school and we cant just leave most of the poor kids behind we need better teachers that we can hold accountable we need more funding for college prep courses we need more security at school and no that doesnt mean metal detectors and police in the hallways that actually makes students feel unsafe and we need to make the material fun and interesting enough that students will actually do their damn homework
television,not_removed,its not just a class thing though ill have to dig up a link later but poor whites are more likely to go to schools with affluent peers than poor blacks are think about white flight in the if a poor white kid moves into your white neighborhood you wouldnt notice if a black kid moves into your white neighborhood you definitely would thats what created these segregated schools in the first place white families fleeing from neighborhood schools where black students attended i highly recommend listening to this american lifes two part series please listen to the story about the little girl who attended a town hall meeting of a county that was desegregating and you will understand that this isnt just a class issue its very much a race issue
television,not_removed,the system of funding schools through local property taxes is what fucks over the us education system more than anything else the typical state education system in the us promotes inequality in education through the funding mechanism poor communities are given a lower standard of education because they are poor wealthy communities get high quality education because they are wealthy equalize funding across the entire state and you dont need to bus poor students around to wealthy schools
television,not_removed,why can no one have an intelligent conversation about this well to start one side of the political spectrum doesnt believe systemic racism and classicism classism exists so theyd have to admit it does before a conversation could start its like inviting your friends over to dinner and half of them declining because they dont believe you have a table to eat on despite the fact youve texted them pictures of the table and they have played poker on the table and made money off of it and their fathers literally built the table edit forgot to throw classicism in there my bad edit classism not classicism
television,not_removed,the problem with reserving seats for underserved kids is it doesnt guarantee success if you went to a shitty school in a shitty neighborhood college is going to be rough thats where kids should be served prek forward
television,not_removed,so race and class are linked but we should only focus on class
television,not_removed,meh i disagree i think you are approaching the issue at a level past the root cause of the problem why allow lower class districts at all if you are going to move people then you should be spreading the poor people amongst the different communities having lower class districts exist at all just creates ghettos you need to have affordable living spread evenly throughout all communities instead of letting all the poor people end up in the same shithole neighborhoods
television,not_removed,the problem isnt that class is a thing the problem is that parents with power money and influence prioritise what they believe to be their childrens futures over the needs of society and that usually involves providing support to the structures that maintain the status quo while nothing mobilises class solidarity like a threat to their kids
television,not_removed,i think you need to fix housing development first having developments that truly mix incomes leads to everything from schools to playgrounds are more classraceneutral low income housing developments reinforced the class divide that created a lot of these problems
television,not_removed,when you drill down into the data it isnt a race thing and it isnt even a class thing what matters in academic outcomes is do students feel safe does the school offer advanced courses do teachers have high expectations do students do their homework it just so happens that the answer to those questions is a strong yes in most rich schools we dont need to bus students around anywhere we just need to improve those factors in all of our schools uprooting children from one school and peer group and planting them in another is very bad for them in fact and the more you do to them the worse it is a kid that changes schools every year and never forms long lasting relationships with other students is very likely to have serious problems in social development
television,not_removed,what happened to linda ellerbee
television,not_removed,daily show correspondents telling people not to talk to the press beautiful
television,not_removed,source
television,not_removed,i guess you lost another full frontal viewer bee
television,not_removed,the school was affluent and those great liberals were worried that poorer nonwhite lesser children would affect the quality of education or some bullshit we cant have a frank conversation about this if people choose to live in a fantasy land where people assume children and their families have no impact on the quality of the learning environment
television,not_removed,was anyone else secretly hoping oliver mentioned beejones while watching this last night
television,not_removed,parents wanting their kids go to the best school possible what monsters
television,not_removed,thats interesting any record of this always good to have proof of the hypocrisy for when people pull their holier than thou card
television,not_removed,when you pay taxes and have kids youll understand
television,not_removed,from my understanding poor white schools only really exists in rural areas because poor whites in the cities and suburbs do not live in separate neighborhoods but rather are spread out in middle class neighborhoods
television,not_removed,white people cant be poor you bigot
television,not_removed,a comment with likes blames black lives matter for this its fascinating really
television,not_removed,i personally think its not a problem of race the bigger problem is wealth public schools are funded based on taxes in your neighborhood logically the richer your neighborhood means you will have more money you have to spend on schools systems thus you can afford to pay competitive salaries and youll likely have better public schools richer people tend to be white this is statistically true in the united states so you can see the connection rich white people live in zones with better schools its not a problem of theres not enough races in the schools the bigger problem is theres not enough wealth to be spread around to the other schools in different districts also painting your face black is considered blackfacing which is extremely offensive never ever do
television,not_removed,so if you live in a mostly white area and that area has a school — obviously it will be mostly white kids there and this is bad why how many people have an odd perception that despite the usa being white every neighborhood should being racially proportional despite the fact that the majority of people prefer to live around people who are similar to themselves
television,not_removed,force children from other neighbourhoods come to this school to make it less white now youre getting it edit and also whats the matter with the kid so he painted his face to look more like mlk why is that racist and offensive no reason people just say so its not racist or offensive
television,not_removed,did you watch the video separate but equal is not equal black schools get less funding black students attending nonminority schools where more than of the student body is students of color are more likely to graduate and less likely to be imprisoned etc etc etc honestly were you just not paying attention force children from other neighbourhoods come to this school to make it less white again there have been no negative effects on the white students in this situation you would know if you heard it in the video so he painted his face to look more like mlk why is that racist and offensive black face has been historically been used to make fun of black people it is extremely culturally inappropriate in the us
television,not_removed,i think he hinted at it with the calling out of white liberal new yorkers who think they are better than southerners but he didnt do a good job of expounding on it an important thing to note is that systemic racism doesnt require any racist thoughts feeling or beliefs although those thing all increase the chances of it coming into being if you had a computer program that assigned wealth and class randomly to citizens but it had a completely unintentional flaw that resulted in people of one race to be disproportionately poor that would still be an issue of systemic racism even without intent right now the us has more racial disparity in income and incarceration than sa under apartheid i dont believe that is because individuals in power are more racist but the system itself is more efficient at creating this disparity even if it is an unintentional side effect
television,not_removed,well a lot of it is attributed to racism you heard the town hall meeting where the lady said she didnt want her children getting stabbed or taking a drug or getting robbed her world view is so jaded that every person from the minority neighborhood that were going to get bussed in was a stabbing drug using robber how messed up is that
television,not_removed,why do these comments keep coming up he discusses that about minutes in with seperate counters analogy classism leads to systematic racism which is the theory discussed in the video if you wanna refute that you can but dividing the two without discussing why its untrue makes it look a lot like you and any other comments didnt understand or watch the video
television,not_removed,because he knows his audience dipshit middle class liberals who couldnt give a shit about the working class and the underclass but care a whole lot about racism at least in the new twitter woke sense
television,not_removed,because most of the zoning in the past was based off of race neighborhoods in new york were extremely segregated having parts with only irish italians blacks and chinese living in certain areas if you owned property you most likely gave those apartments to someone similar to you since it was extremely rare for black people to own property in new york like the rest of the races they usually ended up in poorer areas its extremely difficult to move yourself out of the bottom especially if there are very few willing to take a chance on you because of the color of your skin
television,not_removed,because they are pushing a narrative
television,not_removed,because almost all of the white people who are busy decrying racism are upper class the entire sjw clique is filled with uppermiddle to upperclass white women and nothing else they pretend to speak for all minorities in order to make their argument seem righteous but in reality are just fighting for the problems of rich white women they dont have it as good as rich white men but better than just about everybody else
television,not_removed,my girlfriend is a grade teacher at a under performing read immigrants and under poverty level families and she said the biggest obstacle to her kids learning is the lack of parental involvement now not all of her kids are in this situation but the ones that are happen to be the ones that hold everybody else back from learning to their full potential
television,not_removed,it is hard to be involved when you have to work more than the standard hours a day just to get by
television,not_removed,i think the point is that its not that the kid is racist just that he and his parent live in such a segregated world that they didnt realize that sending your kid to school in blackface wasnt a good idea
television,not_removed,it rubs people the wrong way because it reminds them of an old and racist style of makeup designed to draw humor from exaggerated racial stereotypes both visually and in actions imo the kids makeup didnt look too bad as you can tell no exaggerated features but a white person getting made up as a black person still has a very strong negative connotation
television,not_removed,that stuck out to me as well since i did the same thing as a teenager i went to school with the makeup on and placed in the costume contest i even went to work with the makeup its not like i did it to make fun of black people i did it because i wanted to portray my character like a mirror image when i went to work i deal with the public i heard the most racist things in my life painting your face isnt racist but the intent can be
television,not_removed,i dont think anyone denies racism exist but you cant even suggest something might not be all about race and you get a pretty hard backlash from the other side racism is a really hard subject to talk about because you have to do it logically and not argue from a place of emotion
television,not_removed,im not american and i live in a white country soo i cant say ive had hands on experience with racism however i see the exact same things here when it comes to lower middle and upper class i dont doubt that a lot in the video is due to racism but it just seems to me that oliver and his team immediately dismissed class as a causal factor for everything mentioned in the video when it is just as viable if not more of an explanation for some of the things mentioned
television,not_removed,same with sexism
television,not_removed,the way i understand it is the resulting segragated schools are a byproduct of racist laws specifically the racial zoning in the us back in the and so on blacks were kept in poorer neighborhoods and did not get the same opportunity for upwards mobility as whites by the time schools were officially nonsegregated the damage was already done and very few actions were taken to fix that damage
television,not_removed,no it isnt different schools on reserves are terrible and underfunded also the worst performing schools in the inner cities generally have more nations students
television,not_removed,i dont know bc all the rich people went to private school and the schools had pretty even distribution
television,not_removed,diversity gimmedat its all about minimizing what whites have worked for
television,not_removed,its the current year
television,not_removed,i think were trying but so far were not smart enough to fix the economic inequality problems out grandparents left us
television,not_removed,the people who replied to you are the reason why we cant have an actual discussion about this
television,not_removed,what year
television,not_removed,segregation happens naturally people go to where they feel comfortablewhere kids parents feel their kids could enjoy more or be safer
television,not_removed,you must be fragile to feel guilt when someone discusses broad social issues in society
television,not_removed,its guilt against racists who benefit from their skin color i dont know why thats so hard to figure out in this instance its guilt for white parents and officials who are at the top of the social class structure due to their race and want to keep minorities away based on false ideas that the presence of these children will poisonendanger their own kids the and is the point
television,not_removed,lol im sure his year old goes to the best public school
television,not_removed,that is not what ironic means
television,not_removed,why the downvotes do americans not understand how weird that everything is as good as you can afford do they not realize other capitalistic countries dont have privatesemiprivate education systems
television,not_removed,you do realize that this comment belies every claim youre making yeah because you are not a bright person
television,not_removed,ok what was misleading about it back up your claim
television,not_removed,what does this even mean he offered so many different examples and situations what data
television,not_removed,seeing as the only reason those people had for complaining was black people will attend this school im pretty sure this is about racism
television,not_removed,actually he did cover that story this week his show has more news than just the featured story that gets online
television,not_removed,he did cover it so does this mean you will resubscribe
television,not_removed,theres been a demographic shift in the school i teach at fights have gone up then parents will just open charters or push to secede from the district then youre left with the same problems
television,not_removed,one of the absolute worst things that will negatively effect a childs socioeconomic outcomes is switching schools every few years there are also certain ages where switching schools is absolute devastating to a childs chance though i cant recall them specifically off the top of my head if you want whats best for you child then you find a good safe school that offers advanced courses and has teachers with high expectations for their students and you keep that kid in that school system with those peers until they go to college thats what research shows matters again safe school no cops roaming the halls do not make kids feel safe high expectations observe the teachers as they teach if the teachers dont give a fuck what the students are doing do not put your child in that school advanced courses even if your kid isnt a genius he will try harder to keep up with the kids studying stuff over his level make your kid do his damn homework keep your kid in that same school system
television,not_removed,theres also the reverse in washington dc
television,not_removed,thanks found while searching its been eight years since the summer of music the years start coming and they really dont stop coming oh sarah is now cohead writer for snl the college humor crew has really gone places
television,not_removed,white kids have been bussed to poor majority black schools before thats been in my experience the central part of the problem no one wants their child who attends an acceptable school to attend a school where there are a lot of problems and the student is in the minority thats why say in new orleans parents work especially hard to send their children to private schools i have to say i wouldnt have a problem with a mixed race school at all for my child but sending my child to a substandard school id find a route out of that stat
television,not_removed,force literally everyone into a public system and then you can equalize funding and standards i agree that the wealthy getting to pick schools and the poor being unable creates these problems but i think banning choice in schooling is a bad solution httpsenwikipediaorgwikiabbottdistrict has been tried and it didnt work i agree with people like cory booker instead of closing private and charter schools why not create more of them and then give everyone a voucher to choose which school they want to go to instead of forcing children to go to whatever shitty school is in their district parents should be able to choose whichever school they want to send their child to and not worry about paying for it
television,not_removed,only stop the problem from continuing onto the next generation thats literally the entire point of education reform it only helps people who are currently in school but it hopefully makes the next generation smarter and more productive that creates a benefit to the people who didnt get to use those schools because it creates a wealthier tax base
television,not_removed,too many upvotes for coercion and elimination of choice
television,not_removed,how about online education and then everyone does the same test money would be routed toward building infrastructure so everyone can have access to internet a lot of teachers would be out of job though
television,not_removed,i think this is a really important point yes there are a lot of poor white demographics i would think this would be more applicable in even rural areas too that have a lot of the same issues as poor minorities it is also important to consider the decades of housing discrimination and other discriminatory policies that have restricted the upward mobility of minorities that poor white people dont necessarily experience there are a lot of classist policies but its also important to account for systemic racism as well theres a podcast called the united states of anxiety that did an episode on italian immigrants back in the day they experienced similar poverty and discrimination as other minorities but eventually they learned to anglicize their names to be able to even get through the application process for jobs blacks didnt have this opportunity because of their skin tone they would still face discrimination to be hired
television,not_removed,ill listen to the podcast thanks for the link poor whites are more likely to go to schools with affluent peers than poor blacks are what youre pointing out is that affluent neighborhoods have better schools because of the funding structure of american schools the more wealthy the neighborhood the better funding the local schools if a lower class white kid lives near higher class piers they are going to benefit from this it could mean that our neighborhoods are still too segregated if a poor white kid moves into your white neighborhood you wouldnt notice if a black kid moves into your white neighborhood you definitely would well that doesnt match my experience but this all depends on where you live i suppose i have lived in la and atl where ive regularly been one of the only white kids in my neighborhoods so i wouldnt have noticed the skin color of new kids in my neighborhood but if youre saying that some people do take notice and try to keep minorities out then yes thats definitely a practice that we know was happening explicitly as recently as the and could still be happening implicitly now we should definitely be continuing to reinforce our system that makes racial bias illegal in the housing market and every other market you cant make neighborhoods open to all classes but they should obviously be open to all races white families fleeing from neighborhood schools where black students attended white flight occurs when housing prices drop and crime goes up which happens when lower classes move in unfortunately this is often linked to black families moving in because race and class are still linked you dont see white flight when rich asian families move into neighborhoods because people dont flee from higher classes not to say that white flight is not also racially motivated sometimes but at the end of the day the way you stop people from moving is by fixing the class inequality not by trying to shame them into staying put
television,not_removed,totally agree with this
television,not_removed,and one side of the political spectrum are a bunch of hypocrites did you miss the first part where this is about very liberal new york
television,not_removed,i would have thought you were making that up or talking about a very tiny fraction of the population if i hadnt just read some of the youtube comments i just hope those people remember to go out and vote november
television,not_removed,and on the other side you have people who call everything racist and who believe that white people are inherently privileged blaming people isnt going to help you completely ignored the comment youre responding to its classicism edit classism that is the problem guess how a lot of people on the everything is racist side try to fix it they try to fix it with more racism both sides have people who arent actually trying to fix the problem the issue is that there are people who dont just take the extremists seriously but who believe that the extremists have a good point
television,not_removed,not sure what youre talking about the only people i hear advocating race based affirmative action are liberals no one on the right would fight class based affirmative action affirmative action as it stands is systemic racism so to sit here and say well i wish i could talk about it but i cant doesnt help anyone because you can talk about it by advocating the change
television,not_removed,you can believe in classism without believing in systemic racism they arent the same thing and its usually the people that believe in systemic racism that are undervaluing the actual effect of classism he asked for an intelligent conversation not more dumbfuck asshattery like what youre offering
television,not_removed,explain that by the end of the school day as many as students of asian descent had been physically attacked and many were sent to the hospital for treatment according to school and law enforcement officials on december racial tensions at the school reached a fever point as more than two dozen asian students were attacked inside the building one day by a group of mostly african american students in some cases kids were literally drug out of classrooms yes systematic do exist there is a reason white and asian people dont want to go to black schools
television,not_removed,i dont think we should only focus on class but it would likely produce better shortterm results if we focus more on class
television,not_removed,you should be spreading the poor people amongst the different communities im a bit confused but interested youre saying states should be able to set housing prices across every school district to give poor people equal number of places to live in each district that seems like a complete logistical and economic nightmare tbh for example how would districts in nyc somehow equalize itself to a random district in upstate new york manhatten has to offer housing at the same prices as every other district in the state i think we could achieve what you want just by decoupling school funding from local property tax all schools should be funded the same across the state per child regardless of who lives nearby
television,not_removed,not if it means i have to live next to some crackhead of any color
television,not_removed,it just so happens that the answer to those questions is a strong yes in most rich schools right but those schools are rich because they are funded in part by the property taxes on the residents of the county so if a county has higher class residents with higher priced properties the schools are better funded and have better education thats why its a class issue our education system is a positive feedback loop in regards to where kids live growing up uprooting children from one school and peer group and planting them in another is very bad for them in fact probably true so we should be leveling the playing field for school funding all state run schools should get the same amount of funding regardless of which county theyre in
television,not_removed,linda ellerbee retired she was she did the show for over years i say she earned some rest
television,not_removed,
television,not_removed,oh sorry my comment was worded poorly i totally understand that kids from lowincome households have a tougher time performing well in school when compared to kids from highincome households thats not my point my point is that it is at the end of the day a form of discrimination to try to keep kids from lowincome households away from your school regardless of the logic behind it you think if something like this happened in south carolina jason and sam would be giving white sc parents the benefit of the doubt talking about how its unfortunate that black kids are being kept out of highperforming schools but at the same time black kids are more likely to be from lowincome households so we cant really blame white parents fuck no thered be an entire bit about how were looking at racism and discrimination in action im calling out their hypocrisy in being the kind of progressives that argue yeah we need the government to intervene on the behalf of those facing discrimination until it personally mildly inconveniences me
television,not_removed,cant just give up on people either we all live in the same society
television,not_removed,did you watch the video it directly addressed this and the evidence proved that while black students benefited from racial integration white students were not affected
television,not_removed,you pay taxes even if you dont have kids making sure children grow up so they can properly contribute to society is beneficial to everyone in the long run if you dont feel that way homeschool is always an option
television,not_removed,so instead of a separate ghetto its just the smaller house on the corner here and there
television,not_removed,its fascinating the total failure to understand context that that kind of commenter has
television,not_removed,also painting your face black is considered blackfacing which is extremely offensive never ever do yeah but explaining why might be helpful the reason why blackface is incredibly racist is because historically in the united states when a black character would be cast in a play or movie it would be done by a white person in blackface would often be portrayed in a mocking way making the character dumb or violent etc
television,not_removed,there is a long history of blackface being used in moviesplaysother to portray blacks as bumbling idiots so blackface is considered racist because a very common use of it up until modern days was incredibly racist
television,not_removed,black schools get less funding thats not segregation issue but the schooldistrict its like saying school in the middle of nowhere gets less funding than a school in ny city no shit the problem is that the districtcounty is funding schools not the state itself why not fix the funding issue instead like splitting the money between schools or make funding regulations like its done in every other country again there have been no negative effects on the white students in this situation you would know if you heard it in the video did i say otherwise it looks like youre trying to find something to be offended by in my post and i was just asking yes it sounds weird to force children to go to school which is far away from their house just to be pc and maintain a good number of races in a statistics report why would a kid want to take longer trips to school every day and even more — why would he want to leave his neighbourhood and im not talking about race just as is if i live in x why would i want to go to y to school youll say because the y school is better well thats the policydistrictfunding problem isnt it and instead of making school in x better the same level as school in y you want to force children to switch schools problem solved i guess black face has been historically been used to make fun of black people do you think the kid intended it to be offensive and make fun of someone if no whats the fucking point its kinda hard to portray mlk if youre not black eh edit i dont understand why are being so angry at me either
television,not_removed,very unfortunately that disparity is getting worse in postapartheid sa edit as for my high school i have a more positive story i attended a former model c school which toward the end of apartheid was a white school with decreased government funding and more private funding these were and still are some of the best schools in sa my school was pretty racially diverse although most students were afrikaans speaking most were not white colored people are mostly afrikaans as well initially classes of each year were divided by grades we ended up with all the best classes being mostly white and the lower classes mostly nonwhite this did not look good so every year the kids with the lowest grades were placed into the highergrade classes their grades were significantly improved because of this this is for my school though a lot of public schools dont get happy endings
television,not_removed,there is a difference an important one is the system inherently racist or just really good at keeping people in their designated wealth bracket if you are born rich youll most likely stay rich if you are born upper middle class youll probably stay upper middle class etc etc etc again i did say that this is related to racism because a large reason of why there are soo many poor minorities was racism in the past but in todays climate it might be more to do with class a middle class miniority household often has virtually the same benefits as the white middle class household from my understanding why is this important it is important because it means that your efforts would be better spent solving poverty and the class divide and that you will achieve better results doing that than tackling racism again a very similar if not identical patern presents itself in many developed countries around the globe even the ones which are very homogenous the rich have their own posh private schools the middle class has their own schools and the lower class is usually relegated to whatever is left this is not a uniquely american thing the same problems arise in literally every country on the planet instead of looking at it as integrating miniorities into more diverse schools how about looking at it as integrating the poor into upper middle class schools
television,not_removed,the entire sjw clique is filled with uppermiddle to upperclass white women and nothing else doo doo doo doo who needs nuance and reason when you can just make a mad objective claim
television,not_removed,asian immigrants did it
television,not_removed,the amount of shit that kid probably got on the internet and probably still gets was probably enough to eventually make him a little racist
television,not_removed,why nobody can ever say why except that years ago people did it in a stupid way he wasnt being disrespectful
television,not_removed,but a white person getting made up as a black person still has a very strong negative connotation except sometimes it doesnt and instead you get you nominated for a golden globe for best supporting actor
television,not_removed,race is intrinsically linked to class and will be until huge systemic changes are made such as the ones described in the video its reductionist to talk about this like its a class issue when different races are disproportionately poor
television,not_removed,ugh you are so lucky we waste sooooo much time talking about race in the usa like they got rid of slavery and made such bad decisions about how to integrate that we end up with this mess i really wish we could have just taken any person who was brought to the usa against their will given them reparations and sent them back to where they were taken from we blew it and by we i mean the usa in the
television,not_removed,why waste time on a non issue unless you actually mean sexism against men
television,not_removed,i guess so like i said if you are a poor white person in the same situation you are also completely fucked you still get a bad education and deal with the lack of funding you still deal with racism because of the school sees you with a different skin color and makes fun of you for it but you dont get to chalk it up to anything besides living in a poor neighborhoodi used to figure it was because when there is a low income area there wont be enough money for a good school in said area i get what you are saying but i feel like this ultimately boils down to a socioeconomic issue rather than a race issue
television,not_removed,worked for on the backs of oppressed minorities
television,not_removed,nope
television,not_removed,sometimes it offers great perspective like i cant believe guts finally got off that fucking boat in the current year
television,not_removed,there is nothing natural about segregation it is the result of housing discrimination and racialized economic inequality if it were natural things like this wouldnt need to happen httpsenwikipediaorgwikiredlining
television,not_removed,yes i did i watched the segment when it aired hours ago
television,not_removed,explain that by the end of the school day as many as students of asian descent had been physically attacked and many were sent to the hospital for treatment according to school and law enforcement officials on december racial tensions at the school reached a fever point as more than two dozen asian students were attacked inside the building one day by a group of mostly african american students in some cases kids were literally drug out of classrooms
television,not_removed,yeah just because other places are capitalist doesnt mean that you cant get a decent education if youre poor something that is very difficult in the us although where i live education is actually heavily socialised this is mostly due to demand people simply dont want private schools private schools are often not really better and can even have more freedom to fuck up public standards are too high for most private schools to be worth it most schools are either public schools or special schools which are a weird mix of public and private theyre basically semiprivate but not quite these special schools have a lot of freedom but both types are typically held up to a lot of scrutiny they have to meet very strict standards for which there are welldefined measures in practice schools are mostly free to do what they want as long as they meet those standards but if they dont theyll go bankrupt very fast high schools are also divided into several levels the level you attend mostly depends on your intelligence and ambition and unless you live in a particularly rural area where theres almost no people and thus very few schools every level is easily available to you people in those rural areas may have to travel a bit to attend certain school levels at least thats the theory i have a lot of issues with the system a long story short i think the standards are still too low although they are higher than most other countries and there are subjects that should be offered at every school at least as an optional course but that arent actually offered for example informaticscomputer science
television,not_removed,yep all you have to do is open up a private school and price out the people you dont want this makes the public school even worse since part of the population will never vote to increase funding for schools since theyre already paying private school tuition
television,not_removed,fuck homework its a cancer eating away childhood
television,not_removed,though it seems jake and amir cant seem to escape
television,not_removed,what sucks is thats why weve still got the shitty schools its a self perpetuating problem
television,not_removed,yeah i can completely see that argument and agree with it
television,not_removed,it comes down to funding the major problem of the minority schools being substandard is that they get less funding than white schools if you can invest in schools that do badly and raise the quality of education the problem will partly fix itself this is being tried in parts of germany right now after we encountered the same problem in many of our bigger cities many schools with a high number of immigrants started to do worse than german only schools which only got perpetuated when germans started to enlist their children in mostly german only schools to fight this there are a couple of measures in place first of all the schools got a higher emphasis on helping students with any kind of german language deficits to catch up many immigrants dont speak german at home and are hugely unprepared when enlisting to school which lets them start at a disadvantage right from the start the other measure is simply money schools got better funding for a better curriculum and in equipment and those schools got special counselors that can see eventual problems in the development of a child and try to solve it be it problems at home poverty bullying or other type of aggression and the numbers are promising the differences in performance between privileged and poor kids narrowed down drastically violence and bullying decreased and remarkably the number of poor immigrant students that identify themselves as german or part of germany have quadrupled this is a core problem of german immigration the critisism is that immigrants dont want to integrate themselves into german society and wont ever be able to these numbers show that its actually pretty easy to achieve if you show poor immigrant students that they are valued equally in the end its about money and that is the problem i think there needs to be the will to invest that much money knowing that if will benefit society only in years and not immidiately this is why it makes me sceptic that it will be implemented in germany as policy but if you have the will to change things it is easily achievable
television,not_removed,wouldnt everyone just pick the best school
television,not_removed,vouchers work up until the point that a muslim student decides to go to a religious school christian schools are obviously kosher
television,not_removed,the reforms i think are needed would likely hurt some of the currently well off students however which is why i would see it as very hard to implement taking even a single step back to take many teps forward is an extremely tough sell
television,not_removed,there are no easy and pretty problems to these issues no one can magically fix these problems without there being costs anyone that thinks that they can fix these issues easily is lying to you
television,not_removed,well thats a novel solution im not sure how well it would work in practice but it atleast interesinting in theory care to go on
television,not_removed,it could mean that our neighborhoods are still too segregated well in that case to the liberal mind the plan is obvious force rich white people to move into the crimeridden black areas hey its for diversity suppose you did that in one month the minorities would be complaining how their neighborhood has sold out to the man
television,not_removed,i postulate that white people fleeing from an area full of high performing chinese and indians will become a thing at some point in the future this is obviously anecdotal but ive heard plenty of complaints that go along the lines of i just want my kids to have a normal childhood therere too many asians here too much competition or something similar theres never anything explicitly racist it at least i dont hear it because im not particularly sympathetic to that sentiment and i generally speak upbut i dunno im not really sure if it even matters considering most of the asians we import are the smartest richest or most qualified ones from their countries and they tend to be extremely well off
television,not_removed,yep everyone is just pointing fingers
television,not_removed,i think of youtube commenters are people with extreme agendas not just far right and their sock puppet accounts and angstytrolly teenagers being manipulated by those people which is scary if they continue thinking that way as adults
television,not_removed,im right there with you i was stunned and disappointed by the comments section on that video what worried me is that a lot of people seemed to dismiss the obvious data driven facts of poor minority schools simply because they dont believe in systematic racism and you know what fine dont believe it was caused by systematic racism but dont deny that there is a problem right now diversity in schools is needed regardless if racism was the cause or economic pressures or random chance im can live with you disagreeing about what the cause was but dont deny the existing issue and lets work to fix it lets forget about what caused this and see if we can work on a solution together yes ideally knowing the cause helps a solution but if we sit at a stalemate because we cant agree on a cause nothing happens lets just take the first step together
television,not_removed,november
television,not_removed,who believe that white people are inherently privileged the two testers in each pair were matched on gender age and family composition and assigned the same financial characteristics with each tester presenting as unambiguously and equally well qualified to rent or buy the advertised unit testers independently recorded the treatment they experienced including information about all the homes or apartments recommended and shown thats an example of privilege if its not privilege what would you call the fact white people are discriminated less against in the housing market
television,not_removed,i forgot to add the word classicism that was my bad i fixed it
television,not_removed,and then you get stuff like this where people just say race doesnt affect class la la la
television,not_removed,i find affirmative action squarely in the complicated middle of my how do i feel about this scale so im not going to argue about whether its systemic racism or not regardless there is still a problem here yes the majority of the the right would not fight classbased affirmative action but only the barest minimum of the right are fighting for classbased affirmative action im fairly conservative so i hope this doesnt come across as mudslinging to anyone but the right has a real problem with decrying all the policies from the left without also advocating for a real alternative policy or a workable compromise to fix the issues at hand
television,not_removed,im not saying itd be easy or cheap it would be worth it i think though maybe have the government buy random houses at market value when they go for sale in various neighbourhoods and offer cheap accommodation there for poor people prioritising those with young children through government housing initiatives its a massive problem and it doesnt have a quick cheap or easy solution that doesnt mean the problem should be ignored and you dont fix problems by treating the symptoms you need to treat the root cause
television,not_removed,am i the only one who never saw nick news on nickelodeon i always wanted to watch it but never saw it playing
television,not_removed,thank you it seems a bit more than simple rezoning in this case though as they are talking about physically relocating the school
television,not_removed,you just described why leftists dont like liberals
television,not_removed,i dont think its hypocritical to want more equal funding for schools while not wanting underperforming students dumped into your school making kids ride the bus for an hour to go to another school district will exacerbate the problem of lack of local accountability and parental involvement if you think about it bussing students to another school is in many ways the same sort of someone elses problem mentality this is why im against the gops school choice nonsense
television,not_removed,my grandpa grew up as a poor farmer and went to elementary school in a one room schoolhouse hes incredibly smart and the facilities werent holding him back money isnt the biggest factor its how seriously the children and their families take education
television,not_removed,id like to know the scope of such a study along with the racial makeup of the school
television,not_removed,yup
television,not_removed,basically i live in a nice neighborhood where the average house is maybe and theres an area near main street where the places are a lot smaller and sometimes they split houses in to condos those go for half or less of the average
television,not_removed,oh thank you i did not know that makes more sense now
television,not_removed,so blackface is considered racist because a very common use of it up until modern days was incredibly racist it takes a dim mind to not be able to distinguish between mocking blacks and admiring blacks the kid did the latter shame on the bullies oliver included who admonish the kid for his admirable portrayal of mlk
television,not_removed,it isnt currently racist
television,not_removed,thats not segregation issue but the schooldistrict again you obviously did not watch the video as white students entered minority schools funding increased it looks like youre trying to find something to be offended by in my post i was just surprised because you made several points that have been mentioned in the video but the only one who sounds mad is you as for your entire second paragraph you again made many points which have already been mentioned white children and black children both benefit from forced integration spending minutes longer on the bus isnt hurting anyone do you think the kid intended it to be offensive and make fun of someone please tell me more about how you feel about something that you never dealt with jesus you dont get to decide whats offensive or not i am telling you that it is deeply offensive to most black americans you arguing that its not doesnt change shit
television,not_removed,i think the problem has to do with noticeability of poverty vs race and with political power people notice race more and are more likely to flee and we put up with crap in minority schools that we would be less likely to put up with in white schools the this american life podcast mentioned on this thread is enlightening a black missouri school district was failing so badly it had to be marked as an unaccredited leading to busingforced integration technicaly on a non racial basis since under law they had to allow students to transfer to a non failing school district what ended up happening is that the state officials ended up playing word games reclassifing the school district in a new not accredited category so they could stop bussing
television,not_removed,we have evidence of actual racism and racially motivated laws and policies but ill leave that aside and get sucked into just discussing class dynamics so the system works to maintain class structures the us system is fairly decentralized in much of its day to day decision making many of the decisions that effect people happen with low amounts of information about the people in question one important bit of class mobility is the hiring process so lets look at resumes without a background check well written resumes will do little to inform a potential hireer about race or class so two identical resumes even when they come from people of different backgrounds should be treated nearly equally but they arent resumes with black sounding names are more likely to be ignored than ones with white or racially neutral names this has been confirmed by studies using identical resumes with different names this has also been studied with school papers with similar results same papers get lower grades this is true even when the person making the decision has no signs of racism or is even of black themselves lets look at this entirely from the perspective of class and remove individuals being racist from the equation if the system discriminates based on class but has low information regarding class how does that work it uses what information it has a white person from a poor class background will sometimes easily pass as someone from a middle class background a black person from a middle class background has to deal with the probabilistic determination that based of hisher race that heshe comes from a low class background this is one of the reasons why black americans are more likely to slide back into the low class from the middle class than white americans and less likely to rise from the low class to the middle class this is why this is a racial issue
television,not_removed,httpswwwbrookingseduresearcheconomicmobilityofblackandwhitefamilies it isnt just a class thing economic mobility is worse for some races than others by extremely significant amounts
television,not_removed,dont worry the rich white women will take note of your value signaling and allow you into the club any second now just wait for it keep waiting oh looks like nothing happend
television,not_removed,as an asian american i can tell you no they didnt if you look at the demographic of high achieving first and second generation of asian american students in schools youd see a common similarity between their parents immigration patterns asian americans appear wealthy and educated only because of the vetting process for most asian immigrants its a very stringent process that only accepts some of the best of the best top level engineers and businessmen investorimmigrants who have loads of cash to spend on property people who come here on highskilled employment visas and foreign students seeking higher education opportunities in the us all of those immigrants have already come from educated and in many cases wealthy backgrounds thats why their children generally perform well in school contrast that with other demographic of asian americans particularly specific refugee populations youll see the cycle of poverty does indeed continue if the vast majority of asian immigrants were originally poor sustenance farmers instead of the the already educated elite then i can guarantee you that the asian american demographic would be one of the poorest populations in america
television,not_removed,asian immigrants werent brought to this country against their will i know im being polarizing but you cant compare black people to asian latino or irish immigrants because they came to this country under different circumstances
television,not_removed,a good analogy i heard is if you were going to a costume party dressed up like a ninja or bruce lee you would probably not tape the sides of your eyes back to make yourself asian
television,not_removed,the wasnt that long ago
television,not_removed,he wasnt intentionally being disrespectful but theres still a lot of history behind it that needs to be taken into consideration i wouldnt give the kid shit for it he didnt know any better but he should still be filled in on why he shouldnt continue to do it also this idea that it was years ago is complete bullshit maybe it started years ago but it happened for a very long time and i assure you that there are still plenty of people alive today who were around when that overthetop offensive blackface was a thing hell there are plenty of examples of blackface on television and we definitely didnt have those years ago as for the representing someones physical features isnt racist comment you made elsewhere it wasnt racist until people made it racist and used it as a way to hate and demean an entire group of people again historical context so yeah
television,not_removed,
television,not_removed,okay lets say we fix the racism issue entirely it wont magically in itself solve the class divide at some point you need to start focusing on tackling the classism issue not even acknowledging it is a serious tell that something is wrong these are just my cents but as ive stated in my other comments i see the exact same thing here outside of america where race cannot be the causal factor now it follows that if america was not racist at all it would still have similar problems maybe it would mean that gradually over the generations the proprotion of races in each class would eventually even out great now youve shifted the problem but you still have poor kids in poor schools and rich kids being afforded all the advantages they can get to keep them rich how about at least tackle both problems at once instead of just singularly focusing on racism because at least to me thats where your immediate attention should be i dont mean to be a reductive asshole but to me it seems that in america classism is the last place people look when it comes to social inequality even though it is the country with one of the biggest wealth divides on the planet
television,not_removed,particularly when the classes formed as a function of race
television,not_removed,didnt say things like that didnt exist
television,not_removed,im fine trimming a lot of the fat in the school curriculum so that kids dont have to spend so much time doing homework these days the fact is you can hand a curious kid a tablet and theyll learn more online than any school anywhere
television,not_removed,ch has a smaller audience but probably makes them more money and gives them a lot more artistic integrity
television,not_removed,that may be but you should expect that parents look out for their children first and foremost not the school system
television,not_removed,ive often thought that money is the issue but ive also seen a lot of shitty school districts where they actually get more per child than the suburbs and often substantially more
television,not_removed,they didnt really talk about it in this segment probably because it was only minutes long but the students who come from better schools also receive a net benefit better exposure to different cultures and people ends up being a huge boon when you go out into the real world the this american life version of this story also mentioned that theres no statistically significant decrease in achievement for the well off students
television,not_removed,schools would work like a computer lab you would have a bunch of teachers in a room with some tech guys to take care of the computers teachers would work like tas instead of lecturing they would just answer questions when asked not many of them are needed for this so prolly a lot of teachers would lose jobs department of education would release a list of certified video lectures notes and exercises available to everyone along with a progress map to let students know what is prerequisite of what tests for each subject would be issued by doed in intervals so for example maybe you can take algebra exam once every months or sth students would be able to learn and progress at their own pace instead of being dragged along the class like right now there are a bunch of downsides to this system first testing only work with multiple choice questions you can still teach them writing and math analysis but theres no way to grade their answers on the test without human graders theres a lack of social aspect as well you prolly hear a lot of ppl say going to school is all about building connections which is unlikely to happen when you study online even in a room full of ppl no chance for recommendation letters either but if you are poor cheap access to education is probably the priority here and then theres motivation i consider myself a decently diligent student but i find it hard to complete online courses
television,not_removed,one thing to mention though that could be controversial is that the poor disadvantaged kids in this scenario were held to the high standard that was expected from the affluent kids i do think this is a more classist part of the issue when children who have a better support systemability to do more outside of school theyll most likely have a better opportunity to do better in school i think there are a lot of aspects of this that arent being discusseddealt with to the extent that it should be for example the teachers for america in poor schools thing where you have temporary teachers who may not necessarily devote as much time or develop a relationship with the students to the extent that is necessary while this obviously doesnt all fall onto the teachers there are so many other types of policies that could help to improve these type of schools which i dont think i know enough about to discuss it more in depth i do think there are times in these conversations especially when they are occurring outside of academic communities where policing of language can be a huge detriment to being able to discuss the changes that need to be made some policies are pretty applicable to most races but the intersection of class and race also needs to be considered to account for the disproportionate number of minorities that tend to be affected for numerous reasons
television,not_removed,it could mean that our neighborhoods are still too segregated well in that case to the liberal mind the plan is obvious force rich white people to move into the crimeridden black areas hey its for diversity suppose you did that in one month the minorities would be complaining how their neighborhood has sold out to the man is being gentrified fixed that for you
television,not_removed,the neighborhood i live in has been heavily hispanic for the last couple of decades now young white people are moving here because its one of the only affordable neighborhoods in the city while mostly everyone seems cool with it there is some anger about it and my wife has been accused directly of being party to forcing out minorities by hispanic women we feel bad that people are upset but its not like we can afford to live anywhere else its not a race issue its a class issue we might be a different race than our neighbors but were in the same class not trying to make a point here but just giving a personal experience
television,not_removed,
television,not_removed,is that really needed here in france the governement wants diversity and takes people from all classes in the same area in the same public school results private schools are created and general level is lower than ever also the whites that live in the area with a lot of arabs and blacks are likely to vote the extreme right and there certainly some background for that
television,not_removed,diversity is largely irrelevant in academic outcomes a student isnt going to learn better just because hes sitting next to someone of a different race the problem is that a lot of black kids happen to be poor and most poor kids go to shitty schools you cant cram every poor kid into a rich school and how do you justify busing one poor kid to a rich school while you leave the other poor kid behind at the poor school a better solution is to improve the poor schools as having a child switch schools is in itself likely to harm a students socioeconomic outcomes we need to get rid of this system of funding school with property taxes and get something better otherwise schools for poor kids will always be poor we need to offer more advanced courses in all schools we need to do a better job of making kids feel safe no that doesnt mean have more cops patrol the halls and we need to be able to hold teachers accountable when they stop caring about their students a teachers expectations are everything
television,not_removed,its not racism its classism its very similar and yet far less objectionable to talk about if you actually appreciate it for what it is people dont fucking like it when you accuse them of hating black children when you acknowledge that poor districts have less money though thats not a result of hate its just common sense segregation by class is what causes these issues i agree but i dont think you fix it by treating a symptom i think we need to create affordable living in all communities and abolish the idea of low class districts and high class districts entirely
